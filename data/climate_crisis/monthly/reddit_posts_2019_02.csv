I am tired of feeling powerless in addressing the climate change crisis (crises). That said, I believe reddit offers a platform to organize and turn a small group into a large group, and a large group into a united voice for policy change. That said, I just subscribed here and want to share two other sub-reddits where environment-minded folks are beginning to organize their voices.
