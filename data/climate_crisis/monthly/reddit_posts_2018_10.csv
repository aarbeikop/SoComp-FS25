"9kgefn","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2018 q3","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for almost 3 years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.

"9sdohh","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","If climate change is going to turn out as bad as scientists are predicting why aren't we all freaking out?","If the models for climate change are correct we can expect the following within the next few decades:

* food shortages and mass famine
* droughts
* deadly heatwaves in large parts of the world
* more frequent or extreme natural disasters
* islands and coastal regions being submerged

All of the above factors will lead to...

* wars over resources
* a rise in extremist groups
* civil strife and war
* multiple huge migrant movements that make the Syrian refugee crisis seem tiny
* prime conditions for disease epidemics
* increased power for nationalists and authoritarians
* more radicalized ""lone wolf"" extremists

And of course all of these factors will create a positive feedback loop. More war creates more refugees. More border crises empower more nationalists. Nationalism increases xenophobia which spurs on more radicals, etc.


With all this in mind, shouldn't we all basically be training to be doomsday preppers? Climate change is barely an issue for most political campaigns and even things like the Paris Climate Accord seem woefully inadequate. 

It feels like a giant asteroid is heading for Earth. Half of us are debating whether the asteroid is just a hoax, 30% are oblivious to the asteroid's existence, 10% will like the ""Stop the Asteroid"" page on Facebook but will complain if their taxes are raised to fund an anti-asteroid missile, and 10% are screaming at everyone about the imminent doom that awaits but [go unheard](https://www.theonion.com/can-anyone-hear-me-shout-terrified-climate-scientist-1829652646).

Am I crazy? Does anyone else feel this way? The peace and stability I've taken for granted my whole life is on the brink of collapse. Why isn't this a major issue?! Every parent or person who desires kids (or plans to live for the next 40+ years) should be outraged that we're essentially doing nothing to prevent this. The people promoting climate change denialism should be treated like war criminals.

Over the years (and especially since 2016) I have noticed that my peers and colleagues have gotten much more intense and vocal about their beliefs, which is now causing a bit of a career crisis for me, because I work in an environment where I feel totally isolated and fear speaking my opinion for fear of blacklisting or being ""outed"", despite every theater in town claiming to be a 'safe space'. I worry that I have wasted my 20's building a resume that is useless in other sectors and that now I am going to have to start over from scratch.

Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and look into alternate career options or stick it out in hopes that the political climate will cool down? Not that I foresee that happening any time soon, unfortunately. I truly love the work and find creative fulfillment in it, but the people can just be so insufferable. I've yet to meet anyone in my field who openly claims to be conservative, although I know that there must be at least a few, statistically speaking.

"9s6g38","Conservative","unknown","18 examples of the spectacularly wrong predictions made around the first ""Earth Day"" in 1970, that have cost society BILLIONS. Government wants more power and will lie and scare you to achieve it."," 

1. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated in 1970 that **“civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”**
2. **“We   are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this   nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,”** wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.
3. The   day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page   warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely   to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable  deterioration  and possible extinction.”
4. “Population   will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in   food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April   1970 issue of Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least   100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the   next ten years.”
5. **“Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,”**   wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…\[1975\]   some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present   level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable   proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate   food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”
6. Ehrlich   sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue  of  The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4   billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the   “Great Die-Off.”
7. **“It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,”** declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.
8. Peter   Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970,   “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: **by   1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990   to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By   the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will   exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now,   the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America,   and Australia, will be in famine.”**
9. In   January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and   theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade,   urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…**by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”**
10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, **it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”**
11. Barry   Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all  of  the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to  suffocate.
12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting **in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.”** Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.
13. Paul   Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other   chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life   expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that **Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years,**   and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy   would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According   to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8  years).
14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, **“By   the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude   oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil.** You’ll drive up to the pump and say, Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say,  
I am very sorry, there isn’t any.’”
15. Harrison   Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a   chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and **estimated   the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead,   zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.**
16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that **in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”**
17. **In   1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the   original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the   next 30 years or so,** it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”
18. Kenneth   Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been   chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. **“If   present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder   for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in   the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an   ice age.”**

The  Arctic was supposed to be ice-free, hurricanes were going to be more  frequent and more deadly, and sea levels should be rising alarmingly.

Al Gore swore in his 2006 science fiction movie, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" that within a decade there would be **a ""true planetary emergency.""**

**""Unless  we act boldly and quickly to deal with the underlying causes of global  warming, our world will undergo a string of terrible catastrophes,""** said Gore in the movie's introduction.

The grand storyteller also predicted in 2011 that **""there will be no more snows""** on Mt. Kilimanjaro **""within the decade.""**

Four years earlier, the Guardian of Britain reported that the United  Nations was warning that we had **""as little as eight years left to avoid a  dangerous global average rise of 2C or more.""**  Three years and more than 1,000 days ago, then French Foreign Minister  Laurent Fabius — a  socialist, of course — advised us that **""we have 500 days to avoid  climate chaos.""**

We  could go on. But we have neither the space nor time to rack up all  the  missed global warming predictions. So we will merely point out that   instead of these disasters, we have the climate alarmist community  admitting that there has indeed been a pause in the warming and that its  models failed to predict it.

Yes, that's right. The alarmists are acknowledging in the abstract of a research paper that was published in [Nature Geoscience](https://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2973.html) that there have been **""differences in model and satellite tropospheric warming rates.""**

The study **""concluded  that Pruitt was wrong and many media outlets reported that conclusion.""  Will they be just as aggressive in reporting that Pruitt was right?**

Not a chance.

They  have been crying wolf for a long time. His former place of employment  was the center of the  first 'Climategate' scandal, in which hacked  emails showed that the  scientists were manipulating data that would  have undermined their global warming assertions,

# We've long known that at some point the confession had to be made.  The alarmists couldn't carry on the charade forever.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.
