"cyznyy","climatechange","action-oriented","Why is “global warming” our biggest focus environmentally?","To start, of course I understand global warming is real. (ETA I understand global warming is real and CATASTROPHIC. I am terrified about how we are destroying the planet and personally believe it will likely happen much faster than we are currently predicting). 

But for a while, I’ve struggled to shake the feeling that the term “global warming” and the focus we give it is being pushed to the forefront by the people who are the biggest offenders in the climate crisis. 

Before you shrug it off - the earth getting “warmer” is the only thing about ecological destruction that *doesn’t* cause immediate feelings of panic. There are plenty of people even on this sub that think the “earth will turn into a rainforest” and other ridiculous things if we keep emissions going at the rate they’re at now. 3-5*C makes me think there will be more sunny days, not the apocalypse. 

Why are we (people who believe in the preservation of the environment for the survival of humanity, if for no other reason) not focused on any of the more viscerally disturbing things that come along with climate change? They all seem like the bigger problems, and much more urgent (for lack of a better term) than the strict warming of the planet. 

- insecticide/pesticide/herbicide use & conventional ag destroying our pollinators and surrounding ecosystems 
- deforestation & development causing our water sources to dry up  
- pollution of waterways/groundwater/oceans from drilling/fracking/mining/oil spills/dirty development/ag runoff and waste mismanagement 
- pollution of our air with dirty energy generation 
- toxic chemicals pervasive in our everyday lives 
- impending collapse of wild food sources we rely on heavily to survive (ocean fish, for example) 

Any of the above seem to be way more compelling and open to far less debate/knee jerk skepticism than the hard to define, hard to “feel” (how many of us heard everyone complaining about how we “needed more global warming” during the winter cold spells?), and easy to reject/minimize “global warming.”


In short - is “global warming” a term pushed by oil companies, etc to cause us to get stuck in circular debates about the temperature while we pollute and destroy the ecosystems we rely on for survival?","2019-09-03 03:50:10","37","47","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cyznyy/why_is_global_warming_our_biggest_focus/","True","ntalwyr","1747930367.327092","climate crisis","manual"

Is my concern misplaced?","At the company I work at, one of our largest clients is the energy company Gazprom. According to the Climate Majors Report in 2017, only two companies in the world are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than Gazprom.

As I become more aware and knowledgable of the climate crisis, I feel increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that I am, indirectly, supporting the such a destructive business.

On the other hand, if it weren't Gazprom selling the energy, I suppose it would be someone else (since we currently have a system that relies on fossil fuels, and as long as the demand is there, someone will fulfil the supply).

I would be interest to hear others' thoughts on whether or not my guilt is misguided or naive.

"d0oag9","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I’m glad Trump got the USA out of the Paris climate accord, because it is a scam","The United States has done more to reduce emissions than any of the countries who stayed in the agreement. So we were signed up to spend trillions, potentially cripple our economy and sacrifice some of our sovereignty (I can see how this might not matter to people who think the U.S. is  nothing special, but that’s a discussion for another time) for what exactly?   


One of my classmates told me today that this was proof that Trump doesn’t care about or even believe in climate change. What a load of bullshit. But sadly, there’s a lot of people that still buy into it. 

And then we have the green new deal. There’s just no way. But supposing it was possible to implement it, it wouldn’t even have that much of an impact in global terms unless most of the world follows it or something similar. And we all know for damn sure that will never happen.  All this to say, America is not the problem. It’s India and China with their reckless desire for growth that is presently causing issues. Talk about a resource crisis caused by a booming population, it’s almost totally their fault. But noooooooo, everyone likes to hate on America. 

China’s explicit goal is to overtake us to become the next superpower, and they don’t really seem to care how they do it, short of avoiding war. Think what you will about America, id much rather have them in charge than China. But instead, we would essentially castrate ourselves while our biggest rival, and the number one cause of global warming, basically takes everything over, what’s best for everyone else be dammed. If that sounds extreme, just look at the news. That’s exactly what they’re doing.

"czfp34","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I (teen male) am scared for my future.","Now that I have gotten older, I have realized three things that started to fear as a teenager.
1: global warming
2: people’s response to my overintrovertedness 
3: unfairness to men. (Don’t flame me, let me explain first)

1: as a teenager with his whole life ahead of him,  I am afraid of the effects of climate change. I will not be able to grow old or have a family because of how bad everything is screwed up. The climate crisis keeps getting worse and no one will change it, and my generation is left with the consequences. 

2: the idea that video games are causing violence is ridiculous. I am straight A’s in high school with many AP classes. I’m not violent or anything like that and I’m usually more on the peaceful/introverted side of things. I think this idea has caused others to be scared of people who play many video games.

3) the unfair against men seems wrong. We should have total equality. Look at the custody court/divorce court, the draft, incarceration time. I don’t like these statistics. Then the idea where men cannot be raped is total bs. I personally have not, but I’m afraid of the idea that I try to defend myself, then I am the one who is to blame. I remember reading one of these earlier about the guy being raped and it made me fear problems like this. Also the case where the boy was arrested on fake sexual assault charges because the girls didn’t like him. (They later got away with no charges, which is honestly the biggest thing of BS I’ve seen yet.) I’m afraid that it can and will happen to me and I’ll become paranoid and record my entire life.

I am just afraid of the future that others have set for me even though I had no say. I am afraid for how screwed I am as a person because of my gender and my generation.

Thank you for listening to me. I hope most people would understand me.

"d79usz","vegan","unknown","Climate Change and Veganism","**Introduction**

Climate change, despite still being denied by many, is a well established theory with overwhelming evidence to support it. Climate scientists have been warning governments around the world for decades to take necessary steps to reduce global carbon emissions to avoid climate catastrophe, but so far not enough has been done to combat this major problem.

&#x200B;

**Effects of climate change**

The destabilisation of the climate negatively impacts just about every area of life. Below are three areas of life that are being impacted due to climate change:

**1) Ecosystems**

* **Erosion of the coral reef** \- “experts project that 90% of the world’s reefs will be gone by 2050. Coral reefs are among the earth’s most precious natural resources. They harbor a million species and provide food for 500 million people around the world. But warming waters, pollution and overfishing have badly damaged these precious ecosystems; roughly 50 percent of the world’s corals have been lost in just the last 30 years. [http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/](http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/)
* **Species extinction** \- “Human-caused climate change appears to have driven the Great Barrier Reef’s only endemic mammal species into the history books, with the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lives on a tiny island in the eastern Torres Strait, being completely wiped-out from its only known location. It is also the first recorded extinction of a mammal anywhere in the world thought to be primarily due to human-caused climate change.” [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change)
* **Toxic red tide** \- ""Florida is having a 10-month streak of toxic red tide. This so-called red tide has killed hordes of marine animals and is entering its 10th month of existence—making it one of the longest-lasting cases documented to date...According to Glibert, there are two key factors contributing to this worldwide shift: increasing nutrient run-off from farms, lawns, and other land-based sources, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns occurring as a result of climate change. [https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632) 

**2) Social**

* **Water** **shortages**: ""Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought in many parts of the United States and the world in the decades ahead."" [https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/](https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/)
* **Increased** **nutrient** **deficiency**: “**Climate** **change** will make hundreds of millions more people nutrient deficient. Crops grown in a high CO2 atmosphere are less nutritious, containing less protein, zinc and iron” [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient)
* **Increased** **risk** **of** **diseases**: “After West Nile virus kills 22 people in heatwave, experts warn of more mosquito and tick-borne diseases due to climate change...“ [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise)

**3) Energy**

* **Wind** **turbines** \- “Heatwave knocks wind out of onshore turbines” [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp)
* **Hydropower** **dams** \- ""African nations could face devastating blackouts as rising temperatures dry up their hydropower dams. Based on recent years in which extremely dry conditions saw electricity drop off in large areas, a new report by climate scientists has warned that the trend for dam construction may be misguided.” [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html)
* **Nuclear** **power** \- ""Europe’s heatwave, however, hasn’t just increased air temperatures but also water temperatures. Regulations protecting wildlife mean that the usual water sources drawn on by nuclear plants cannot always be used for cooling, leading to shutdowns. It’s not the first time this has happened: Heatwaves forced nuclear shutdowns or curtailments across Europe in 2003, 2006, and 2015. Worse still, scientists warn that thermal power interruptions will worsen because of climate change—not just because of heatwaves but also droughts. It’s ironic that human-induced climate change is threatening a climate-friendly source of electricity.

**How can veganism help**

There are many things an individual can do to reduce their carbon footprint, including: have fewer or no children, recycle more, walk, cycle and use public transport more, use automobiles and planes less, use less electricity, and educate others.  
One of the best ways, that is often not talked about, is to go vegan and switch to a plant-based diet.

>“Which diet is best for the environment? **According to the most comprehensive analysis of farming’s impact on the planet, plant-based food is most effective at combatting climate change**. Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, who led the study, said adopting a vegan diet is “the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth...""

**1) Less water use**

[https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable](https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable)

* About one-third of the world’s water consumption is for producing animal products.
* According to data from the Pacific Institute and National Geographic, a single egg takes 53 gallons of water to produce, a pound of chicken 468 gallons, a gallon of cow’s milk 880 gallons, and a pound of beef 1,800 gallons.
* Growing crops to feed animals killed for food consumes 56 percent of water in the U.S.
* Animal agriculture is responsible for 20 to 33 percent of all fresh water consumption in the world.
* Because animals are so densely packed on today's industrial farms, they produce more manure than can be absorbed by the land as fertilizer. The runoff from these facilities grossly contaminates rivers and ground water.
* Tyson, America’s largest meat producer, is responsible for dumping more toxic pollutants into our waterways than companies like ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical.
* Animal excrement and agricultural runoff have polluted nearly one-third of rivers in the U.S.
* One hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce—the equivalent of two months’ worth of showers.
* A pound of chicken requires 71 percent more water to produce than a pound of soy.

**2) Less pollution**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock operations on land have created more than 500 nitrogen flooded deadzones around the world in our oceans. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of ocean dead zones…water pollution. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**3) Less environmental destruction**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* The meat industry is the cause of 85% of all soil erosion. [https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/)

**4) Less species extinction**

* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction…and habitat destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Up to 137 plant, animal and insect species are lost every day due to rainforest destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**5) Less energy waste**

* “In general, each trophic level relates to the one below it by absorbing some of the energy it consumes, and in this way can be regarded as resting on, or supported by, the next lower trophic level. Food chains can be diagrammed to illustrate the amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to the next in a food chain. This is called an energy pyramid. The energy transferred between levels can also be thought of as approximating to a transfer in biomass, so energy pyramids can also be viewed as biomass pyramids, picturing the amount of biomass that results at higher levels from biomass consumed at lower levels. However, when primary producers grow rapidly and are consumed rapidly, the biomass at any one moment may be low; for example, phytoplankton (producer) biomass can be low compared to the zooplankton (consumer) biomass in the same area of ocean” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic\_level#Biomass\_transfer\_efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level#Biomass_transfer_efficiency)
* “Th**e ten percent law** of transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next can be attributed to Raymond Lindeman (1942), although Lindeman did not call it a ""law"" and cited ecological efficiencies ranging from 0.1% to 37.5%. According to this law, during the transfer of organic food energy from one trophic level to the next higher level, only about ten percent of the transferred energy is stored as flesh. The remaining is lost during transfer, broken down in respiration, or lost to incomplete digestion by higher trophic level.” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological\_efficiency#Ten\_percent\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_efficiency#Ten_percent_law)

&#x200B;

**Summary**

Climate change is real, human activity has been proven to be a major cause, and there are several things you can do to reduce its impact:

1) Have fewer or no children

2) Recycle more

3) Walk, cycle and use public transport more, and use automobiles and planes less

4) Switch to a plant-based diet

5) Use less electricity

6) Educate others

They need some type of great evil to fight against (Satan or the destruction of the planet or whatever).
