The International Energy Agency (IEA)  says solar will drive faster than forecasted growth in renewable energy.

"dg4y90","environmental_science","unknown","Plant a tree - save the planet?","So according to climate scientists if we planted billions of trees it would remove two- thirds of emissions from the atmosphere- hence solving the climate crisis. So there’s nearly 8 billion people in the world (I think?) if each person planted 1 tree (say in their garden or in a field or whatever) then that would solve it? So I’m guessing if we all did this we wouldn’t have to wait for those arsehole tory/ republican money grabbing climate change denying arseholes (yes I did say arsehole twice) to pull their fingers out of their - you guessed it - arseholes, and we could solve the problem ourselves?.. am I being stupid or is this a solution where we can literally take matters into our own hands and the Trumps and Boris’s can go fuck themselves. Oh no I just read it down there that individuals can help by planting their own trees... there you have it.. I’m gonna plant one tomorrow. Fuck. You.

"dcboxi","vegan","unknown","The people denying climate change are crazy","Okay this is bothering me why do so many people deny the crisis of our climate despite all the science, the obvious change that's happening, the burning rain forests, animals going extinct, more and more land being taken over for animal agriculture, people starving and dying when most available food goes to livestock just for way fewer developed entitled populations to have their meat and animal products because *gasp* they taste nice.
I have been so angry recently and I don't want to be because it sucks but how can you not be?
Trying to be nice when people continue to ignore and destroy the planet that we have to share is just impossible at this point.
Like yes hello some Vegans are crazy but can you blame us when we are constantly surrounded by corpses and people acting like it's all perfectly great. Maybe we are the sane ones for being outraged at the treatment of other beings whom share this planet with us, and having to share in the consequences of your actions. Whilst you destroy our planet and call us the bad guy.

"dghn2t","urbanplanning","unknown","Engineering Intentionally Terrible Transit: A Critique of Southeast Michigan’s 2020-2045 RTA proposal Pt. 1: How Bad is it?","# Disclaimer:

*This is part one of a three part series analyzing a local transit proposal that is likely to hit ballot boxes next year in my local area. This entry looks at the past history of transit in Southeast Michigan and compares it to the scope and scale of the Southeast Michigan Regional Transit Authority’s proposed “2045 vision” plan. My next entry will deal with what improvements can be made in order to avoid defeat at the ballot box, and the final entry will concern what types of political reforms would need to happen in order to assure the speedy and efficient delivery of a world class regional transit system to the Detroit Metro Area, as well as theorize about the future development of cities in general.*

Comprehensive regional transit has been at the tip of every single person’s tongue in the Detroit Metro Area and Greater Southeast Michigan region for decades now, which makes perfect sense once you consider the fact that [a 2019 WalletHub study ranked Detroit and its surrounding areas as literally the worst place to own a car in the entire nation](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-to-drive-in/13964/) due to the absolutely insane cost of insurance, car maintenance, and the overall condition of transportation infrastructure in the state of Michigan (Fun Fact: our roads are so trash that, in 2018 we elected a governor whose main platform was literally just [“We need to fix the damn roads”](http://youtube.com/watch?v=mjVJ5XoYKEA) and added a threat of vowing to completely veto any budget passed by the state legislature that didn’t include any long-term road funding. This promise which, unsurprising to anyone who has a passing curiosity in state politics, [was waffled on immediately after she got into office](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/09/09/whitmer-breaks-pledge-to-fix-the-damn-roads-under-new-budget)).

There’s something interesting about our demoralizing current lack of transit though: it didn’t always use to be like this. At its height in 1910, Michigan possessed over nine thousand miles of freight and regional/commuter rail, which is enough rail mileage to build a rail route from Detroit to the northernmost city in Michigan’s lower peninsula (Mackinaw City) thirty five times or, a rail line from NYC’s Grand Central Terminal to Michigan Central Station eighteen times. For reference, these cities are about 252 and 484 miles apart from Detroit respectively, [here’s a timeline compiled by the Michigan Department of Transit documenting the rise and fall of Michigan’s railways](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdot/Michigan_Railroad_History_506899_7.pdf) read it. It’s eye opening. Even in decades of stagnation and decline in the seventies and eighties, it was possible to catch [commuter trains from downtown Detroit to Jackson, Michigan and through to Chicago to the west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Executive) and [from the Renaissance Center on Detroit’s riverfront up to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac in the north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEMTA_Commuter_Rail).

So, just how in the hell does a major American city and a heavily developed state/region  allow it’s public infrastructure to deteriorate as drastically as it did? If you want the short, snarky yet completely true left-urbanist answer: It was because of capitalism, aduhh. If you a longer, more “objective” answer (that still relates to capitalism, but phrased in a way that allows people who are fans of “market urbanism” to not get too worked up):[ it happened for all the same reasons that the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WORIrHpC8M), private companies that live and die by their ability to endlessly expand their profits and have a vested interest in maintaining/expanding their business models will always seek to co-opt and undermine public goods if they threaten to compete with or undermine those same profits and business interests. It was true in 1920, and if left unchanged by the public it will remain the truth into 2020.

So, you may be thinking this post is informative so far and all. But, how does all of this relate to a transit proposal? Simply put, as a lifelong resident of this region, when I look at this proposal, which at first glance seems like one of the most ambitious transit plans this region’s history, is not up to snuff once you dive deeper into the details of all of the aspects that make up this proposal, nor does it learn from the state’s past mistakes of allowing privatization to take root within public assets, and that isn’t even nearly half of it. The RTA’s projections of job opportunities and lifestyles for the region’s young people like myself are hilariously bleak. It makes absolutely no effort to address or confront the fast approaching climate crisis that has to be tackled immediately if we want future generations to enjoy life on the only habitable planet that Humans have ever known. The RTA focuses on “connecting existing population and job centers” rather than striving to build and maintain new ones like the rail+property model that has been successfully deployed in cities across Asia. etc. Did I mention that it’s literally a giveaway to car and “mobility” companies? Yeah, well it’s that too.

Let’s take a dive into the proposal to see what specifically is so bad about it (trust me, there’s a lot, but I only wanna cover the big issues for the time being) [here’s a direct link to the proposal so you can read it and judge it’s merits for yourselves](http://www.rtamichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/8-2020.Mobility.Vision.Presentation.7.18.19.pdf)

# Bright predictions for a bullshit future

On the portion of the document that’s titled “The Region Today”, the RTA’s projections of population and job growth is a bit… iffy to say the least. Assuming that this transit plan is passed by voters next year, the RTA projects that the largest metro area in the state of Michigan will grow from 4.2 million to 4.5 million people, and the job market will grow from 2.5 million to 2.7 million jobs over the span of twenty years (2020-2045). If you extrapolate those figures to yearly growth percentages, they’re expecting a change of .012%/year and .008%/year respectively… If those figures don’t concern you, then I’d like to direct your attention to the bottom of the page where the RTA constructed a chart comparing the composition of the region’s population in 2015 to the projected composition of the region in 2045. If you want a lesson in how you can hide extremely unfavorable data in plain sight, look no further than this chart. While the senior population is projected to rise by a “mere” 7% and the youth population is projected to decline “only” 2% if you extrapolate this data to actual population figures, the estimated shift is absolutely jaw dropping: The senior population is expected to rise by 990,000 people while the youth population is expected to drop by 84,000 people.. To put that youth figure into proper context, [between the years of 2008 and 2012 the entire state of Michigan lost 17,208 young people with bachelor’s degrees per year](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2019/03/michigan-still-fights-brain-drain-although-outlook-has-improved.html), that 84k loss figure for the Detroit area is 22% larger than the losses for those four years combined.. Keep in mind that these are likely the “most optimistic” numbers that the RTA are projecting. Michigan has been a struggling state for a long time.

# A lack of care for the climate

The word “electric” is only used twice within a twenty eight page document describing a major municipal transit proposal, and only used when referring to the “aspirational goals”.... That’s a major problem. [The vast majority of climate scientists agree that if action isn’t taken within 12-11 years,  Earth will experience irreversible warming the likes of which this planet has never seen](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/27082019/12-years-climate-change-explained-ipcc-science-solutions). The fact that there aren’t any aggressive goals or benchmarks in place to meet tackle an issue of monumental importance like climate change, (refusing even to reference the words “climate change” a single time in the whole document no less) and the blatant admission on “The Region Today” page at the beginning of the document that the transit proposal does not aim to reduce overall car usage in the DMA, or increase the total percentage of low car and car-free households over the twenty five year lifespan of this proposal should put doubts in anyone’s minds that the RTA takes its job as a provider of public transit seriously.

# Artificially restricted and rickety rail numbers

The main backbone of the concrete promises in this transit proposal rely heavily on expanded local bus services, the promise of BRT lines on the region’s major thoroughfares, and just one commuter rail line.. that’s it. [Extensive research has already been done about the social and physical benefits that people may enjoy by simply living near rail transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cjfTG8DbwA&t=72s). The RTA might have included a few more commuter rail lines, light rail to the airport, and a promise to expand the Qline (A public-private financed streetcar that runs through downtown Detroit which was constructed with the unwanted influence of the state’s richest man Dan Gilbert, which is why the streetcar is named after his company Quicken Loans. [He oversaw a series of boneheaded design changes that lead the streetcar to drastically underperform it’s projected ridership projections](https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/two-years-in-detroits-qline-falls-far-short-of-expectations/Content?oid=21552552)) in their “aspirational goals” but like a lot of things in this proposal, upon a closer look, the numbers just don’t seem to add up. In the “Rail” portion of the document, the RTA states that $135 million dollars is needed in order to establish the Ann Arbor-Detroit commuter rail line, but, when the RTA calculates the cost of expanding the commuter rail  north to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac and northwest to the suburb of Mount Clements, *plus* building a new streetcar line to the airport, *plus* an unspecified expansion of the Qline downtown, they estimate the cost to only be $181 million dollar more per year… what? That‘s the type of math that I do when I don’t feel like working on an assignment until I find myself awake at 11:00 pm with a 12 o’clock deadline to turn in a paper to my professor.. It makes no sense.

#Finally: Crazy cash for car and mobility companies

References to explicit privatization of formerly public transit services and “public private partnerships” are peppered through this document more vigorously than a Cajun gumbo dish. Knowing the history of transit in this city and state as well as I do, I am more than a little freaked out when I see passages like: *“the evaluation of underperforming routes regularly and pilot alternative forms of mobility (i.e. microtransit, public private partnerships service models, etc.) is an aspirational goal of ours”* and *“Expanding public/private pilot programs to evaluate new service models is something that we want to do in the near term”* (which can be found in the “local bus”  and “new mobility services” portions of the document respectively) take up prime real estate on a document regarding a long term transit proposal. If you want to deal with solid numbers, if you add up all of the near term/long term goals where some form of privatization or public-private partnerships are mentioned, for profit companies would have access to $1.31 billion public dollars by the proposal’s end in 2045 (this amounts to $52.4 million/year).

If that isn’t unpalletable enough, there’s ample evidence here that there were some closed door deals made between public and private officials. Take Michigan Central Station (MCS), which is Ford’s new Corktown campus, it makes a not-so-strange cameo appearance in this plan. [It was announced on June 11th of last year that they bought the long abandoned landmark from a local family of notorious slumlords named the Moroun’s](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2018/06/11/moroun-detroit-train-station-ford/689841002/), who then proceeded to wax poetic about Ford’s “commitment to the future of Detroit” and all that PR fluff. Then, [a story broke on April 3rd of this year suggesting that representatives from Ford Co. approached members of Detroit/Wayne county’s port authority, officials in the Detroit mayor’s office, Congresswoman Brenda Jones of Southfield, and “other regional and transit officials” asking them to conduct a feasibility study to see if passenger rail service could be restored at the site](https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/detroit-studies-restoring-passenger-trains-michigan-central-station). Now, it might seem like a completely innocent, altruistic act for Ford to do at first glance. Detroit and southeast Michigan haven’t had a true regional rail network since the early eighties. But, once you consider the fact that, after the process of buying MCS was all said and done, [Ford secured $104 million dollars in tax breaks from Detroit](http://freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/10/16/ford-michigan-central-station-tax/1651079002/), which is America’s largest impoverished city population and percentage wise and [got a further $207 million from the state of Michigan](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/john-gallagher/2018/11/27/detroit-train-station-ford-corktown/2127091002/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) which has been experiencing a cataclysmic teacher shortage in its urban and rural schools (which won’t be helped by the fact that there are stipulations in these tax breaks that allow Ford to have the value of their property frozen to “pre-improvement” levels for 12-15 years, and they are exempted from paying city property, corporate, and utility taxes for 30 years. To put this into context, I was born in 1997, I’ll be 53 years old by the time Ford is legally obligated to pay the full cost of their new property). Nevermind the fact that, literally a couple months after the deal was finalized,[ they laid off 800 local workers for “reorgination purposes”](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/05/20/state-taxpayers-gave-ford-240m-then-it-cut-800-local-jobs) ,  [they owed the federal government $78 million in unpaid taxes as of last year](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/02/28/gm-ford-rarely-pay-federal-taxes-tax-refunds/2985737002/), and even though they moved  into Corktown in a completely transparent bid to try and capitalize off yet to be discussed transit proposal as well as flex their muscles as a “mobility company”, [Ford discontinued their “Chariot” services that they piloted in major metro areas like New York and San Francisco in order to show investors that they could even be a “mobility company”](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/ford-is-shutting-down-chariot-shuttle-service/)... there’s a whole portion of the transit proposal dedicated to this type of business model, and local “leaders” in the area thought that it was a good idea to do this..

I had already gotten a warning to get detained from my institution when teacher heard me talking about clatherate gun event (last year)

Hey listen, I too want to be like Greta but the difference is that while she got all the money, media and big people rolling around her due to being from a rich family with good connections HERE I AM trying to arrange money for my next meal. Give me about 10mil so that I won't have to worry about basic survival of me and my family and I'll go and personally stab those rich oil lobbyists.

I go along with the wheel I'll collapse next decade. I try to play Greta and I'll collapse tomorrow.

Also environmental collapse is getting mainstream because it has started making money now not because of some 16 year old girl. It is getting stronger because now owners of green tech like solar, nuclear are also lobbying against oil giants. Corporates are shifting towards renewables because oil is drying up. Its now businessmen vs businessmen.

Heck we have known about environmental crisis from 1950s. Thousands of scientists and activists were warning us since then and many have been 'Episteined' over it. I find mindlessly echoing 'A brave teen who alone shook the world in a matter of days and everyone should be like her' insulting to those who actually did work in this field and sacrificed their life for it.

I do what I can

I don't have a fuel based vehicle. I own a manual cycle and I use public transport for long distances

I have stopped single used plastics now. Why now shills will ask, because only now shopkeepers have stopped giving things in them. I never bought one plastic bag. I was just using what came with shopping.

I don't have an ac. I have a desert cooler.

I'm  vegetarian 

I have a veg garden

I have solar

I'm getting skills

I'm telling people I know about upcoming collapse. But not by crying out loud , by having a proper discussion with them. Yes they argue at first but when shown facts, graphs, bunkers rich people are making, sea ice conditions etc I can proudly say that I've turned 3 out of 13-15 people I've talked to into reducing their carbon footprint. They still use car for office commute but not anymore for shopping, nightouts etc. They don't waste potable water anymore, don't throw litter anymore etc.

And other things which I CAN DO. But don't expect me to do something out of my pay grade.","2019-10-05 13:06:14","82","151","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ddn0rd/im_fed_up_with_greta_worshipping_and_people/","True","cooltechpec","1747932966.780946","climate crisis","manual"
