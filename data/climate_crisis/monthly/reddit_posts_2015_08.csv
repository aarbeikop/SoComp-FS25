I’m Jim Hansen, a professor at [Columbia University’s Earth Institute]( http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9).<http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9> I'm  joined today by 3 colleagues who are scientists representing different aspects of climate science and coauthors on papers we'll be talking about on this AMA.

--Paul Hearty, paleoecologist and professor at University of North Carolina at Wilmington, NC Dept. of Environmental Studies. “I study the geology of sea-level changes”

--George Tselioudis, of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies; “I head a research team that analyzes observations and model simulations to investigate cloud, radiation, and precipitation changes with climate and the resulting radiative feedbacks.”

--Pushker Kharecha from Columbia University Earth Institute; “I study the global carbon cycle; the exchange of carbon in its various forms among the different components of the climate system --atmosphere, land, and ocean.”

Today we make the case for urgent action to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are on the verge of locking in highly undesirable consequences, leaving young people with a climate system out of humanity's control. Not long after my 1988 testimony to Congress, when I concluded that human-made climate change had begun, practically all nations agreed in a 1992 United Nations Framework Convention to reduce emissions so as to avoid dangerous human-made climate change.  Yet little has been done to achieve that objective.

I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss with researchers and general science readers here on redditscience an alarming situation — as the science reveals climate threats that are increasingly alarming, policymakers propose only ineffectual actions while allowing continued development of fossil fuels that will certainly cause disastrous consequences for today's young people. Young people need to understand this situation and stand up for their rights.

To further a broad exchange of views on the implications of this research, my colleagues and I have published in a variety of open access journals, including, in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648),
[PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648), and most recently, [Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from the Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling that 2 C Global Warming is Highly Dangerous](http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/2015/20150704_IceMelt.pdf), in [Atmos. Chem. & Phys. Discussions](http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/volumes_and_issues.html) (July, 2015).

One conclusion we share in the latter paper is that ice sheet models that guided [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](http://www.ipcc.ch/) sea level projections and upcoming United Nations meetings in Paris are far too sluggish compared with the magnitude and speed of sea level changes in the paleoclimate record. An implication is that continued high emissions likely would result in multi-meter sea level rise this century and lock in continued ice sheet disintegration such that building cities or rebuilding cities on coast lines would become foolish.

The bottom line message we as scientists should deliver to the public and to policymakers is that we have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical. We conclude and reaffirm in our present paper that the crisis calls for an across-the-board rising carbon fee and international technical cooperation in carbon-free technologies. This urgent science must become part of a global conversation about our changing climate and what all citizens can do to make the world livable for future generations.

Joining me is my co-author, Professor Paul Hearty, a professor at University of North Carolina — Wilmington.

How important should they be?","Whether it's [John McCain not knowing how many homes he owns](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12685.html) in 2008 amidst the large number of foreclosures from the housing crisis or [Mitt Romney's ""47% of Americans...believe they are victims"" comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2gvY2wqI7M) in 2012, gaffes rise and fall in media coverage all the time, but many seem to play significant roles in a candidate's popular opinion, particularly towards the end of an election season. Whether coverage of gaffes tends to focus more on Republicans more or if Republicans make more gaffes is certainly debatable.

Many Republican candidates in this campaign season have had major gaffes of their own:

* Ted Cruz's [""Net Neutrality"" is Obamacare for the Internet](https://twitter.com/sentedcruz/status/531834493922189313), [Comparing Climate Change to Flat-Earthers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/25/ted-cruz-compares-climate-change-activists-to-flat-earthers-where-to-begin/), or his very inappropriately-timed [Joe Biden joke](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/ted-cruz-mocks-joe-biden-then-rapidly-apologizes-118620.html)

* Mike Huckabee's [transgendered shower comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-CX3swUdjo)

* Donald Trump's (far too many to list)

* Ben Carson's comments on [gay being a choice](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ben-carson-gay-choice-prison-115744.html) and [comparison of the U.S. to Nazi Germany](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/03/politics/carson-stands-by-nazi-germany-comparsion/).

* Scott Walker's [comparison of Wisconsin protestors to ISIS](http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/414512/scott-walkers-awful-answer-isis)

* Rand Paul's [Baltimore comment: ""I came through the train on Baltimore last night. I’m glad the train didn’t stop.""](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/how-rand-paul-blew-it-on-baltimore-117538.html)

And the Democrats:

* Hillary Clinton's [dead broke comment](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/)

* Joe Biden's [list of gaffes](http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nbcnews-com/a-brief-history-of-joe-biden-gaffes-337489987777)

Note: I don't intend for this to be a complete list.

Several Republicans candidates have cough up gaffes to being ""too sensitive"" or ""too politically correct"", so my questions are: **How important are candidates' gaffes to you for deciding your vote? How important should they be?** Do these gaffes give insight into how a candidate thinks? Or are these more slips of the tongue and things we should just ignore?","2015-08-20 01:13:06","0","5","0.43","https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3hnte3/how_important_are_candidates_gaffes_to_you_how/","True","iliveintexas","1747860017.857174","climate crisis","manual"
"3i8hqt","vegan","unknown","Climate change is a vegan issue.","Veganism and climate change are inextricably intertwined with one another.  Advocating for one is advocating for the other because: 

1. Animal agriculture is one of the most deleterious industries with respect to the environment:
	a. Greenhouse gas emissions (18% of anthropogenic CO_2e).
	b. Deforestation leading to habitat destruction which threatens biodiversity and leads to more GHG emissions.
	c. Spoiling of the land and waterways with disgusting waste byproducts.

2. Climate change doesn't just affect humans but rather all life on Earth, non-human animals included.  The potential downside of climate change is the end of pretty much all life on Earth which would only occur at the end of some fairly cataclysmic suffering. 

Speaking for myself, though I am rationally aware of this intersectionality, there is some degree of compartmentalization that happens.  This is because even if there wasn't impending climate doom, there are separate arguments which favor veganism -- in fact, these ethical arguments were my primary motivation for becoming vegan in the first place. So reasoning about veganism is different from reasoning about climate change for me.  

But this compartmentalization is wrong!  These two issues intersect in so many ways and I think the vegan movement, such as it is, needs to bring this into greater public awareness.  

[Here is an interview with activist Naomi Klein.](http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/25302/1/the-activists-at-the-frontlines-of-climate-change)  And here is a quote from the interviewer:

>And yet, as author, activist and global intellectual Naomi Klein says in her new book This Changes Everything, climate change is also an opportunity. It’s a chance to unify all of those diverse global struggles – battles against austerity, racism, fracking, drilling for oil in the Arctic, and much, much more – that are being fought in courts and governments, on the streets, the high seas, and online.  “The environmental crisis isn’t separate from political and economic crises,” she points out, “it supercharges each one of them with existential urgency.”

Note animal ag is not mentioned, which is ludicrous.  I, anecdotally, notice this myopia within circles of climate advocates often and I find it bewildering.  

This brings me to the real reason why I wanted to post this: *I think vegans who care about animal rights would accomplish a lot by raising awareness of the ecological impacts of animal agriculture, and most especially within the community of climate activists.*  Put simply, unify.

My guess is that this would happen most efficiently if the vegan movement were to, itself, start vociferously waving the banner of climate activism.  Perhaps an organization of vegans who make both climate change and veganism issues front and center (I know of no such organization).

My rough impression of the state of the world is that appeals for behavioral change in service of the climate are much more well-received by people than veganism.  What I would like to see is veganism begin to become one of those appeals.  *I would like people to think of veganism as an environmental issue.* This helps the future of life on Earth, and so, doubly helps the animals we care about.

What do you think?
