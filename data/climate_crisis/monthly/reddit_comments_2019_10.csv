According to the amount of deforested land there currently is that is not being used for anything, we also have the space for that.","2019-10-10 23:05:00","4","letstalkwolves","1747932546.292963","climate crisis","manual"
"f3aavki","t3_dg4y90","dg4y90","environmental_science","unknown","If there were space for that many trees without changing our land use patterns, they'd have recruited already. We haven't just cut down trees for shits and giggles, we've cut them down in order to utilize that land for other purposes, mostly agriculture and pasture (but also suburbs, cities, industry, etc.). Trees are also not the right plants for every ecosystem, and sometimes you can do more damage by planting the wrong things than by just not planting anything at all.

The idea that we can just plant a bunch of trees to take care of climate change is overly simplistic, and the fact of the matter is that the carbon we've put into the atmosphere hasn't been part of it for millions of years. Even if we were to restore the world's forests to what they were during the Stone Age, there'd still be all the fossil fuel carbon we've dumped into the atmosphere.

Anyway, climate change is a systemic issue. To tackle it we need nothing short of a social upheaval or a technological miracle. Your personal choices really don't matter (which isn't to say you shouldn't try to be as green as you can be).","2019-10-11 04:02:01","4","salamander_salad","1747932546.294925","climate crisis","manual"
"f4i6xhu","t3_dg4y90","dg4y90","environmental_science","unknown","Just planting trees is not enough.  Many of the commercial tree plantations I know actually emit more green house gases than they sequester because natural vegetation is replaced by mono-cultures.

The trick is to store the carbon in soil in the form of humus (or soil organic matter) which consists mostly of carbon.  Grass or annual plants can be more effective at sequestering carbon than trees. It all depends on the land management. 

It's important to understand that fungi play an important role in storing carbon in soil. The greater the variety and number of mushrooms you find in a forest, the greater the soil's ability to store carbon.","2019-10-20 19:44:30","1","New-Atlantis","1747932546.296469","climate crisis","manual"

And as an aside: This is the key understanding the climate change debate is:

**Only [100 companies are the source of more than 70% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change)**

The real culprits in climate change are corporations, not individuals. The whole climate denier vs ""individual don't do enough"" is how PTB have successfull framed the debate. And it's bunk. They use propaganda to make liberals feel guilty about their carbon footprint and to convince conservatives to fight against environmental protections that would cut into their profits. The powerful have famed the debate so they are cleverly out of the equation, while we are distracted fighting each other.","2019-10-05 13:24:53","51","big-galloot","1747932967.8047118","climate crisis","manual"
