"dkavesn","t3_6nnjy7","6nnjy7","futurology","unknown","As long as the atmosphere inside the dome and outside remained at the same pressure, yeah, it could be done.

However, reversing climate change would probably be easier. The limitation is not technical feasibility, but the political and economic will to do it.

Also, even if you did seal everybody into giant domes, there remains the question of how to grow food for all those people, and how to make sure the climate inside the dome doesn't get even worse than the climate outside. It's not really a viable solution.","2017-07-16 19:16:08","2","green_meklar","1747894570.454755","climate crisis","manual"

I think it's safe to say that climate is not static and unchanging. Beyond that, you don't really know what's in store for us in the future.  IT could be be warmer with lots of crazy weather, death falling from the sky, famine, floods, the end of civilization as we know it.  Or, it could be a little warmer, but lush, with lots of life-giving rain and abundant crops.  Civilization could improve to the point where we don't have illiterate idiots breeding like rabbits, where education is universal and where people realize the benefits of having one child instead of 5, or even not having children at all.  We could see the population naturally fall to a stable, easily sustained number.

>So, could we just put us all into completely self-dependent biodomes before the crisis reaches it's peak?

What crisis, exactly?  Do you even know what has you afraid?  We're talking about having a global increase in temperature, but what does that mean on a local climate.  Is Greenland a better place to live than Miami is today?  Miami is warmer, therefore worse, right?   Would England be a worse place to live if the winters there were 3 degrees warmer than they are now?  Why?  What horrors await people when you have to use less fuel to keep from freezing to death ever winter?

Scare mongering has convinced an entire generation that a warmer world is terrifying, and that more CO2 means less food.  They forget to mention that the theory says that the poles will warm faster than the temperate zones, and the temperate zones will warm more than the tropics.  This means that if we see 2 degrees of warming in the high latitudes, we'll see 1 in the tropics and maybe half a degree in the equatorial regions.

Ever been to the tropics?  Notice how everyone claims that the tropics are the closest thing to Hell on Earth.  No, wait, that's not right. No, they are compared to Paradise, not hell.  I would hate it if more of the planet becomes more like paradise.

Yep, you should definitely seek out a sealed bio-dome and lock yourself away from the natural world - so that you don't have to deal with the horrors of Jamaica or Fiji. We wouldn't want that.","2017-07-16 18:08:34","0","deck_hand","1747894570.467511","climate crisis","manual"
