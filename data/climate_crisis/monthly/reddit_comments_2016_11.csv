"d9tdzbb","t3_5byi0k","5byi0k","environment","emotional","Well, since I'm trawling r/all today, and you don't actually seem to have a right wing position in your sub, I figure I'll give my two cents.

>We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

You might get the first if you're willing to support nuclear.  You won't get the second, and you probably won't get the third unless you can come up with something that doesn't expressly penalize America and Americans unnecessarily.  

In this thread, I see things like ""it's a sad day for science"" and ""they don't care about public health"", and it's that kind of blind, smug hypocrisy that won Trump the election in the first place.  If you want to get along, you need to get on board with a few attitude adjustments.

You do NOT have a monopoly on ""science"", first of all.  Science is not men in lab coats agreeing with one another(by the way, the average Joe is smart enough to realize that when you talk about ""consensus"", you're not pushing science you're pushing democracy masked as science), science is not popularization of your beliefs, and science is not something you can use to bludgeon away disagreement, science is a process to follow.  You all talk about it like it's your religion, and to be frank to a lot of people that is off putting.

If you want to make inroads with the Trump camp, you need to understand that we believe ""better here than there"" when it comes to manufacturing.  We believe that manufacturing is better off in the United States following our regulations, than in China following no regulations.  We want to get jobs back and make new ones, and all too often I see environmentalists pooh poohing the damage they have done to the American economy and to the American blue collar worker.  The left in general has this problem, an unmistakable contempt for the average person who just wants to feed his family.  

And lastly, you need to push nuclear.  To be frank, the right wing does not consider solar or wind to be viable options.  Both are highly dependent on favorable conditions to operate, and are unworkable in places like Alaska for example(I'm from Alaska, and they pushed wind a while back, but the turbines literally become inoperable in winter and have to be dismantled).  Nuclear means long term development(which is short term job growth for construction, and that means it creates blue and white collar jobs), it's long term sustainable, and modern nuclear facilities are safe and reliable.  

So, in summary.  Unlike your top post here, you don't have to just ""talk their language"" and not change a thing about your proposed policies.  That is coming at us with the assumption that we oppose you solely out of ignorance and stupidity.  

You probably won't see this since I'm 16 hours too late, but ah well.  ","2016-11-09 21:14:57","2","[deleted]","1747881822.518999","climate crisis","manual"

"d9gpweb","t3_5ait5i","5ait5i","conspiracy","unknown","It's an interesting theory.  I waffle between believing ""it's all planned"" to ""the people in charge are just flying by the seat of their pants.""  

Ultimately, though, I believe the answers have always, and will always, come down to money, and the accumulation of money in the short term ALWAYS overrides the plan for anything in the long term.  My thought is, can you tie your theory to the accumulation of wealth either now or in the future (but it's better if it's now)?  If so, then it's more likely than not to be true.

So, what I'm trying to think through is, the bankers who run things, mostly European, but increasingly now American too- how do they stand to lose or gain money when said sea level rise and subsequent displacement happen?  When you think through that, you know.  Because the western ""leaders"" that we see are not actually making the decisions.","2016-11-01 12:47:49","1","Uniqueusername121","1747882880.383744","climate crisis","manual"
