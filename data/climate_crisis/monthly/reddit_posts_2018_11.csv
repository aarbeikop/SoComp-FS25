As part of my university education, I'm attending a class which emphasizes making my discipline - psychology - useful and approachable for the common person who isn't acquainted with scientific jargon, has access to journals, etc. Essentially, we're trying to ""give psychology away"" by making it useful, transparent, and attainable to more than just other scientists. Part of that means working with other disciplines, and part of that means having a class blog (which apparently gets a lot of readers).

One of the students I work with wrote a small piece on environmental psychology and why there's a generational gap between those who care vs. don't care about the environment - something I'm sure many of us here have felt. The article helps establish why this occurs, and what can be done to help remedy it. I appreciate that the student I worked with was not afraid to call this environmental crisis what it is; already here, and long since an existential threat. Too much literature glosses over just how dire this really is...
