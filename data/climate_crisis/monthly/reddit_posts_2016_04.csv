"4gmsd1","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Based on his statement on 4/26, it appears Bernie is out to affect the party platform, not win the nomination going forward. What does this mean for the remaining primary states and corresponding fundraising?","""I congratulate Secretary Clinton on her victories tonight, and I look forward to issue-oriented campaigns in the 14 contests to come.

I am proud that we were able to win a resounding victory tonight in Rhode Island, the one state with an open primary where independents had a say in the outcome. Democrats should recognize that the ticket with the best chance of winning this November must attract support from independents as well as Democrats. I am proud of my campaign’s record in that regard.

The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be. That’s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast. That is why this campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform that calls for a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition free and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.""

"4f1n9j","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","What do you think about the views of Hillary and Bernie on the issue of Climate?","“Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency,” Bernie Sanders said. “We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances. There’s going to be international conflict.”
Clinton hit back that her plan was more realistic than Sanders’.
“I don’t think I’ve changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas,” Clinton said.
The argument for natural as a bridge fuel has been heavily criticized by environmentalists. The process of extraction, transporting, and storing natural gas has significant climate implications, as well. In fact, studies have suggested that the methane emissions associated with fracking for natural gas completely negate any climate benefit of using the “cleaner” fuel.
“I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy,” Clinton said.

Clinton did not respond to Sanders’ repeated allegations that she does not support a carbon tax, which the socialist-leaning Sanders has proposed.","2016-04-16 12:12:59","16","49","0.7","https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4f1n9j/what_do_you_think_about_the_views_of_hillary_and/","True","King_Andersons","1747872172.9012759","climate crisis","manual"
