Don't put houses and businesses in flood zones. Put parks, golf courses and other recreational areas in them, where if it floods it's no big deal.

"e3hjje8","t3_93q1s2","93q1s2","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","It won't change anything, because the changes themselves over the next 10 years will be too gradual. Climate change means a higher frequency of major weather events, but people who want to deny it will just say ""there has always been X kind of storms."" 

Also, people who oppose taking action and who live on the coast will likely blame the federal government for higher flood insurance rates or the inability to get loans, rather than the sober analysis of insurance companies. 

However - that's on the aggregate. If Florida starts getting pummeled with hurricane after hurricane with major storm surges that start decimating traditionally conservative areas, it will change some people's minds, and since a lot of US politics is real 50/50 these days, a good enough impact on some key swing states could change things near the end of that 10 year window.

I heard something yesterday, can't remember if it was on public radio or a podcast, so don't have a source, but the quote was something to the effect of, we've known about the problem, but even so have consumed more energy and produced more greenhouse gasses since 1979 than we did in all of human history before that time.

"e3ifwo7","t3_93q1s2","93q1s2","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Your post and most of the responses here are primarily discussing increased flooding and other adverse weather events, but the political effects of climate change are already being felt in the West with the dramatic uptick in the frequency and severity of wildfires. One thing that people from the East Coast might not realize is that the impacts of these fires aren't hyperlocal (it seems like national media coverage always focuses on evacuations and the occasional deaths of firefighters). The smoke from any single fire can blanket an entire region depending on the wind, and the drop in air quality to unsafe levels and lower visibility hits major cities just like the rural communities closer to the fires. If you've lived here for more than ten years and have a pulse then it's completely undeniable that something dramatic has changed.

I was doing forestry field work all over Eastern Oregon last season, and the fires were the only issue any of the locals could talk about. Some of that energy and anger is directed at the Forest Service for its policy to suppress all fires going back to the beginning of the 20th century, which loaded all the forests in the Intermountain West with the fuel that is making this run of fires so severe. There are numerous other ways that climate change is contributing to this annual disaster, but my point is that most people across the region have noticed that something is off, and politicians for statewide office have been running on issues related to the broader problem for two or more election cycles already.

The Forest Service and Park Service are already dedicating an absurd portion of their budgets to fighting these fires, to the exclusion of everything else. If you heard about Zinke's proposal from earlier this year to triple the entrance fees to certain National Parks: this is why. Without dramatically more federal funding, the only services our land management agencies can provide are firefighting and basic law enforcement within park boundaries.","2018-08-03 01:56:44","7","Buffalo_Danger","1747912211.637142","climate crisis","manual"

"e3mm759","t3_93q1s2","93q1s2","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Just a late add to this: There are major some economical impacts from a possible die-off in fish population (if not an eventual ecological collapse) on the western seaboard as glacier advance slows. I visited my home state of Alaska ~4 years ago, and had the good fortune in talking to a few scientists working in Seward. One of had just helped with a bit of research documenting the slow-down of glacial advance [EDIT: this part is confusing people. Glacial advance is not referring to the advance of the end-point (terminus) of the glacier, but the speed the ice flows within the glacier itself. the two are different.]. As Alaska and the rest of the arctic warms up (as it is [at a record and disproportionate rate](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/service/global/map-blended-mntp/201601-201612.gif)), less snow falls to fill the ice fields. These ice fields then have less mass forcing the glaciers out to sea, which has normally been a rather steady cycle for thousands of years. While it slows, it grinds less mountain up, which surprisingly provides a large majority of the micro-nutrients for phytoplankton and other sea life. Within [50 or so years](https://seagrant.uaf.edu/nosb/papers/2011/cordova-ae.php) we can expect to see a drastic drop-off of these nutrients and thus one of the bases of the oceanic food-chain. Nothing good comes of killing off the base of a food chain. The study I linked focuses on the short and long-term effects on the Salmon ecology (and the attached fishing economy), but the implications are wide-ranging and more studies are in the works.

The paris accord, by its own stated goal, would only reduce temperatures by a fraction of a degree by 2100 at the cost of trillions. Additionally, it would cripple the US economy with no assurance that other countries would abide by the same crippling sanctions. The difference between liberals and conservatives was virtue signaling vs reality. 

No one in the GOP is against clean water or clean air. We just disagree with how much we have to sacrifice to get there.
