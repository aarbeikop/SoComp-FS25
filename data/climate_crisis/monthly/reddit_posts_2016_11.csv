"5byi0k","environment","emotional","Let's get Trump to accept climate change","Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.","2016-11-09 04:45:05","22231","924","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/","True","cam_man_can","1747881819.672816","climate crisis","manual"

And are the government border policies being put in place now, for future displacement catastrophes?","I wonder if the first world leaders are setting a precedent of ""national security"" through the Syrian crisis. I mean, if they say no to refugees of war now, they then have their policies sorted and border control on high alert when whole countries like Kiribati are displaced because of sea level rise. Is this just the first world practicing and preparing for the inevitable of what's to come? 😳 ","2016-11-01 12:39:06","4","4","0.62","https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ait5i/is_the_syrian_refugee_crisis_just_the_start_of_a/","True","katie_gan","1747882880.132222","climate crisis","manual"
