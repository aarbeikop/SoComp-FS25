"ecwmddd","t3_ab0nkd","ab0nkd","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","> So how exactly did it happen that entities in the US particularly have succeeded in generating such distrust in climate science whereas for much of the rest of the world it is a no brainer?

Well... I'm an economist, specializing in public policy analysis and public economics.  My history with climate change and related issues goes back to the late '70s (I was a precocious teen, I'm not *that* old), when it was all about global **cooling**.  Other climate crises I have experienced include acid rain, DDT, CFCs and the related hole in the ozone layer, and nuclear winter.

Funny thing is, no matter what the issue was, the answer was **always** ""more government"".  Hmm...

So... global cooling.  Yeah, actual problem, easily stated- shorter growing seasons and reduced farmable area leading to food shortages and an overall reduction in the ability of the Earth to support life.  

Being an econo-zygote at the time, the economic corollary was obvious- if colder is bad (and it is) then either warmer is good/an improvement or 1975(ish) was optimal.  I was there, 1975 was not optimal.  

I then learned a great deal of economics, and watched global cooling evolve into nuclear winter fears then start becoming global *warming*.  Then Michael Mann published his 'hockey stick' paper...  By then I was a trained economist.  An important and mandatory part of economics training is econometrics- that part of statistics used and largely invented to study economic data.  

So, Mann's 'hockey stick'...  well, it was and is complete and utter statistical garbage.  It reeks of an undergrad pushing a button to apply a tool without understanding what he was doing or why.  Wrong tool, wrongly used, and oh, btw, it actually **disproves** the entire anthropogenic global warming narrative- it bends in the wrong place, 1900ish rather than 1830ish.  In other words- global warming is a natural phenomenon and **not** caused by human action.  Taking an expert's view of the climate record confirms this.  1900ish was the tail end of an unusually cold climate period known as the Little Ice Age, *of course* we see warming after.  That industrialization is also going on at the same time is merely coincidental.

So Mann publishes garbage... and no one notices?  Or cares???

Then we see the drumbeat start.  ""Global warming must be funded and studied because..."" wait, this is **my** specialty now.  And this is all hysterical bullshit.  *Badly done* hysterical bullshit at that.  'OMG, 30,000 excess deaths annually due to heat!!!'  So what, the US experiences **100,000** excess deaths in winter over summer every year.  (such basic data trends are sop to economists).  

So...  Here's an actual expert opinion for you- AGW is the greatest scientific fraud in human history, conducted to extract money and power (as usual).  There's no 'there' there.  Humans aren't causing anything, Mother Nature is.  And it doesn't matter *what's* happening, because the effects are beneficial anyway.  And the so called negatives have such long ramp up times that adaptation is basically free.  

In short- climate 'scientists' are distrusted because they are nothing but snake oil salesmen running a protection racket.  ","2018-12-30 23:15:55","1","ikonoqlast","1747917802.430093","climate crisis","manual"

Since it was ""marketed"" as an existential threat that would happen sooner rather than later when people's lives have mostly continued on like normal in the US they have slowly switched to assuming it was some sort of a scam.

They found out that there is such as thing as ""water free urinals"".

We paid a premium to purchase and install them (easily 4x the cost of a standard urinal).

Worked ok for a bit but then they started to stink, and back up, and we found out that the ""water free technology"" requires daily rinsing with 30 gallons of water and frequent change outs of this cartridge in the bottom that is supposed to stop the smells. They are constantly a problem and our maintenance teams is begging to switch back but corporate wont let them.

Switching to these urinals had no effect on our buildings water consumption, and now we spend thousands a year on fixing these urinals and buying consumables when before we spent maybe $50 the whole year on urinal cakes and they were simple to clean and maintain.

Same company, took away all trashcans in the office under the guise of ""the office should only have recycle bins because no food or drink is allowed and everything else is just paper"". Vice president of our division is in town, and catches a receptionist throwing lunch trash into recycling bin. VP gets schooled by receptionist and finds out that our site (along with almost every other office in north america) doesn't have recycling dumpsters so everything goes in the trash anyways once the janitors take it out.

It's way grosser than it sounds, and your city probably openly hates wet wipes.

There is even an episode of ""Adam ruins everything"" on this you can probably youtube. And there are tons of news articles on it too, cuz it costs taxpayers tons.

You also may want to check your city's water program. Mine had tons of info on the whole dishwasher vs handwash thing. Apparently an energy star water saving dishwasher like mine (or per my city, ANY modern dishwasher when full) uses less water than hand washing. My city recommends getting a dish scraper (they even hand them out) to scrape food off dishes instead of pre rincing.

 Pair an energy star dishwasher w some dropps brand dishwasher pods and you are all set. (Dropps does plastic free, zw, recyclable cardboard packaging. They have free trials too, check them out).","2018-12-06 05:18:54","3","upbeatbasil","1747918141.302321","climate crisis","manual"

Can we please, please stop recommending What the Health and Cowspiracy?  As many experts have pointed out, What the Health has a number of problems with false, misleading, and exaggerated claims, and misrepresenting or misunderstanding the science.  Please read this [review of it by a vegan dietitian and animal rights activist](https://www.vegan.com/posts/vegan-dietitian-review-what-the-health/), which begins:

>As a vegan health professional, I am sometimes mortified to be associated with the junk science that permeates our community. And as an animal rights activist, I’m disheartened by advocacy efforts that can make us look scientifically illiterate, dishonest, and occasionally like a cult of conspiracy theorists.  
>  
>There is a growing movement to create a more honest and evidence-based approach to vegan nutrition, though. And those of us who value this effort need to be a more visible presence in the animal rights community. We can’t allow our voices to be drowned out by the pseudoscientific noise. We need the non-vegan world to know that it is possible to stand in support of animal rights while embracing scientific integrity.

Cowspiracy has many of the same issues (not surprising since it's made by the same duo).

As Ginny Messina puts it in her review:

>\[T\]he vegan movement’s credibility is undermined when we make claims that are so easily refuted. If we get caught lying or exaggerating about the health aspects of veganism, why should anyone believe us when we try to tell them about the treatment of animals on farms, in zoos, and in research labs?
