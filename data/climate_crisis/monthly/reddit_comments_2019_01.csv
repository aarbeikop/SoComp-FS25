If all the new cars are electric/hydrogen/magic unicorn powered it wouldn't take long for the gas cars to just slowly die off.  This would also give gas stations a chance to pivot to servicing these new fuel sources.","2019-01-28 13:49:57","7","mousicle","1747919222.07375","climate crisis","manual"

We banned cars with leaded gas but sold it for years before stations stopped selling it.  We mandated seat belts but it took many years before laws requiring you to use them came about.  We had a gas crisis & mandated mileage/efficiency standards but never outlawed old cars on the road.  There's nothing to suggest that we'd ban ICE vehicles any faster.

It's not even conceivable that we'd ban them right now.  We don't have anything resembling the infrastructure to recharge them in place nor is there anyone with the manufacturing capacity to produce enough vehicles to replace all the ones on the road.","2019-01-28 13:49:41","4","PM_ME_UR_SCOOTER","1747919222.076242","climate crisis","manual"

Right now it's somewhat disjointed link spam. Nobody is going to read through all of those links. They're going to scroll through it, see a bunch of links, and upvote if they agree with the general sentiment you are trying to convey.

There were several Trumpspam posts in the same format as yours that were highly upvoted. However, when people looked at them more closely it was found that many links were dead or did not support the statement that the OP was trying to make. Thus, if you want people to become more educated and informed about your topic you really need to change the format. Otherwise it'll become an ""I agree, next post"" kind of thing.

One thing that isn't clear to me is - Where does existing law that we have now stand on this? (leaving aside how it might change in future).

Say populations damaged by extreme weather (hurricanes, floods) could make a legal case their loses were definitely due to Climate Change (to a standard a court would accept as proof).

"eey7niz","t3_ajrno0","ajrno0","futurology","unknown","If the analogy is to cigarette selling corporations, observe that right now there appears to be a debate over whether marijuana is a potential lung cancer risk.  Either outcome, an argument against corporation liability fails:

1) If marijuana is indeed a major lung cancer risk, observe what I believe to be a gigantic overlap between those advocating unrestricted rights to sell and smoke marijuana and those advocating legal liability for those arguing against the immediate need for action to eliminate carbon emissions.  If smoking marijuana turns out to be a major lung cancer risk, is this group going to agree they should be held legally liable since the example of tobacco cigarette smoking already existed for decades?  How much more intentionally negligent could one be if this is the case?

2) If smoking marijuana is found to not be a lung cancer risk, then it will have been proven that **smoking** isn't the problem, some contaminant in how tobacco cigarettes are produced is the problem.

To give another example, the idea that fat is bad for one's diet turns out to be a gigantic big lie that was done arguably to promote ""big carbohydrate"" food companies interests.  Should the people who promoted this idea be investigated for their funding sources and held legally liable for an epidemic of diabetes and possibly Alzheimer's?","2019-01-25 18:34:40","2","jphamlore","1747919785.0822332","climate crisis","manual"

"eeyjfl7","t3_ajrno0","ajrno0","futurology","unknown","Isn't cognitive dissonance a major factor in climate denialism? I think of it like someone trying to quit smoking. When your beliefs and your behavior contradict each other, you feel uneasy, but when it's very difficult to change your behavior, *often your beliefs end up changing instead*. So a smoker finds it easy to believe that the risks of smoking are exaggerated.

This isn't to say that corporations aren't to blame when they deliberately spread misinformation, just that I've seen a *lot* of people eagerly passing on misinformation, not just corporations.

(The question then becomes, if what drives denialism is the perception that getting off fossil fuels will be extremely painful, what *should* we do to get off fossil fuels? Here in Canada, the Trudeau government's plan is to use a steadily rising carbon price: first we look for ways to cut emissions that are worth less than $20/t, then those between $20/t and $30/t, and so on. I think of it as cutting back gradually, rather than trying to go cold turkey.)
