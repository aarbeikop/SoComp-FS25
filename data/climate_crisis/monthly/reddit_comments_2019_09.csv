"eyvijfh","t3_cyznyy","cyznyy","climatechange","action-oriented","All plants and animals have evolved to live in a certain climate. Put an organism evolved somewhere thousands of kilometers towards the equator, and it won't survive. Also the rate at which the climate is changing means that the large majority of organisms won't be able to move towards the poles fast enough. And if one part of an ecosystem dies (e.g. forests in Germany now that are mostly one species of tree, and that species dies), the whole ecosystem that depends on that species will follow.

In short, _all ecosystems are in dangers of just dying_. The effects are much broader and more extreme than the things you mention, horrible as they are.

And climate change is something that needs _extreme action now_, or the warming in the coming centuries becomes inevitable. Once fossil fuel is out of the Earth, it _will_ be burned and the CO2 is here to stay for millions of years, with its isolating effect that builds up over the years.","2019-09-03 07:34:35","3","[deleted]","1747930367.8428102","climate crisis","manual"

"f1ap3hp","t3_d8ht6n","d8ht6n","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","I would avoid social media and media in general when it comes to climate change. This is because the media tends to sensationalize the facts in order to get more views. They will take the most extreme outcomes predicted and make it seem like it will happen tomorrow. Instead try to find their source material in their article and read this instead. If its a primary study the abstract and conclusion are often written in layman's terms so even if you aren't a climate scientist you can get the gist of what is going on. I started with a basic introductory course on climate science from university and have since then been able to expand my understanding of climate science immeasurably. It just takes some time and effort on your part, but trust me its interesting and rewarding.

To get you started I suggest the The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They come out with reports every 10 years or so that synthesize the nearly all climate data and put it into one report. The last report came out in 2014. There most recent mini-report is on [Global Warming of 1.5c](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/). There next report which they are preparing right now will be out in 2021, this will be the 6th report. Each report is broken down into subsections:

* [Synthesis Report 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/)
   * [Summary for Policymakers - written in layman's terms](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf)
* [Mitigation of Climate Change Report 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/)
* [Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerabilities Report 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/)
* [The Physical Science Report 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/)

I suggest starting with the summary for policymakers as it is written in layman's terms and probably the easiest starting point for someone who has no background in climate science. Another important thing to know is that these reports are generated using models that try and predict the future based on a few key factors. First, is the data that is coming in real time from climate scienctists - how fast sea level is rising, how fast the oceans are warming, how much CO2 and other greenhouse gases are in the atmosphere etc. The second major component is how humans are reacting to climate change - are we doing nothing and continuing on business as usual (e.g. worst-case-scenario) or are we doing everything we can to help stop and potentially even reverse climate change (e.g. best-case-scenario). When you read the reports you will se a range of predictions (e.g. between 0.2 meters to 1 meter sea level rise by 2100). The low end is the best case scenario, the high end is the worst case scenario.

Unfortunately, right now we are closer to the worst-case-scenario models than the best-case-scenario models. That is humans haven't really done a good job at curbing our emissions or changing our ways. As it stands we are on track for a 1 to 2 meter sea level rise by 2100. That may not seem like much, but many countries around the world are at or below sea level. With a 1 meter rise, Bangladesh the most densely populated country in the world will lose about 1/3 of its land displacing *tens of millions* of people and whole island-nations in the South Pacific will slip beneath the waves forever destroying their *entire* nation. This is in contrast to some media reports that I have seen that claim an 80m sea level rise! What they fail to tell you is that this degree of rise *is* expected but in about 300-500+ years when Antartica and Greenland melt out completely. Instead of reporting on what is actually going to affect us (e.g. 1-2m rise by 2100) they report on the extreme scenario which isn't predicted to role out for many generations.

So climate change is going to have some real consequences for people, especially the poor and marginalized. Its important to understand what is going to happen, but not to be fear mongering about it.

If you would like to know more about how climate change is going to impact your region of the world local governments often have special websites dedicated to showing what is expected to happen. I know the USA and Canada have some very good websites - here is the one for the [USA](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/). Otherwise I can try to answer any questions you may have, I don't have any links on hand for India but I do know that Bangladesh is going to suffer greatly at the hands of climate change, as a result India should expect tens of millions of climate refugees while having ***hundreds of millions*** of your own. Honestly, I am not going to sugar coat it, the Indian subcontinent is going to suffer, and is  frankly already suffering greatly at the hands of climate change. Those yearly heat waves, water shortages, etc are all going to become more common and more extreme because of climate change. This is just the tip of the iceberg for India (& the subcontinent).

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/ldLBoErAhz4) explaining what the Earth looked like last time the Earth warmed as much as it is expected to warm with the expected current degree of change (i.e. if we don't get off our butts and continue what we are doing we will break 2c and head towards an unknown amount of warming above 2c but probably below 8c as we move past 2100 and into the next century).

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/9GjrS8QbHmY) explaining what a 1-2c rise in Earth's average temperature would look like - we are nearly locked in for at least 1.5c with a projected 2c rise by 2100.","2019-09-24 04:58:54","3","Jaagsiekte","1747930828.938897","climate crisis","manual"

It slows down progression and will result in us as a species from becoming the projectors of life on Earth.","2019-09-08 19:22:51","1","Proxyminers1986","1747931024.064363","climate crisis","manual"

Now, not everything comes down to individual end consumers (e.g. military), but a lot of it *does*.

It is just an excuse people use to avoid actually making any changes.","2019-09-10 02:18:07","7","[deleted]","1747931270.475439","climate crisis","manual"

"f0tagb5","t3_d6f3t0","d6f3t0","conspiracy","unknown","You need to stop ""being"" an ideology.

People are not democrats. They support the democratic ideology.

Maybe you support such an ideology, and I myself can say that I support a bit of both the Red/Blue ideologies, but making one of them into your identity is the first step towards separating yourself from your own brothers and sisters, who all aim to make life better regardless of their ideology.

This is where we get lost, devolving into cult-like behaviors where other cults are your opposition that must be defeated.

This is entirely the wrong way to go about things.

We should not be trying to defeat ourselves, we should be trying to find the best ideologies that most people can agree with, and find ways to also support and integrate the people we don't agree with.","2019-09-19 18:44:50","6","HeyJesusBringMeABeer","1747931454.491664","climate crisis","manual"

I have a feeling in the not too distant future a lot are finally going to wake up to that knowledge, same goes with religion, races, nationalities and all the other factors that drive us into an “us vs them” mentality. We can’t ever really be truly united and in harmony if we’re stuck in a mindset that any one of these views are more “correct” than the others. I hope some day we can start seeing all political parties, races, genders etc as “good vs evil” and work together to bring about more good for the world.","2019-09-19 15:25:09","2","StarHunter419","1747931454.4958389","climate crisis","manual"

"f0si140","t3_d6f3t0","d6f3t0","conspiracy","unknown","So do you. Your bs and the thing you cling to is “there is no (fill in the blank).” 

Fact is Jesus is real. God is real. Climate change is BS. Democrats are nuts. Republicans are no different. Two parties one agenda. 

I can make the argument through logic and reason that there is intelligent design. That there has to be a creator. That something with infinite knowledge exists. It’s very logical and reasonable. It’s much more insane and taking a much bigger leap of faith to believe what you do. 

You can’t prove a supernatural God doesn’t exist. 

And ps WTF does this have to do with conspiracy other than you felt like going on a rant and insulting at minimum half the world’s population or over 3.5 BILLION people???","2019-09-19 15:01:02","1","[deleted]","1747931454.498807","climate crisis","manual"
