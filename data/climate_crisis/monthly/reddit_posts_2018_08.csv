"93q1s2","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","How will climate change impact US politics in the next 10 years?","The US is in a unique place globally with respect to having a major party (GOP) maintaining a dismissive stance toward the global scientific consensus and the current administration opting out of the Paris Accord. 

Public acceptance of anthropogenic climate change has been rising in polls in the last year as evidence of consequences and causation mount. Despite this, the threat indicators of climate change are unique and unprecedented and humans are not well adapted to proactively face this threat.

Some \*\*highlights\*\* of the consequences of climate change:

1) Continuous warming - increasing +0.2C per decade at current emission levels. 2015-2018 are the 4 hottest years on record. 

2) More Extreme evaporation (drought/fire/agri losses) and precipitation (flooding) cycles. 

3) More extreme weather  - Arctic warming is proceeding 2-3x faster than the rest of the globe and causing weakening of the jet stream in the N. Hemisphere. Also, the Gulfstream which transfers heat from the equator to the N. Atlantic region is slowing. 

4) Sea level rise (SLR) - The oceans are expanding as they heat up and polar ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate. 

For purposes of projecting inflection points in the future, SLR seems to be the variable which will become most able to be predictable in the future. Tremendous investment in satellite based technology and ocean sensors is proving an increasingly granular understanding of the factors influencing SLR.  

The gold standard of scientific consensus on climate change comes from the IPCC.  However, since the IPCC's most recent reports are based upon 5-6 year old science, I would direct any interested parties to check out the US National Climate Assessment of 2017 linked here for the best and most recent consensus.

Currently, the federal government subsidizes the National Flood Insurance Program and offers below market coverage in areas where private insurers are not offering coverage. This program is underwater (no pun intended) by over $20B due to cumulative losses to date exceeding premiums collected.  Most of the losses have been concentrated in Louisiana which has had several 500 year floods in the last decade. 

In the next year or two, insurance underwriters will be converting to maps which incorporate projections of sea level rise and a domino effect will impact coastal real estate and financial markets. As flood insurance rates increase, coastal and other flood prone real estate values will be impacted. This will impact municipalities who are dependent upon property tax revenue at the same time they will be at risk of credit downgrades (from agencies like S&P and Moody's) and increasing adaptation and mitigation costs. 

The financial meltdown will precede the inundation when the science is solid enough to give a reasonable prediction of the timing of future SLR. My hunch is that a correction an order of magnitude larger than the '07 crisis could come by the early 2030's and result in widespread municipal bankruptcy.  

At some point along the way, the requisite response to the climate crisis is going to necessitate a transformation of our govt's approach to the problem and governance approach in general. So much of the energy of the political subs here on reddit seems to be on short-term transactional politics and I thought it might be interesting and useful to discuss how politics is going to be impacted by the transformation of the earth's climate system.
