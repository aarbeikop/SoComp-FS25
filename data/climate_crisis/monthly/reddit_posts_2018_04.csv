"88s8mb","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse q1 2018","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.
 
I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.
 
I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

"8cxq6b","futurology","unknown","Hello! I’m Meera Subramanian, a journalist writing the series Finding Middle Ground: Conversations Across America for InsideClimate News. Please AMA!","Hi there! I’m Meera Subramanian, a freelance journalist writing the series [Finding Middle Ground: Conversations Across America](https://insideclimatenews.org/middle-ground) for InsideClimate News. 

From [Georgia peach farmers](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31082017/climate-change-georgia-peach-harvest-warm-weather-crop-risk-farmers) facing a failed harvest after a too-warm winter to a [West Virginia town](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19102017/christianity-evangelical-climate-change-flooding-west-virginia) recovering from a devastating flood, I've been exploring how conservative Americans are considering climate change impacts in their own lives. I've met [Wisconsin dogsledders](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21122017/climate-change-no-snow-sled-dogs-dryland-racing-politics-wisconsin) adjusting to racing on dry land when the snows don’t come and [students in West Texas](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26122017/wind-energy-jobs-booming-texas-clean-renewable-power-climate-change) thrilled about their future as wind turbine technicians. 

**I've sought to open conversations in the most red-leaning parts of the country about climate change — an issue that's become so deeply politicized — and found a complicated middle ground that most Americans inhabit when it comes to  changes happening to the places that sustain them. I've listened, questioned and listened again, inside city halls and orchards, gun shops and churches.**

**I want to hear from you. Please AMA about the complex ways people are thinking (or not) about climate change and its impacts** 

What happens when the crop your family has been growing for five generations is failing because temperatures are rising? When your favorite trout-fishing rivers are closed too many days of the year because there's no water? When is the weird weather too much to explain away? When do the storms come too close to home? What to make of climate cycles that should be making things cooler, not warmer? Are humans tweaking with Mother Nature? 
 
I'm honored that the series was a [finalist for the Scripps Howard Award](http://www.scripps.com/foundation/news/1130-scripps-howard-awards-honor-the-best-in-journalism-with-finalists-in-15-categories). You can [find more about me and my work here](https://meerasub.org/). 
 
My approach to writing is to bring together science and storytelling. Most of my questions revolve around understanding how people are connected to the natural world in which they live. This has led me from the East Coast to the West, where I lived in a barn in Oregon for many years, and back to the East, where I got a graduate degree in journalism from NYU. For the past dozen years, I've been freelancing, [my writing appearing in Nature, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Orion, and others](http://meerasub.org/writing/), as well as anthologies such as [Best American Science and Nature Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Science-Nature-Writing/dp/054428674X) and [Best Women’s Travel Writing](http://meerasub.org/book/). I also wrote a book: [A River Runs Again, India’s Natural World in Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610395301/) (PublicAffairs 2015), about how ordinary South Asians are facing multiple environmental crises. Before I began the Middle Ground series for InsideClimate News last year, I was a Knight Science Journalism fellow at MIT. 

Please join me in a conversation, and ask me anything about what I've experienced in my reporting, as well as share your thoughts on what you've been seeing in your life related to climate change.

**EDIT: Thanks for all your good questions, Reddit! We're wrapping up this AMA now because I'm on the road, heading to North Dakota and Montana for more InsideClimate News reporting, from the ranch lands and rivers of the Interior West.
