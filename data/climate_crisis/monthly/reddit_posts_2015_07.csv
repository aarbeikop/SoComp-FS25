We're the Lancet Commission on Public Health and Climate, a group of medical doctors, climate scientists, economists and energy experts that have recently released a major report on our policy options for reducing the health impacts of climate change.  Formally titled [Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health](http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/climate-change), this report not only details the many different ways global warming is a medical emergency, but more importantly it lays out some of our options for confronting this crisis. 

We can answer questions about how climate change impacts health (through things like heat waves or malaria) as well as the flip side, what we can do about the problem in terms of policies and economics. It turns out that when you switch from coal to low carbon energy, you not only help the climate, but also see an immediate health benefit. Hospital admissions decrease and cardiovascular and respiratory disease rates decrease, overall reducing costs for the healthcare system and improving countless lives, all while reducing carbon pollution. 

Hopefully there are plenty of questions, because we have a number of experts ready to answer!

**Moderator note:**

There has been a lot of drama related to AMAs on reddit recently, we're working through the issues, but we did not think that this AMA should be canceled because of everything, the issues raised are real, and important, and we want to give you a chance to learn more about it directly from the people involved.

Thanks for all of your support during this time, we really just want to be able to bring the community the best content on a continuing basis.

"3dukvy","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Why didn't Obama go through with his promises?","President Obama rode into the White House on a platform of capital-C-Change. The Democratic Party controlled the Senate & Congress for the first few years, the country was just tired of Bush and the wars, the Great Financial Crisis was just happening, ...  
It was the perfect climate to actually go through with all promises and improve not only the US but also the World.  

&nbsp;

So how did he do: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ 

&nbsp;

So why isn't it more?  
* He wasn't sincere about it. http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/05/exclusive-how-obamas-early-career-succes-was-built-on-fronting-for-chicago-real-estate-and-finance.html  
* He wanted to but then was persuaded (not in a conspiracy way). Whether it be the classified information angle, fear of backlash (e.g. if a ex-Gitmo-detainee ever just even stole a Snickers bars it would be Obams's fault) and thus playing the safe route (""National Security is a one way street"" - Sascha Lobo), being around different advisors, ...  
* He wanted to but the System^TM is too strong. (System being Lobbyists, Military-Industrial-Complex, Partisan gridlock & politics, ... Pick as you want)  
* I'm wrong and he did accomplish more than usual.
