"cu0akuf","t3_3gporh","3gporh","science","scientific","I've looked at Tim Wise's paper [here](http://steadystate.org/wp-content/uploads/Jackson_2009_Beyond_the_Growth_Economy.pdf), about how much grams of CO2 per dollar of GDP produced has to decline, if we want to continue to grow our economy.

According to Wise's calculations linked to above, if we want to stop climate change, but also want 9 billion people by 2050 to have the standard of living the EU has in 2007, CO2 per dollar of GDP will have to decline from 768 in 2007, to just 14 grams per dollar by 2050.

That looks really difficult to me on first sight, so I have the following questions:

Is it really possible to reconcile the desire for economic growth with the desire to address climate change?

Should we look at a steady-state economy, that no longer grows, as a solution to climate change?

Why does the IPCC seem to assume in all its scenarios that the economy will keep growing?","2015-08-12 12:38:52","292","achjapuntdrie","1747859374.664295","climate crisis","manual"
"cu09znh","t3_3gporh","3gporh","science","scientific","Thanks very much for answering a few questions here, Prof. Hansen and Prof. Hearty. EDIT: And Dr. Tselioudis and Dr. Kharecha!

As both a moderator here and somebody who frequently spends (perhaps ""wastes"") a lot of timing debating with climate change deniers online, it's clear to see that many of the online commenters are just the tip of a mass media effort to redefine climate change as a political argument in order to detract from the science and make the implications of climate change something to dismiss as socialist/liberal alarmism. Many popular mass media publications regularly ridicule the scientists and science of climate change, and anyone that accepts the science in general, all the while driving home the point that it's a political issue, not a scientific or even societal one. Then reaching further up the ladder, we see entire political parties express almost venomous hate toward anything climate science, while even the governments that claim to believe the science are still mostly allowing and often encouraging fossil fuel explorations.

The plan to *prevent* meaningful action on climate change does appear to have been an enormous success.

So, my main question is, what will it take to change this?

Protesting and writing letters to our representatives doesn't appear to have done enough so far. Often it seems that people are even more politically entrenched in their opposition to climate change actions nowadays than a decade ago. Almost every national and international scientific institution has declared that climate change is real and caused by human activities, thousands of scientific reports and papers are published every year, evidence is constantly accumulating to show that we are the cause and things are already becoming unstable, yet here we still are, applying all this work and effort only for our wheels to continue spinning in the mud.

I've seen many mainstream news articles about the latest dire climate science that report the findings accurately, and then conclude by suggesting (often by citing a quote from you) that a carbon price will be enough to prevent the worst.

A carbon fee-and-dividend, as Citizens' Climate Lobby proposes, seems like a great first step, but it seems clear that much more is needed, very soon, to draw down emissions as rapidly as necessary to prevent a rise of 2C or more (and even more to avoid 1.5C, as you advocate).

Other climate scientists like Michael Mann have advocated for an [economic mobilization on the scale of the American World War II mobilization](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org) to eliminate and withdraw excess greenhouse gas emissions, and a growing number of people, including CCL founder Marshall Saunders, are [signing a pledge](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/notable_pledge_signers) to endorse this platform and build toward the massive political will necessary to achieve it in the U.S.

I've been feeling conflicted lately, so I just have a quick question. It's true we need to start taking action, and with all of this attention drawn to needing an **urgent** reduction in GHG, I find it frustrating that some drivers get ignored. I recently came upon a number of studies that put animal agriculture as a very major driver of climate change,^[1](http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm),[2](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)  and that they will only get worse^[3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v515/n7528/full/nature13959.html). How can we tackle the contributions to carbon dioxide emissions due to animal agriculture, and should this be something we deal with as a nation? Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.^[4](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294) As a very politicized topic, is it ever possible for our government to endorse a slow reduction of consumption of animal products, or a similar initiative? How can we ardently push for reduction in transportation and reorganization of our energy sources (which I completely agree with) but willingly ignore this very integral part of climate change?

By which I mean, possibly many areas will experience increased drought, possibly many areas will experience increased storm frequency and intensity, possibly many species in the oceans would die from increased acidification, and consequently we would probably see drastically reduced biodiversity.

However, none of the above necessarily entails that *many human lives would be lost* due to climate change, which is what most people care about. Drought is handled by transportation or relocation, storms are handled by construction or relocation, and loss of biodiversity is handled by our reliance on agriculture. So even if climate engineering were to fail, our other means of mitigating the problems aren't necessarily inapplicable simply because the climate changes. Would you agree with this assessment? I think this belief that humans aren't really at risk may hold many people back from endorsing swift and immediate change.

I endorse change simply because tens of thousands of people per year *already die* from air pollution in the US alone, which is a *real and quantifiable cost* we're paying right now. The costs of anthropogenic warming seem less clear by comparison, and if you can't quantify it in real terms as being *even more costly* than the tens of thousands of lives per year we're clearly already willing to sacrifice, then convincing such people would be difficult indeed.","2015-08-12 13:52:01","3","naasking","1747859374.740107","climate crisis","manual"

I am kind of at my wits' end with my father and his attitude toward global warming.  He believes that carbon emissions are damaging and that global warming is happening, but that it isn't as bad as people say it is.  He says that we have recently come out of an ice age, therefore it is somewhat expected that the earth is going to warm up a bit.  We may be damaging the environment, but a lot of the symptoms of carbon emissions can be attributed to natural causes.

Is there any article that you know of that I can use as a counter-argument?  His argument is so specific that I find it difficult to quickly and easily trump it.

I cope with this by understanding that while we not be able to survive in the long-term, evolution is embodied in the Universe. The Universe *is* evolution in a sense, and this means that somewhere a species might have the collective intelligence to make it to the stars.

(1) Per Tian & Sherwood et al; could double-ITCZ and tropical atmospheric deep convective mixing indicate that the equilibrium climate sensitivity used in your models is too low?

(2) Per Schroder et al indicates that both the geothermal heat flux and the associated subglacial meltwater drainage system in the Byrd Subglacial Basin is more significant than previously thought; should you at least mention this risk factor in your draft paper?

(3) Per Krasting et al if/when anthropogenic GHG emission rates increase above present day values the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions, TCRE, will increase, thus requiring that climate models apply higher TCRE responses in their models; have you applied such probably higher TCRE responses in your models?

(4) von Deimling et al and Schuur et al cite relatively high risks of GHG emissions from permafrost degradation and in particular from methane emissions by mid-century from thermokarst activity; do you believe that your modeling efforts have captured such carbon-cycle positive feedback risks?

"cu0bji2","t3_3gporh","3gporh","science","scientific","Professors, we all hear about the typical variations of climate predictions (IPCC variety projections, and occasionally about the worst case scenarios), but what is the best case scenario for us that we can really strive to and inspire people who feel hopeless given the non-stop barrage of bad news coming out.

In particular, since the biggest driver for change is economic, and solar power generation is rapidly diving below costs for both gas and coal fired power plants, and especially so in markets likely to contribute to fastest growth in IPCC estimates (South Asia, Africa, China), how hopeful can we be that there might be a sudden and steep fall of the cliff for fossil fuel usage as it no longer becomes economically sound to mine coal and burn them in enormous power plants instead of just slapping more power panels.

Further, if it does come to transpire (that Fossil Fuel power generation completely becomes uneconomic and abandoned rapidly worldwide), what are the best case consequences we can aspire to.. will a sudden and steep crash in CO2 emissions within the next decade or two (and keeping well below IPCC carbon budget), save us from most of the dire consequences? Are we screwed anyway because of locked in feedback loops with polar and glacial ice cap melting? Is anybody even studying these scenarios of largescale economics driven abandonment of fossil fuel usage for primary power generation?

They turn these things into self-fulfilling prophecies; the public itself couldn't really care less most of the time.

There's a lot of hooplah right now about Donald Trump's apparent immunity to poll consequences for the stupid things he says ... but I've suspected for a long time that it's a public figure's own perception that the media knows what it's talking about that causes them to backpedal, apologize, and/or resign over things. If they stuck it out, the media would grow bored, stop talking about it, and the voting population (aside from hardcore political zealots) would resume not caring, if they ever did.

Trump simply refuses to apologize for a thing no matter what the media says ... and lo and behold, the public doesn't just buy the narrative that the media has been spoonfeeding everyone about what ""should"" happen or is ""supposed to happen."" The media is in *shock* that they did not correctly predict what his supporters were thinking before they thought it (what the media informed them in advance that they're going to think).

So-called ""conventional wisdom"" is something put together by the very people reporting on it. They create the very drama that they're reporting on.

The definition of veganism (see side bar) includes this when it mentions ""cruelty"". Not much is more cruel than harming and denying a species their own habitat.

Vegans often overlook wildlife, and this is a HUGE problem. Without recognizing them, veganism becomes 'veganism for the sake of veganism'. When we're all vegan, who will benefit most from it? Certainly not livestock, there will be some in sanctuaries, but mostly non-existent. Wildlife is really who will benefit most from veganism in the long-run, and we need to keep that in mind now, and defend their habitat. A 'vegan' world with few free-living animals will be a sad one indeed.

Further on this, I've summarized some good graphs that really highlight just how much space livestock take up on the planet - everyone should be aware of this, imo: http://blog.thevictoriavegan.com/2014/10/humane-meat-its-not-humane-for-nature.html
