"e2jpqcl","t3_8zlf7b","8zlf7b","environment","emotional","I agree with you that it’s shit. But what does your doomsday attitude solve? Nothing.

Trying to talk to people who struggle to understand the science or just plain refuse to believe facts, coming at them with ‘here’s the situation, there’s nothin you can do about it, we’re all going to die’ is just a self fulfilling prophecy. If they don’t think there’s any point in trying they won’t.

Instead, I would challenge you to look at the positive things that are being done to limit the impact of CC, and adapt to the likely effects, and have a bit of hope. 

Governments are moving slowly towards where we need them to be heading, picking up momentum (granted, 20 years late). Yeah Trump has poopooed the Paris agreement for his country but he’s temporary, and individual states are doing things anyway. China is at least *trying* to balance economic growth/getting people out of poverty with environmentalism. The EU are doing a lot of good shit. Smaller countries are getting on board and that aggregate effect is not insignificant. At some point it will become a political default that climate change is a top priority and corporations that get caught behind the times will lose out.

Scientists aren’t sitting around with their thumbs up their asses but are looking at new techs for carbon sequestration, alternative energy sources, GMOs, checking and re-checking climate models, and even looking at simpler things like how to make flood protection better

A lot of the citizenry are still occupied with ‘small time’ schemes or missing the point a little bit (ban plastic straws etc) but the trend is that more and more people are indicating CC and the environment is of strong concern to them which leads back to a new political default position.

You say you’re now realising we are not going to address this crisis but ... come on, when were we ever? If you’ve been researching CC for the last 10 years you no doubt know we were NEVER going to avoid CC. The half life of CO2 in the atmosphere is something like 30 years so shit that was up there before I was even born is still up there greenhousing and how could we reasonably be expected to rewind that when people didn’t even realise it was a problem till it was already up there?

People are going to die (/are already dying - heat waves, Syrian civil war caused by a 4 year drought etc etc) and it will be a massive time of social upheaval, no one who knows what they’re talking about can really dispute that. But the longer we take to sort our shit out the worse it gets.

I’m not gonna tell you to think of your children or anything like that. Just life your life, as someone who has gone out of their way to become educated, doing what you know is right. Even if you just take the time every now and again to educate someone else/Spread the message. It’s better than nothing.

"e2jns7m","t3_8zlf7b","8zlf7b","environment","emotional","I have a suggestion. Before I start, if you find it ridiculous or too drastic then I remind you to remember what the alternative is.

A single international government with supreme power would provide the necessary coordination. It could for example set mandatory targets to each country, ensure necessary technologies are shared, prioritize R&D, ensure that resistant parties (such as fossil fuel interests) are ignored, ensure necessary projects are initiated asap (such as clean energy plants) and eliminate the need for lengthy negotiations between countries.

But how do we get there? Each country can start a political party with the one priority of creating this international government, with everything else secondary. If enough parties around the world gain enough following then it is possible that together they could do it. Or there could be more forceful means: if only powerful countries are willing then they could force other countries militarily to participate.

I remind you again what the alternative is.","2018-07-17 15:26:32","18","tarquin1234","1747910181.9397252","climate crisis","manual"
"e2jq4s4","t3_8zlf7b","8zlf7b","environment","emotional","I agree.  Perhaps the right answer is to be like Noam Chomsky.  Work hard to fix the problems, otherwise apathy will just make them worse.  But this problem is just so large scale, so engrained in our economies, that the only way to fix it would be to drastically lower the standard of living everywhere.

I’m not having kids.  If I did, now, if the predictions are accurate, they would jot be able to eat any seafood by 2048.  The fisheries would be toast.  There would be 150 million climate refugees according to the UN.  Chocolate would be gone.  Other food crops would go extinct due to changing climates.

What I’m most worried about is the fallout.  I think this is why the business as usual approach continues.  Our economy relies on private investment, which relies in faith that the future will be better than the present.  What happens when the straw breaks the camels back, and people realize widespread we’re really screwed?  

What are you going to do in the food riots?

All I can think about doing that makes sense is to get an acreage, get on solar, get my own well with water treatment, and get some farming going.  The less we are dependent on this “all our eggs in one basket” economy the better.  

Or I could buy a Tesla, donate to green peace and pretend the smart people will fix it all for us (despite any real incentive)

Sigh.  Life is hard when you choose to not be ignorant.

  I’m a new sub, so this is the first one of your posts I’m reading. I read through about half of the articles before I had to take a break, so this post isn’t as much about the content, but rather the context of the post. I wanted to first say what an amazing job you’ve done collecting these sources. It is imperative that we know the information presented here, and because it’s not sexy enough to sell papers, I don’t think it gets presented often. This leads me to a couple questions.   
  
  1. How can I assist you in doing what you’re doing? I truly believe presenting facts in the face of folly is important, and if I can help, I want to. 
  
  2. How best can we share this information? Have you found a way that works best?

Going to shamelessly advertise since it seems people need some hope: in the U.S., there is a federal climate lawsuit on October 29th called Juliana v. U.S. I work for the nonprofit supporting the 21 youth plaintiffs. If we win, the courts will order that the U.S. government must follow our proposed science-based climate recovery plan. We will have some top scientists testifying and it's likely we'll win, but if you can attend a rally/host one in your city on 10/29 to show your support, it will provide the pressure we need.
