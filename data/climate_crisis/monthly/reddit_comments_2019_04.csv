This comes at a time when more farmers are moving to short-season crops to deal with a shorter and shorter growing season and more volatile weather in the Midwest, where Kernza could potentially thrive. And the most positive description of the taste is ""sweet but grassy."" 

I love the idea and that these companies are putting anything into exploring greener ag options, but this will require billions more in R&D over the next decades to change anything. The Land Institute has done some great marketing around this to raise awareness, but the potential for technology and genetically modifying existing crops is far greater than Kernza.","2019-04-14 20:39:20","886","[deleted]","1747924085.669318","climate crisis","manual"

"ekvjozv","t3_bd3ocp","bd3ocp","futurology","unknown","Personally, I think we need to go perennial, get serious about eating carbohydrates derived from trees, look at phreatophytes (which have roots going 50+ *meters* deep, scale up agroecology research and its practice, support the food sovereignty (Via la campesina) movement, treat permaculture like a legitimate engineering and landscape architecture science, ratchet up funding to study traditional ecological knowledge, AND start eating and marketing palatable leaves. We need it all. And we need to produce substantially more calories on substantially less land. The ONLY food production systems that do this are traditional, highly diversified agroecosystems. And they do it incredibly well, frequently producing 10-20 times more calories per acre. In fact they produce 50%  of the world's food on a fraction of the land, while maintaining exceptional biodiversity including ""food forests."" Unfortunately, traditional farmers around the globe are facing unprecedented land grabs by corporate interests who promise local food security through inedible industrial crops. 

Though I support it, and though it may be co-opted toward truly sustainable agriculture in the future, the dirty secret of the organic movement is that it simply has not been able to consistently surpass yields of industrialized agriculture. 

Why does all of this matter? Because low yields mean more land is needed. It means more forest is converted to field. It means diversity is traded for monoculture. It means an acceleration, NOT deceleration of climate change. And even more critically, it means positive feedback loops in species extinctions and ecosystem collapses.","2019-04-14 15:41:32","22","realestnwah","1747924085.674912","climate crisis","manual"
