The thing that convinced me to have my one and only child was my Dad telling me about his time in naval intelligence shortly before I was born. He, and everyone around him, was sure that the world was destined to experience a nuclear exchange any minute, and he had the same misgivings about having children that I had in relation to the climate crisis that we are currently experiencing. Regardless of his extreme doubts that humanity would survive, here we all are. I’m hardly convinced that we are capable of fixing our obvious problems, but Homo sapiens have been through some serious shit in the past, and this leads me to have hope for the future. I could, of course, be too optimistic (first time for everything, I suppose) but there’s reasons to have hope that we will survive and thrive in the future. There’s also reason to hope that the little person I’m raising could be part of the solution. YMMV.","2019-06-06 20:59:35","19","Animastj","1747926228.429856","climate crisis","manual"

"eqw8r1d","t3_bzerug","bzerug","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","Serious answer, biodiversity loss. We are in the midst of Earths [6th mass extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction). Only 5 such events have occurred in the past, each experiencing between 75-95% species loss. We are on track to lose 50% by mid-century with a further loss of 75% by 2100. There are many factors at play here - number one is habitat loss mainly through direct habitat destruction (e.g. slash-&-burn, converting forest in farmland, drudging the ocean floor) but also through other means such as:

* over-hunting & over-fishing
* illegal poaching & illegal capture of flora & fauna for trade
* invasive species
* pollution & agricultural run-off
* resource stripping
* climate change

As much as we like to think we could survive with just our domesticated crops and animals we can't. We need healthy ecosystems in order to survive on this planet. Healthy ecosystems are resilient to climate change, unhealthy ones will crumble in the face of it.

"esf8fci","t3_c7ggzd","c7ggzd","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I'm 22, studied climate science for a few months and came to some pretty abysmally grim concluslions. Whenever I try to talk about it I get shouted down. People aren't ready to hear it yet. I understand. But when they are and if you are, I'd recommend seeking solace in nihilism. The coming mass-extinction could potentially be one of the greatest in Earth's history, but it's still highly unlikely life will be totally extinguished. We basically just have to let go of our egos and accept our mortality. The existential dillemma of extinction is one we will almost certainly have to inevitably face regardless, whether in the form of a global climate disaster or a meteor or a supervolcano or the rapid expansion of the sun into a red giant. Time is relative. Size is relative. Perhaps when the dust settles life will undergo another rapid increase in diversity akin to the cambrian explosion. The reason it hurts so bad to watch is because the way the Earth is now is what we're used to. It's beautiful to us because that's what we grew up (evolved) with. But it's ultimately meaningless. I've become convinced that life in general is just a mechanism of entropy, capturing and dispersing energy like eddies in a stream. Once you detach yourself from the intimacy of it and the desire for it to go differently, you just get to observe the greatest show in the history of the universe. You're a teeny tiny little colony of naturally-emergent microscopic machines floating in a vast sea of dead, inert matter. Your particles, out of ALL the particles in the known universe, get to carry SENTIENCE. And not only that, we're some of the richest people with the greatest access to the most resources in the history of humankind. This could truly be the golden age. And for all its flaws, I personally wouldn't trade it for a stagnant eternity of unceasing human degeneracy as we spread throughout the cosmos infecting everything we touch. I mean seriously, what's the end goal here? For most people it's ""make more and more people, forever."" Just enjoy it. We're a bunch of apes. We just need to let some of the air out of our heads and brace ourselves for the rollercoaster!

"esfqgep","t3_c7ggzd","c7ggzd","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","No need to thank me, man, thank YOU for sharing your feelings with a random stranger like me! I hear what you're saying and see the validity there, and you're right that for me it's about utility. Nihilism isn't just an answer to a problem, though; I really do believe it does a better job at approaching ""truth"" than conventional frameworks of reality, morality and meaning. It's not an answer, but a lack of one. It's screaming into the void and hearing nothing but your own voice echoing back. To some that feeling is horrifying, but I find it comforting. No judge at the end to tell us we failed. No more burning questions to answer. No dreams or goals to aspire to except those which are the most useful and the most true to who you are. I can see how this all comes across as a ""fuck it"" sort of sense of abandon, but it's really not. I compared a man-made climate disaster to all those far-off natural disasters because they're all completely out of our individual control. We are chemical machines. Free will is an illusion. We are products of our biology and of our environments, and how we will respond to different situations is determined almost entirely by these two factors alone. Circumstance is the great driver behind who we are and what we do. Circumstance and entropy, like I said before. And also like I said before, time is completely relative, so much so that I'd suggest it's more of a percieved phenomenon than a physical mechanism. Time, like distance, speed, size, etc. can only be defined in relation to other objects within a higher dimensional space. A thousand years, a million years, a billion; what does it matter? What is the benefit of humanity being extant for a longer period of time? Have we benefitted life on Earth, do you think? Is the world we've created superior to the natural order which has persisted for so many years that our brains can't even truly comprehend the size of the number? Nihilism to me is the acceptance that everything is ULTIMATELY meaningless and ULTIMATELY temporary, but that is not at all true on every level. With no ULTIMATE meaning to turn to I have the freedom to, in good conscience, create my own meaning. Just picture yourself observing the world from a different angle, right? Humans ravaging the environment is pretty awful from the perspective of us megafauna (and really to most plant and animal life tbh), but to anaerobic bacteria? The lack of newly created oxygen from photosynthesizing plants could lead to a brand new explosion in the diversity of life! Even if we go extinct, there's evidence that life was around when the entire surface of the planet was molten lava. There will always be something new, and that new stuff will be just as beautiful to any observer born into it as our world is to us. We live in an emergent world, and change is always inevitable. Not even the universe itself is static. Humanity would need to collectively come together in a way that's frankly impossible to stop this crazy train, and even then the Earth's climate might just snowball into another Venus-like hothouse from the few degrees it's already warmed. If you think the stuff you read about is scary shit, bro, I PROMISE you, that was just the tip. So we could either suffer and hate ourselves for being a part of something inevitable and out of our control, or accept that it's as random and meaningless as everything else that happens in the vast cosmos and try to enjoy ourselves and love each other while we still can. We have a very unique opportunity here! I've spent my whole life genuinely terrified of how inadequate our species is. As I am included in that species and was also one of the only people I knew at the time who saw what was happening, I held myself personally responsible for every piece of trash I threw out, every drop of water I wasted, etc. I HATED myself, I HATED humanity, and at the same time I believed all the darkness inside me was righteous and good. It almost killed me, but I chose to stay here for my family and those I love. I forced myself to change my attitude and abandon my ideas of meaning and purpose because I had no choice but to do that or live my life as a miserable, depressed, self-loathing misanthrope who was probably headed down a very dark path. Now, although I still see and feel many of the same things about humanity's trajectory, the hate and anger is replaced by love and understanding. Before, I saw humanity as a wretched disease plagueing this beautiful, perfect planet and I prayed every night for our extinction. Now I see the beauty within us all. The love, the wonder, the hope. We are such incredible creatures, man, and the world is intensely fascinating. If it never changed it would lose what makes it special. Without suffering, there would be no comparison by which to define pleasure. We're beautiful BECAUSE we're temporary and imperfect, not in spite of it. Idk. I wish there was more I could do to help all the people in the world who are scared and in pain, and I know it's only going to get worse...so I do what I can and try not to dwell on the rest. I try to be kind to people. I share the stupid BS that helps me through. Someone people find solace in religion and in the blatant lie of objective meaning and to each their own, but I don't think we always need an answer. Sometimes we need to just BE. It's not a crime. We're just animals. Thanks for responding so thoughtfully though, I was really happy to see more people beginning to realize the mess we're in. If there's any possibility change COULD happen, it'll happen through spreading the message just like you are and by people banding together and comparing strategies against a common struggle just like we are. In the meantime, though, I'm not emotionally capable of handling that much pain when it hasn't even happened yet. There will be plenty of time to panic and mourn now that the countdown has begun. If u wanna scare yourself more, look into population growth trends, the history of agriculture and increasing crop yields, the diminishing returns of new technologies, and the biggest one would be refrigeration and the global refrigerant industries. For a taste, CO2 is a major problem even though the amount of CO2 released annually into the atmosphere hasnt increased more than marginally since the mid 90's and CO2 only has a Global Warming Potential rating of 1. GWP is a measure of how much heat a given quantity of a gas will trap in the planet's atmosphere. CO2 with it's GWP of 1 is the big bad, right? Well, turns out there are some refrigerants with GWPs as high as 30,000, and many modern refrigerants are also manufactured using repurposed banned chrlorine-containing hydrocarbons (which caused the ozone hole) which eventually break back down chlorine and fuck the ozone up anyways. The EPA is entirely in the pocket of this industry and, since regulations were drastically loosened in '96, global refrigerant emissions have skyrocketed in a curve that (oddly enough) very closely follows the curve of the global temperature, which many scientists seem baffled is increasing as fast as it is. Well, this is a large part of why that is. And even with this MASSIVE climate movement, ZERO HUMANS SEEM TO KNOW ABOUT IT. I've been talking this shit for years, and nobody fuckin listened until it started getting hotter. Well, now it's time to listen up again: as much as I hate to say it, the extinction of humanity is all but a foregone conclusion. We have plowed right past the point of no return and are only pressing harder on the gas pedal. We whoopsied the planet. Oh well. My guess is it's happened more than once in the universe. Maybe it's even inevitable for intelligent life to consume too much and burn itself out. Nobody will ever know. Nobody can ever change this stuff. But we can choose to let go, be happy and see things differently. It's the ultimate freedom. I truly believe that.","2019-06-30 22:08:41","1","[deleted]","1747926571.5470772","climate crisis","manual"
