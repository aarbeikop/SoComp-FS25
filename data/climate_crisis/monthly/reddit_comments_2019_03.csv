I think the childfree life is great. But anyone who thinks otherwise is totally justified in giving ZERO consideration to global-climate issues. The global climate is a colossally vast system that doesn't respond, at all, to decisions made on the level of an individual family. (As long as the family business isn't burning down entire forests, probably.)

People who base their individual decisions on their effect on the global climate...probably aren't making their decisions rationally. Anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics can see that their individual decisions aren't significant on a global scale. 

But having a family can bring INCREDIBLE joy to people on smaller scales — the personal, extended-family and community scales. So those are the factors that people should consider when making family-planning decisions.  ","2019-03-26 15:09:45","21","DocHarford","1747921634.9873438","climate crisis","manual"

"ejf9ubx","t3_b5qeq8","b5qeq8","climatechange","action-oriented","I want kids. My partner and I aren't serious enough that we have talked much about having kids together, but we both share anxieties about climate change and how difficult the latter half of this century is going to be. I do not plan on having children. The safety window for climate change to be mitigated without massive instability later this century is closing fast and we have taken little to no action to begin moving the needle back on emissions. If more recent models are correct and the climate is more sensitive than we had previously thought (the range from CMIP5) certain mitigation scenarios might already be impossible to achieve.

Now, I'm not a 'doomer'. I don't think civilization is going to end and I don't think that humanity is going to go extinct. I do think that the quality of life in my home country is going to suffer immensely, and isn't likely to improve in my or my potential children's lifetimes. My country is going to desertify and run out of water, and my home town will likely not exist by the time I am old.

I do not delude myself into thinking that my actions have a global impact- they don't. But they do have a local impact in that I won't have to face my future child and have to apologize that their adult life is going to be full of hardship because I chose to bring them into the world.

One could make the argument that life, up until very recently, for every human has been full of hardship- and that is true. But I'm not a subsistence farmer or a member of a hunter-gatherer tribe. I don't need children to work the fields or hunt deer. There is no reason for me to bring a life into this world to have it worse than I have had it, and by all accounts there is nothing that special about me that humanity would benefit from passing it along- I'm remarkably average.","2019-03-26 15:41:40","10","Freeze95","1747921634.991518","climate crisis","manual"
"ejfd5kh","t3_b5qeq8","b5qeq8","climatechange","action-oriented","When I first learned the true extent of how bad things are, I was very against having children. It was always tough though, because it wasn't a financial issue and both our families would love new additions (not to mention if I don't have kids I'm the last of my line, if you will, based on my small extended family). All things being equal, I would probably not have kids both from a personal comfort level - more freedom and money - and an environmental/social level - I think human beings are generally trash, and of course we are likewise trashing our planet. 

&#x200B;

But I've done some thinking and I am changing. First, as a privileged, white American citizen in a stable and developed part of the country, the biggest threats I'm looking at for my children are 1) war, 2) nuclear radiation, 3) some sort of environmental food system collapse, 4) fascist or autocratic government.  The most likely result is more scarcity and some really bad situations in the drier parts of the world or parts that are subject to severe weather. Scarcity doesn't bother me, nor does it bother me to subject my children to scarcity (generally confident first world major city scarcity will not be soviet kulak era stuff). My grandparents brought a depression era identity to my family and we are fine with simple pleasures. On the more dangerous side, war is what every generation in the world, including Americans, dealt with up until the 1970's. The same can be said of autocratic governments; humans have lived under such conditions for 90% of their existence and still produced families and seemed somewhat happy about it, despite life being hard and with less freedom. Nuclear radiation would really suck though! Ultimately, people throughout history have had families in really bad situations, and I don't think I'm that exceptional from those folks. 

&#x200B;

I am also excited to try and raise a new generation with a new mindset and ideals. We have a fairly self-sufficient urban farm, and I am nearing full electrification with solar panels. My activities are based more around substantive items (sports, outdoors, wood instruments) than television or easy pleasure technology. I am also engaged in both traditional politics and the environmental movement to try and blunt some of the impact.

But knowing that my children could be faced with absolute chaos at some point in their lives (hell, even my generation could very well be faced with it before we die)...nope. Not doing it.

I have a raft of reasons to not have children. I could write a book about it.  I thought my mother would interfere with my parenting. I thought and still do that bullying starts in the home. Why would I want to put my trauma onto a child like my mother did to me? And like her mother did to her. Initially I also thought that the Faboks were cursed. I had the power to cause that line to end in my country. But there are some others someone else. I hated my father. But it was just thel trauma talking. He was an alcoholic. He died many years ago.

"eji5poy","t3_b5qeq8","b5qeq8","climatechange","action-oriented","I called this ""the pressure to be green"". It started when I was in university. This was before our city had roll-out recycling bins. The only way to recycle properly would be to ""rent"" or subscribe to a company to come get your stuff once a week. It was very complicated and very expensive. So I was always bothered by it! Then we got roll-out bins and it started to get easier.

Flash forward 7 years to living in a different city. Once again, no roll out bins. But, there was a depot (parking lot with a bunch of different bins in it) down the street from us. Perfect! We did cardboard and paper, household glass, household plastics, metal, etc. Our pop bottles, cans, milk cartons and jugs, etc. we always brought in for the refund money (though the provincial recycling waffled back and forth for years as to whether or not they would accept and/or give refunds for the plastic milk jugs....) I felt good, finally, that I was able to at least do my part successfully.

2 years later, we get roll-out bins in this city. Okay, fine. At first they take everything - even plastic grocery bags! THEN, there is a huge lawsuit in the city I used to live in against the recycling company. Turns out they were taking household glass but didn't have the facilities to actually recycle it, so they were throwing it in the landfill themselves! The lawsuit was because they charge the city by weight for the recycling and the heaviest thing - glass - was being chucked in the garbage on their end. So this was fraud. The same company did the same thing in our city, too.

SO! Now there is no household glass taken in the bins. Okay, fine. I'll take it to the parking lot depot. Nope! City got rid of that after the roll-out bins were provided. So now what?! I literally have nowhere to go to recycle it. 

Also the roll out bins took plastic grocery bags. Amazing! Until they didn't. Turns out China was the biggest buyer/recycler of the bales of plastic bags and the cost was no longer effective for them so they aren't buying our country's plastic bags anymore.

I have often felt so guilty about my abilities to properly recycle. I hear stories about every fish in the sea - even the deepest parts - coming out with plastic in their guts. I even asked on here in a Explain it like I'm 5 post as to how does my garbage, from smack dab in the middle of Canada, end up in the ocean contributing to the garage island, etc. I was told it doesn't. That is probably true. How could it get there by something I physically did? It just goes to the landfill and gets covered up by dirt as it gets too deep. Which is awful and I hate. Does my plastic straw end up in a sea turtle's nose? Probably not mine. But someone's does.

I feel like, not only in this situation, but in many others, there is so little I can do as one person. And that causes me great anxiety. I want to fix it. When there are huge developing countries that are polluting the hell out of the earth around them, how can I personally stop the madness? I want to! We drive a hybrid to help out at least a little bit as well.

When we had our child we ended up using disposable diapers. It was a choice we made based on health reasons. But it hurt! I know how long it takes for those to decompose (depending on the brand, essentially never). Now we are looking at having a second, and I am greatly anxious about using those diapers again. 

Will we need a car bigger than our current hybird? Yep. Most likely. Can we afford another hybrid of the same/different brand? Nope. And not driving is simply not an option where I live. Cannot be done. We measure distance between cities and towns in hours. To get to work, the doctor, etc. you need to drive. Intercity bus routes have all been cancelled. Companies folded or pulled out. No public transit in our city - only taxis.

I sometimes worry that my children will be left in an uninhabitable world after I'm gone. But that isn't stopping me, in the end, from having another. Who knows if the child I have will be the one to turn this thing around? It's not likely, but you never know! Also, with having children, sometimes the desire can cause madness if it is strong enough and not at least attempted. I know. Again, health reasons put it off this long.

I wish there was more clarity and assistance with what to do on a personal level. I visited family in Germany and they had at least 5 different bins in their apartment for recycling every known thing on earth. I wish! But we don't give that kind of effort the means to be practical and successful here.

"ejbmhaq","t3_b3w3di","b3w3di","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","New York introduced a new bill that will expand bounties for recycled goods. However, bills like this are making it less economically feasible for, once flourishing, recycling companies to operate.

>Recycling companies that once turned a tidy profit are now losing money  and sending material to landfills. Local governments are debating  whether to cancel their recycling services or charge residents for what  had always been free. 

These bottle laws, as they are called I believe, make it so that people

>divert valuable materials, like aluminum and PET  plastic, away from kerbside bins to a separate system run primarily by  beverage manufacturers and distributors. This not only creates  inefficiencies (more trucks, more bureaucracy), but also shrinks  revenues for recycling companies left with less valuable materials.  

According to Tom Outerbridge

>of SIMS, which has a long-term contract to process all the metal, glass and plastic collected by New York City’s  sanitation department, says New York’s current bill, introduced in 1982, already cuts the value of every tonne of material SIMS receives by $15-30. He estimates that the governor’s expanded bill could cost another $30 per tonne. 

The suggestion is then to,

>Instead of putting a bounty on materials that recycling companies need  to stay afloat, Eric Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defence Council,  a conservation group, recommends placing redemption values on things  that are difficult to recycle, such as more glass (wine and liquor  bottles, for example), batteries, paints and carpets. Collecting these  materials will not be easy, but at least it will spare local recycling  operators a financial headache.

So yes, this should be a national effort, but the way we approach it should be systematic and efficient (or it wouldn't make sense to do it). The laws need to make recycling easy but also profitable for the recycling companies. Laws must encourage recycling for the businesses and for the average person, which is a fine line. New York is on one extreme but could be learned from on a national level.

"ei8f4b7","t3_azkg1g","azkg1g","conspiracy","unknown","Upon reading this I have to wonder what your motivation is here. Of all the things to be skeptical about, why climate change? Every source I’ve ever read points to humans being the leading cause, to the point where I think trying to refute it makes you look a little silly. And besides, the extent of human involvement and the damage being caused was covered up for decades by people profiting from exploiting the planets resources. Why would it be covered up at all if the real conspiracy was that we were doing *less* damage to the planet? Personally, I’d be incredibly relieved to hear that, and I’d wager that thousands of experts on climate change would be pretty relieved as well. And even if it is all hyperbole designed to frighten us (it is, and I must emphasise this, NOT), the aim is to better the planet and keep it habitable for the only known life in the universe. Do you not think that’s something worth working towards, impending doom or not? Kind of bold, is it not, to refute decades of work from experts on a dice roll that risks all life as we know it? And for what? To be a contrarian? To own the libs? I guess that’d be a pretty sweet own, killing the planet. No coming back from that one.

I don’t care whether you believe in climate change or not, because when it renders the planet uninhabitable, our descendants will die whether we accept or deny it. What I do care about is your attempt at halting progress, trying to talk people out of caring about it. This is our only planet. We are doing irreparable damage to it, and spreading doubt about that fact is not only harmful and regressive, but you’re enabling the assholes doing the majority of the damage.

"eiascey","t3_azkg1g","azkg1g","conspiracy","unknown","The global warming myth has been seized upon by politicians so that they can raise taxation, pseudo scientists so that they can get funding and the media because it is the perfect sensationalist story.

It's amusing how every conference on global warming involves thousands of people clocking up millions of air miles in private jets to luxury resorts.

Climate changes. It's what it does. Climate has changed throughout the history of this planet.

16. “Yesterday’s snow… Because temperatures in the Alps are rising quickly, there will be more precipitation in many places. But because it will rain more often than it snows, this will be bad news for tourists. For many ski lifts this means the end of business.”

18. “Ice, snow, and frost will disappear, i.e. milder winters” … “Unusually warm winters without snow and ice are now being viewed by many as signs of climate change.”

Schleswig Holstein NABU, 10 Feb 2007

19. “Good bye winter… In the northern hemisphere the deviations are much greater according to NOAA calculations, in some areas up to 5°C. That has consequences says DWD meteorologist Müller-Westermeier: When the snowline rises over large areas, the bare ground is warmed up even more by sunlight. This amplifies global warming. A process that is uncontrollable – and for this reason understandably arouses old childhood fears: First the snow disappears, and then winter.”

Die Zeit, 16 Mar 2007

20. “Warm in the winter, dry in the summer … Long, hard winters in Germany remain rare: By 2085 large areas of the Alps and Central German Mountains will be almost free of snow. Because air temperatures in winter will rise more quickly than in summer, there will be more precipitation. ‘However, much of it will fall as rain,’ says Daniela Jacob of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.”
