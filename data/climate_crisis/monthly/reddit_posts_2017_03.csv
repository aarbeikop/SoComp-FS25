"62lrra","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","April protest burnout: Are Democrats sapping their supporters?","April is going to be a busy month for protests:

* 4/15 **[Tax March] (http://taxmarch.org/)**
Demanding Trump release his tax returns and advocating for a fair tax system.
* 4/22 **[March for Science] (https://www.marchforscience.com/)**
Supporting science education and funding.
* 4/29 **[People's Climate Movement] (https://peoplesclimate.org/)**
Working to solve the climate crisis.

In my encounters with other activists there's a worry that Democrats are burning out their supporters with too many protests, too many actions, too much outrage, too many organizations/groups etc... What did the conservative opposition to President Obama teach us about how to keep supporters engaged, active, and motivated? Is there a secret recipe for protest i.e. 20% marches, 30% phone calls, 30% local organizing, 20% community engagement?","2017-03-31 15:14:22","81","391","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/62lrra/april_protest_burnout_are_democrats_sapping_their/","True","FGGF","1747888258.060949","climate crisis","manual"
