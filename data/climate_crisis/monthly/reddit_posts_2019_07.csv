Here's a breakdown and some follow-ups","Tonight's debate, while substantive, was interesting to watch for many reasons. One of which being I decided to track and record the times CNN allowed each of the candidates to respond to questions. These following times are what we observed. The times do not include opening or closing statements, candidates talking over each other, or time spent by the moderators asking questions or follow-ups. I thought this would make for an interesting point of discussion especially in the wake of the debates treating some candidates unfairly. (ie- muting microphones, positing loaded questions, etc.) Please let me know what you think about this breakdown.

Here's some questions sparked in me from tonight's debate:

1 - Would handing immigration through the US embassies perhaps solve the immigration crisis at the border?

2 - Would it make a difference in the rate of domestic terrorism if high crimes such as burning religious/ethnic institutions, mass shootings, and other xenophobic acts targeting groups (rather than individuals \[ie-hate-crimes\]) were met with the death penalty rather than imprisonment?

3 - Could the president or vice-president or chamber leaders physically hold the houses of congress in their chambers until a decision on an issue is made? As in, could those previously stated disallow congress to recess or leave until a decision was reached?

4 - They spoke momentarily about whether the US should consider never using nuclear weapons preemptively. Could it be argued that perhaps our military's conventional capabilities equal or even outmatch the level of devastation a single nuclear strike could inflict, therefore making the preemptive strike conversation unnecessary?

"cg34gg","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I'm a liberal, and other liberals annoy tf out of me","Right now, I live in a very liberal city, though I've lived and traveled throughout the US for work (often in ""flyover country""). We have serious issues in this country: climate change, the immigration crisis and deportations, the trade war with China, escalating tensions with Iran. But I feel like many others are more concerned with virtue signalling and saying the right words than actually deeply exploring these issues.

I can't even talk about this in real life, because every time I try to show that there's nuance, I get jumped on.

Yes, yes, the Trump presidency has polarized everything. But Democrats, if you don't want him to win another term...please...for the love of Christ...stop...being...so...annoying.

* I'm tired of being lectured to. Plastic straws, pronouns, is that new fusion restaurant cultural appropriation?, Uber=bad, and on and on. I wouldn't mind learning more about these issues, but I could do without the shaming for not knowing stuff.
* I'm tired of hearing about ""the squad"" in Congress. They're inexperienced, they're polarizing, but if you disagree with them? You're racist! AOC and Omar seem to be more concerned with fame than anything else, in my opinion. But that's politicians for you.
* I'm tired of social justice being shoehorned into media. I want more characters that are women, that are black, that are gay. But it's obvious when it's a money/attention grab (black Ariel was designed to make Twitter hubbub and get free marketing for Disney), and it just feels fake, pandering.
* I'm tired of cancel culture. It leaves no room for growth or learning. Unless someone is an immediate danger to someone else's safety, they should be given the benefit of the doubt and have space to learn and work on themselves.
* I'm tired of people being afraid to go to ""flyover country."" I'm a minority. I've dealt with racism on some of these trips. But it's not all doom and gloom and white supremacist rallies in Ohio/Kansas/wherever. If you're afraid to leave the big cities and coasts because of all the scary uneducated yokels out there, you're a coward.
* And...I'm tired of people coming up with super special identities so they too can be oppressed. See above, I've dealt with stuff. I don't like seeing people label themselves on social media profiles. It's your choice to define yourself however you want, but it's important to remember that you are more than your race, sexuality, gender, and physical ability.

Blah, blah, blah, you get my drift. Get off my lawn. I'd say I'm center-left, but whenever I disagree with someone further left, they lose their shit. It's a lot of black-and-white thinking. Ironically, you're either with them or against them. Do they not remember the Bush years and how dangerous that kind of thinking was? I may disagree with conservatives, but at least the center-right people agree to disagree for the most part in my experience.","2019-07-21 19:42:11","111","45","0.87","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/cg34gg/im_a_liberal_and_other_liberals_annoy_tf_out_of_me/","True","politicalthrowawayo","1747927952.828657","climate crisis","manual"

Yet I feel totally overwhelmed looking at my financial future. I will be around $170,000 in debt by the time I graduate as a doctor in my field (Not MD, but you might be able to infer). My family isn’t poor enough to qualify for financial assistance, but in no way is able to pay tuition, so I’ve finance everything through loans. I’ve never received scholarships, even though I’ve certainly applied for a lot, and I just can’t help feeling like I made a mistake choosing this career. I “knew” I was signing up for this much debt when I started school, but I didn’t really KNOW what this entailed and how much debt I’d actually be in.

There’s so many things I want to do after I graduate, like work abroad and build wealth, but I have no idea how I’m gonna do that with basically a mortgage right off the bat. How the fuck do other students do this? Moreover, how is this good for the country if my generation is and will be drowning in debt? I understand that billionaires and the super rich run the US, but fuck me, aren’t there supposed to be people buying homes and other purchases to keep this whole shit running? Probably won’t matter when climate change fucks all over anyway.

"civmx9","vegan","unknown","We plan to turn the ENTIRE world vegan, starting with UK","We, **ANIMAL REBELLION**, are a new decentralised volunteer organisation and we are planning to bring together over 10k of volunteers and activists in a major action in London, UK (in partnership with Extinction Rebellion) **to stop animal agriculture and fishing** in the UK and other countries.

This is a one of a kind opportunity for us vegans to work together with environmentalists (overcoming any differences) to strongly challenge the current food production system based on animal abuse and destruction of nature. We are focusing on the system change (end meat/fish subsidies, slash agricultural impact on climate change, stop oceans depletion), but we expect this to start massive personal change as well, due to media focus  attracting exponential growth of vegan population (as a result of education, myths busting etc.).

**WHAT?** We will go out on the streets and exercise our human right to a peaceful protest and civil disobedience (think Suffragettes, civil rights, Gandhi). We will demand the system change and we will educate people about veganism in the process.

**HOW?** By joining forces with about 20 animal rights organisations and also influencers and celebrities and partnering with Extinction Rebellion - a successful environmental movement that attracted a lot of attention to the issue of climate crisis and obliteration of biodiversity. It is acknowledged that fighting climate change and reverting biodiversity loss is impossible without changing agricultural system on the land and fishing practices on the sea.

**WHERE?** Initially in London, UK, but we hear Canada also wants to join.

**WHY?** Because animals!

**WHEN?** 07 October will be the start of our two weeks of protest.

&#x200B;

If you want to see the world turn vegan soon, volunteer with us -  [https://actionnetwork.org/forms/animal-rebellion-volunteer-application-form/](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/animal-rebellion-volunteer-application-form/)

&#x200B;

If you want to help but unable, then spread the word that the change IS coming and coming soon!

Doesn't that sound cool?

* Livestock are not to blame for the climate crisis!
* No more feedlots! Let them eat grass!
* Cows can pull carbon out of the atmosphere by eating!
* And so much more!

Try not to notice that the word ""sustainable"" never appears in the article. The author admits that the price of meat would have to go up, but only by $2 to $4 per pound, and does not mention that this method couldn't produce meat for everyone who now eats it in the amounts they are used to eating. ""Regenerative agriculture"" could only work if everyone agrees to drastically cut production and pay a lot more. Sure, that will happen.","2019-07-23 20:19:26","4","2","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/cgxvsy/can_meat_actually_save_the_planet_no_no_it_cannot/","True","RunVeganRunLonger","1747928370.6489012","climate crisis","manual"
