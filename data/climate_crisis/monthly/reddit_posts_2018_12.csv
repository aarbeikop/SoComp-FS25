"ab0nkd","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","Why are some groups of people so blatantly in denial about climate change? And how did they so successfully convince people that climate change is a hoax?","I'm looking for an answer along the lines of the documentary and book ""Merchants of Doubt.""


http://sonyclassics.com/merchantsofdoubt/

So in advance I'm respectfully requesting not to receive answers that pile on the cynicism along the lines of ""people are stupid"" and ""the world is run by special interests"" sort of thing. I’m looking for thoughtful and educated answers, not one liners.

I know that special interests are involved. Switching to renewables poses an existential crisis for coal mine owners and the fossil fuel industry in general. That's clear.

But countries such as Saudi Arabia have aggressively pursued solar energy, and even ""sunny"" Germany has had days where its solar power has powered the entire nation for a day.

So how exactly did it happen that entities in the US particularly have succeeded in generating such distrust in climate science whereas for much of the rest of the world it is a no brainer?","2018-12-30 22:35:44","6","10","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ab0nkd/why_are_some_groups_of_people_so_blatantly_in/","True","gomi-panda","1747917802.1642601","climate crisis","manual"

* Washing a lot of dishes and utensils vs. single-use plasticware for a party
* Washing with a bidet vs. using wet wipes


Bearing in mind: 1) The issue of climate change is becoming more dire, 2) There are many parts of the world still suffering from drought, and 3) Water isn't an unlimited resource and will eventually run out. [In fact, over 844 million people lack access to safe water.](https://water.org/our-impact/water-crisis/) 

Waste water is still a type of waste. The average person does not live in a home that has a waste and groundwater recycling system. 


Which one is more economical? (If any) Is this a legitimate comparison? An Either/Or?","2018-12-05 20:14:31","8","8","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/a3g35a/using_water_vs_contributing_to_waste/","True","sourpatchkidj","1747918141.029697","climate crisis","manual"
