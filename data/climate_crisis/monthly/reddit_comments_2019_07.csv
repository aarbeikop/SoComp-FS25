"eu0y996","t3_ce91o0","ce91o0","climatechange","action-oriented","The obvious critique here is that these two pieces of evidence, alone, just offer evidence of correlation. And most correlations aren't evidence of *causation*, which I think is usually what people want to argue about on the topic of climate change.

And causation is extremely difficult to pin down in very complex systems where the effects of individual influences are very hard to isolate and examine. To establish causation, you really need to conduct and extensively replicate hypothesis tests under controlled conditions.

We can't currently control the planetary climate sufficiently to conduct hypothesis tests involving human influences only. Our climate observations are always ""contaminated"" by natural influences — some of which operate at colossal scales. 

The problem with relying on correlations in complex systems is that it's very hard to know how stable they are. This is a classic problem in finance, especially when you look at complex phenomena like an entire market or an entire economy. Even very strong correlations are considered rough and approximate, and multi-decade assumptions about correlations are often a weak point in predictive models. 

The correlation problem in climate is especially acute because atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase relatively steadily, while global temp increases are not at all steady when examined annually. Smoothing is an important part of establishing correlations in global-temp data — but smoothing can be a weak point too. 

TL;DR: Your data provide a beginning of an argument that a correlation exists. But proving that the correlation will be stable for decades or centuries into the future, and that it constitutes causation, requires a much more full-featured analysis. An analysis that really needs to include hypothesis tests under controlled conditions someday, although for now that day remains very far off.","2019-07-17 09:50:51","4","DocHarford","1747927284.520798","climate crisis","manual"

If you want to know what influences my lack of panic, here are some things to note.

&#x200B;

The planet is at 288 kelvin, within the margins of error.  The sun is a variable star with a 0.1% variation.  0.1% of 288 is 2.88°C.  It is well known that deviations in magnetic flux affects cloudiness, and clouds GREATLY affect the albedo of the earth.  Clouds are classified in the GCMs poorly, if at all, and are considered a positive feedback.  Clouds are more complex than this, and the relationship between increased solar influx, changes in solar magnetic flux, changes in terrestrial magnetic flux, cosmic rays, increased GHG effect, increased evaporation rate, increased humidity, increased convection, increasing levels of cloudiness and albedo are not well understood or modeled.

We know (not suspect, know) that there are alternating periods of warming and cooling. These warm periods have names: the Holocene Climactic Optimum, the Older Peron period, the Minoan Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period, the  Medieval Warm Period.  We have cold periods, the Younger Dryas, the Middle Bronze Age Cold Epoch, the  Bond event with the Iron Age Cold Epoch, the Dark Age, the Little Ice Age.  As these warm and cold periods oscillate, we get much warmer or much colder, and it is not clear that the northern and southern hemispheres react at the same amount during the same times in any of them.

Almost all of today's claimed warmth is in the northern hemisphere, and most of it is confined to the high latitudes.   When ""global warming"" is mainly about 30% of the planet, but the climate scientists dismiss the LIA because they don't want to admit that it was 100% global, we have bad science.

Nearly all of the current warm anomaly in the last 30 years has been due to data manipulation (adjustments) and not due to actual readings.  The data manipulation has ""smoothed the curve"" to show a better correlation to the increase in atmospheric CO2, or even just to human emissions.  In fact, t[he adjustments, the current curve minus the raw observations,](http://climateilluminated.com/media/data_tampering/Slide13.JPG) tells this story better than anything. 

&#x200B;

It is clear to me that we have warmed, and it is probable that humans have influenced the temperature.  It is NOT clear that the warming will accelerate out of control, that we're warmer than we have ever been, or that there is any sort of crisis.  What does seem to be clear is that the whole global warming scare is designed to scare people into giving more control to unelected bureaucrats and [allowing them to reshape the socioeconomic landscape of the planet](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/the-green-new-deal-was-never-about-climate-change-its-just-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-excuse-to-destroy-americas-economy).","2019-07-17 12:24:42","0","deck_hand","1747927284.532094","climate crisis","manual"

Researchers have placed food inside a basket (something a monkey would want to eat, obviously) and let the monkey try to get it out through the gaps and openings in the basket. Monkeys apparently only think of the now rather than the long term sustainability of not eating whatever’s in the basket for the sake of using your hand to its full potential.

I've run plenty of races, including the New York City marathon and many 5ks, with big tubs of water and paper cups. While we could reduce the cups, at least a standard exists with less waste than Jaden's cartons.

I compare his cartons with the minimum waste we could use, not the maximum.

I know people are pointing out the issue of running a company and making money off this race while looking like a charity, as well as replacing the plastic with a different kind of plastic instead of paper. But the bigger problem with the headline is Jaden. Will Smith has 1000 times more money than jaden, and what money Jaden does have came from Will spending his money to prop Jaden up. When ""Will and Jaden Smith"" do something, it's Will that is doing it. and all Will SMith is doing is owning a company that someone else manages because he has a shitton of money.

Jaden is just their in the headline to grab attention because nobody would click on ""Norm Middleman, actually does the work of selling water, and some celebrities get part of his profit""","2019-07-18 18:08:28","1","BackslidingAlt","1747928256.749156","climate crisis","manual"

"evbq4e9","t3_civmx9","civmx9","vegan","unknown","I mean it sounds great but I have some serious doubts here. People already have problems with changing their consumer habits and lifestyle even though they support climate activists and know their impact.
It also sounds a lot like you want to force people when you say you will turn the world vegan. I know it's not how you plan to do it but again this will not go well with public opinion.
Another concern I have is that your partnership with extinction rebellion is too obvious. People will now think that you and ER are the same group and will thus use arguments against veganism also against ER. Again this might turn people away.
I think it would be better to use a different symbol. There are already a lot of hard working animal right groups out there that basically want a vegan world, join forces with them and try to use the climate movement as a catalysator to get people interested in veganism. But please be careful to not hinder or slow down the work of ER. The climate movement has enough enemies and hardships as it is.
Good luck to you though and thanks for being an activist.  I hope we live in a vegan world one day.","2019-07-29 08:25:06","2","Griffonguy","1747928315.063738","climate crisis","manual"
