From what I've read, Texas is both increasing its fossil fuel production and its renewable production. I think before he became Energy Secretary Rick Perry was celebrating Wind Energy in the state as the future. It seems like a complicated mix of business, politics and energy.

"dxis4yt","t3_8cxq6b","8cxq6b","futurology","unknown","We got this question from Doug on the ICN Facebook page and wanted to crosspost our answer here:  

I think this notion of a ""middle ground"" in America's ""national conversation ... on what is causing Earth's climate to change"" is highly problematical. 

What is causing the Earth's climate to change is human activities, principally the burning of fossil fuels, aggravated by agriculture and deforestation, which has drastically increased the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the acidity of the oceans. 

That is simply a FACT, and there is no ""middle ground"" between the FACTS of climate science and the LIES of the fossil fuel industry's propaganda. And there can be no hope of solving a problem if we refuse to face the FACTS about what is causing it.","2018-04-17 17:51:03","5","InsideClimateNews","1747906811.0449688","climate crisis","manual"

How much of anti-Climate Change stances are political posturing masquerading as faux-science?

"dxw9102","t3_8cxq6b","8cxq6b","futurology","unknown","A think there are three main reasons why those of us on the right just don't take climate claims seriously. First, alarmists like Al Gore make wild predictions which are backed by your climate ""experts"", then these wild predictions don't pan out, which makes you all look like alarmists at best and outright lying fear mongers looking to make a quick buck at worst. Second, even if the climate is changing, the needs to be a more conclusive link between human activity and global warming. The argument was that carbon emissions cause temperatures to rise, but then the facts didn't fit the narrative and the problem was renamed climate instability. Before all of this, it was a global cooling scare. Again, it just looks bad when you all do this. It's inconsistent, and it doesn't fit with the explanations which were given, so when someone else just says ""earth is unstable, climates have always changed, just look at history"" we can't help but believe them over you. Honestly, I half expect one of you to start predicting global floods every time it starts to rain. Third, you need more reasonable solutions. Having Al Gore flying around in his private jet releasing massive carbon emission while he talks about how everyone else needs to cut back on fossil fuels is hypocritical, but doesn't even compare to your other failures. Look at low energy bulbs, which leak mercury into landfills. Look at cash for clunkers, which created more carbon emissions making new cars than driving the old ones would have while helping corporate cronies and hurting the working poor by removing access to affordable transportation. If carbon emissions were the problem, why not use some of that carbon credit money lining liberal pockets to build green energy plants and carbon scrubbers to clean the air? Honestly, I can't get on board because of who is dropping the ball on the concept, not the concept itself, and I have far more faith in the free market to fix these issues. Just look at vertical agriculture solving the issue of food production regardless of climate. If water shortages are an issue, why not build water desalinators and purifiers powered by tidal energy. I'm tired of doomsayers. We fix problems, not bite our nails and cry. You name any issue climate change can bring, I'll list of two or three solutions the free market could provide at a health profit.","2018-04-24 17:31:05","1","[deleted]","1747906811.060765","climate crisis","manual"
