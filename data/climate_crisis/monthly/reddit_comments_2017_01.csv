And as long as it carries on the anti-immigration and eurosceptic parties will only grow stronger over time.","2017-01-06 16:09:23","68","scytheavatar","1747885341.529114","climate crisis","manual"
"dc2wji8","t3_5ma00e","5ma00e","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","My guess it will peak during 2017 and go down from here. 

1. The European economy is showing signs of some serious recovery. populism feeds of economic insecurity.

2. The Refugee crisis might not be totaly averted but we are no longer seeing the enormous flights on which the governments had little to no control.

3. Populist parties get into power. I read somewhere that a right populism party in Sweden or Finland had lost 1/3 on its polls since they had gotten into government. Promising things to people is easy. Actually delivering on those promises is not.

4. Brexit is kind of looking like a shit show, as is the incoming Trump administration. Some more moderate populist voters might be scared of by it.

5. Dog that caught the car kind off. A lot of the populism in Europe is centered around the EU. After the British referendum some of my friends who were also anti-EU softened their stance. Once something becomes a realization, things lose their romantic view. (I am not a native english speaker and find this argument hard to write.) 

It is kind off a: Oh shit right voting changes things and ultimately I am not that sure I want everything to change that drastically.","2017-01-06 16:27:25","38","Sjoerd920","1747885341.532625","climate crisis","manual"

"dc3p7kk","t3_5ma00e","5ma00e","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","I guess it depends on who wins in France, because france is the second most important country in the EU after Germany. So my bet is if Fillon wins there is the possibility people will vote for the center rights. If Fillon is able to improve the immigration issues in France he could even become the moral leader of the EU but the nationalist will continue to promise they can solve the issue faster. If Le Pen wins nationalism will accelerate through all Europe like a virus. The problem with nationalism is once you let that genie out is hard to put him back in the lamp, so this will keep growing and growing like a snow ball. Now is the Muslims but couldn't the Polish be a problem too? So this will balkanize Europe again. Creating a bit of chaos and uncertainty to the region, the most affected countries will be Mediterranean and the baltic nations. 

The nationalist phenomenon is also happening in the Middle East big time but in that zone the countries are unifying. The borders imposed by the US and Europe are becoming obsolete. The region is steadily coming together into factions defined by religion, economic interests, and kinships. So be careful with what you wish. ""You don't know what you've got until it's gone"" will be the morale of this story. ","2017-01-07 01:54:57","14","[deleted]","1747885341.537096","climate crisis","manual"

"dc6y4t2","t3_5ma00e","5ma00e","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Finns Party has now been 1,5 years one of the ruling parties in the government with the right wing party and agrarian party. They have lost half of their support in polls compared to the elections from 17,7% to 9%. Also the Finnish version of Breitbart a website called in Finnish ""What the fuck magazine"" has had some negative stories about some of the Finns Party members. Though this is mostly because the website owner is Russian and the site is very pro-russian where as the most prominent members of the Finns Party are quite anti-russian.

So atleast in Finland the party got into power, did not deliver its promises and is now losing support.","2017-01-09 10:07:59","2","[deleted]","1747885341.54538","climate crisis","manual"
