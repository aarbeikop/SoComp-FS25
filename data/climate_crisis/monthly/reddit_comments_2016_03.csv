Unfortunately, I believe that the task of addressing this in a compelling manner, supportive of  the candidate's proposals with tangible and reasonable strategies  that, in-fact, clearly illustrates how Bernie will pay for these arguably dramatic changes. Anything short of this serves the ultimate downfall of his candidacy or any realistic chance of winning the election.

There is simply no way Bernie's ideas can truly be realized without remaining naively latched on to truly hyper-aspirational and unrealistic expectations—and absolutely no recognizable plan. I've scourrd the internet for weeks searching for a legitimate attempt to detail the financial aspects of these core Sanders positions in such a way that paves a reasonable path to actualizing these very lofty and sweeping changes to long established, core national economic structures.

So far I'm unable to find any comprehensive examples of a non-partisan (or even partisan for that matter) breakdown demonstrating actual costs and numbers, and the practical measures required to implement such financially dependent changes.

Perhaps the argument could be made that no other candidate has been required to detail their proposed changes with such transparency, which is very true. However, if the Sanders ""revolution"" is expected to be taken seriously, or even objectively, I believe this undertaking is incumbent upon Sanders (preferably),  and if not him, then doesn't his unified constituency hold the mandate?

I find Sanders' ideas to be impractical, prohibitively ambitious and perhaps even somewhat naive. As a somewhat seasoned voter—one who does not claim a party alliance and who has traditionally bucked the notion of conformity and status quo all my life—I really struggle with this major disconnect. For me, it's a deal killer.

I honestly do not consider myself closed minded about this either, I don't think. I'm actually seeking out persuasive arguments [that aren't loaded with rhetoric or bombastic social underpinnings], however it's not easy

Someone? Persuade me, convince me with facts or even mildly speculative improvisation, procured it has teeth.

The convention is already a quasi runoff system without mandatory drop out rules; the candidate with the fewest votes on the first ballot doesn't have to drop out but after delegates become unbound on the 2nd & 3rd ballots many jump ship.
