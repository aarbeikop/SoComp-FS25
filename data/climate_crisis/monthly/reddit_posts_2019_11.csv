I am getting a bit tired of this generational crap that’s going on. Like all “Boomers” are middle-class college-educated twats who stole all the wealth and resources from later generations with no ethics and ‘Millennials’ are self-absorbed, lazy, entitled, avocado toast munching, snowflakes. Neither of those ‘generalisations’ are true. The world at the moment is a shit place, there are rebellions left right and center. Climate change is happening. Governments and countries are becoming over nationalistic with politics becoming more polarising with each election.  The world is in crisis and people are wasting time fighting between each other about which generation is to blame and which generation is the most ignorant. This needs to stop. All generations have their part to play in making this world a better, safer, more liveable and more egalitarian place. People are wasting time fighting the wrong arguments, trying to score points over others, instead of looking for common ground and working together for solutions. Nobody will listen or take you seriously if all you do is denigrate and apportion blame to the other party. And while you're all so busy one-upping each other on snipey comments the world is on fire. It doesn’t matter anymore how the fire started, what matters is the fire is raging and getting bigger and the question is how we are going to put it out before it’s too late?","2019-11-23 02:11:24","6","3","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/e0bg6d/enough_with_the_generational_bullshit_already/","True","Badmother10","1747933839.140498","climate crisis","manual"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition: This group calls for the expansion of civil rights and liberties for illegal aliens; laments that illegal aliens in America are commonly subjected to “worker exploitation”; supports tuition-assistance programs for illegal aliens attending college; and characterizes the Patriot Act as a “very troubling” assault on civil liberties.

&#x200B;

National Immigration Forum: Opposing the enforcement of present immigration laws, this organization urges the American government to “legalize” en masse all illegal aliens currently in the United States who have no criminal records, and to dramatically increase the number of visas available for those wishing to migrate to the U.S. The Forum is particularly committed to opening the borders to unskilled, low-income workers, and immediately making them eligible for welfare and social service programs.

She asked me if I had any recommendations because I'm pretty much the only vegan she knows, and I'm into environmentalistm and what not.

Problem is, I don't know where to begin to find videos like this for kids, that will promote veganism and other positive lifestyle changes to reduce consumption, cut down emissions etc. I don't have kids and don't know the first thing about what younger kids watch these days.

Anyone got any video recommendations or YouTube links or whatever for 7 and 8 year old kids, preferably animated?","2019-11-07 17:35:13","3","4","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/dt12md/video_recommendations_for_environmentalvegan/","True","R_a_d_a_g_a_s_T","1747934155.033237","climate crisis","manual"
