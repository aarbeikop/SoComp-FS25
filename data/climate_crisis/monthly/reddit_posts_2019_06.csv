"bxjt00","sustainability","action-oriented","Having children and climate crisis","My wife and I have been talking about having kids for a while and we have been back and forth on the issue.  I am really struggling with the worries and anxieties of bringing children into a world that appears to be facing such uncertainty. But other than that, i am looking forward to this new chapter in our life. 

Im not looking for facts or data, or alternatives (adoption) , but wondering about how other people have been able to cope with the decision to have kids (despite it being not the best for the planet).   Any advice or resources that have helped?","2019-06-06 17:59:20","23","15","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bxjt00/having_children_and_climate_crisis/","True","mekju905","1747926228.145314","climate crisis","manual"

"c3p3ut","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","The left's failure to prevent the civil breakdown of our democracy is pissing me off beyond belief. I hate them SO much right now.","Go check the [/r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics) feed today. [/r/worldnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews). [/r/news](https://www.reddit.com/r/news).

Checked them? Saw that nasty horrible shit about [how we have concentration camps in the U.S. now,](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-unimaginable-reality-of-american-concentration-camps) [and how they're imprisoning children with no water or toilets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJVqs_mhOA4) [to the point where children are being sickened and killed from the conditions](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/four-severely-ill-migrant-babies-hospitalized-after-lawyers-visited-border-patrol-facility_n_5d0d3bbce4b07ae90d9cfe4f?guccounter=1)? How nothing's being done to stop it? And worst of all, not one single person other than me has been seriously talking about how we desperately face the need to violently overthrow the fascist fucks behind all of this crap. I've been reading this mind-numbing, horrific shit for a while now, and every day I witness the events unfolding and, as someone who actually bothered to pay attention in history class, see what's coming, I am getting angrier and angrier and angrier.

The most I've seen people talk about doing anything to resolve the matter are pickets that will be ignored, passive resistance that will be overpowered or ignored -- all woefully ineffective, all a complete display of the absolute failure of the left and its deluded ideology in the face of a real crisis. If you don't believe me, go read the comments in the Reddit posts I ripped the links from -- there are tons. Nothing but milquetoast condemnations of the camps and no real call for civil rebellion in the face of it.

They still think that we should be kind to Trump supporters in the wake of the fact that they're committing genocide, guaranteeing we can never properly hold the fascist right accountable for their actions.

They are solely pushing for passive resistance and pickets, which they know won't actually do anything to physically prevent [ICE from raiding and kidnapping 2000 Hispanic families tomorrow](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/ice-raids-targeting-migrant-families-slated-to-start-sunday-in-major-us-cities/2019/06/21/f2936318-942e-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_term=.f6b5d12a4fa8).

And honestly, I believe that's the intent. Because they hold a mindset that says that we should not morally label or judge people based on their actions but that we should treat everyone the same, and positively, and that it is always wrong to use violence to stop people from doing horrific shit to each other no matter how great the moral imperative or how horrific the results. They'll morally condemn anyone who tries to challenge them, and shame them into silence. They'll prevent anybody who isn't enamored in their bullshit from garnering support, organizing, and rebelling on their own by convincing everyone else that the use of such tactics are always wrong, preventing anyone from going around them and doing the right thing. And it won't fucking matter to them what happens as a result -- it won't matter if the fascists that have taken over this country succeed in wiping out most of Latin and South America in a brutal act of genocide that will make Hitler look like a saint in comparison, it won't matter to them when the fascists start using nuclear weapons, it won't matter to them when the fascists successfully kill climate change legislation in the U.S. effectively dooming the majority of the population of our species, they will still place their ideology above our best interests and well-being consequences be damned, and now I will forever hate them for what they've done.

Had they just accepted that they were fundamentally wrong about their worldview, about how people truly are, and supported an uprising against the fascists 15-20 years ago, we could've put a stop to this bullshit back in the 00's when Dubya started his takeover of Iraq. We could've stopped the Republicans from rigging the 2000 election and stealing the presidency from Al Gore. We could've made it so that Trump would never have been a viable candidate in the first place. But here we are, facing a civil breakdown of our society, with concentration camps, and the blame largely lays on the left for their behavior. They are deluded, and they are toxic.

Until I hear real, serious calls for violent overthrow of the fascist state from them, and real, serious attempts to organize raids to free the children being imprisoned and likely murdered in our *concentration camps,* they will not get my vote, they will not get my support, and they will only get my hate and my condemnation. If you think the way they do, you are evil, period, full stop.

I fundamentally don't give a fuck if I get downvoted or if my account gets banned as a result of me saying this. The fact that I have to even worry about reprisal for saying these words proves my point.

We desperately need a violent revolution in the United States of America to stop our shitty fascist government from committing genocide against our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors' *children,* and if that's a controversial position to you then you're a piece of shit and I only wish someone had invented a device that allows people to punch each other in the face over the internet, because goddamn, could I use one right now.

**TL;DR The left is stopping us from organizing and engaging in effective resistance against the fascists currently committing genocide in the U.S. right now because they are prioritizing nonviolence over doing the right thing and I wish I could line them up and choke all of them for that. I hate them so fucking much right now.**","2019-06-22 12:25:08","1","19","0.53","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/c3p3ut/the_lefts_failure_to_prevent_the_civil_breakdown/","True","level1mallow","1747926560.409208","climate crisis","manual"
"c7ggzd","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I (33, m) cried today for the first time in 10+ years","This was just minutes ago. Also this is the first time I post on here. So I hope this is OK. I still feel the tears on my cheek. I was just on the phone with my mother. 

The past few days I started listening to podcasts and read articles related to the climate crisis, and several scenarios that will expect us. Right now it is hot outside where I live. This is what triggered the research. But scientists agree that just a few years from now we wish for the temperatures that currently set new records. Within the next decade 40C (104F) will sound like the salvation here in Europe. A majority on Subreddits like /r/collapse believe the end of our society is near and unavoidable. Then there are informative ones like /r/Futurology and more progress centred ones like /r/ClimateActionPlan. But all have in common that they agree we re in a big trouble. 

I was always a guy that believed in not much than science. So there s no God I can turn to. just raw, unadorned facts. And with all that new information, my appetite vanished. I could not sleep anymore afzer just 4 hours of sleep. I puked several times yesterday and today. Mostly water. And I just generally didn't know what to do. Since it looks really really dire for all of us. 

The thing that gets me most, is that helplessness. So I started brainstorming already. And since my mother was always interested in the environment, I had to call her and be honest about my feelings.

"c2ecbm","futurology","unknown","Would the socioeconomic system collapse if we stop *all* carbon emissions *right now*?","Or would it just undergo a radical transformation?

It is surely useful to define the difference between socioeconomic collapse and radical transformation.

(My 2 cents regarding this: If we get to keep a decent rate of literacy, I am going to call it just transformation. If literacy drops at dark ages level, I'm going to call it collapse.)

Things are happening sooner than expected. Climate change is now renamed climate crisis and will soon be renamed climate collapse.

The sooner we start this conversation, the better.

What do you think?

Edit: When I say all carbon emissions, I don't mean the ones from breathing, but literally everything else.
