You can't legislate more water into existence, and California should be in charge of the kinds of local measures to ration & manage the water we have, not the federal government.  As long as he knows there's a drought and is willing to provide federal assistance if California needs it, that's all I want.  

I'd be willing to bet the only thing most people in this thread know is, ""There's a drought, yo.""   ","2016-06-01 22:08:13","3","JaiC","1747875088.345376","climate crisis","manual"

"d3r9nqi","t3_4lxbu3","4lxbu3","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","California's water crisis is a lot more complicated than many people in this thread seem to think. For example, birth defects have been a growing cause of concern as much as the drought. Not only that, the issue of the drought isn't one of ""How do we get more water,"" it's how do we get people to stop bottling our water and selling it, how do we contain the water that we previously wanted to get rid of as run-off, how do we allocate the water we have in a way that allows the continued success of family-run farms. The water issue in California is not something you can learn off-hand while campaigning, it is something that takes time to understand and more importantly propose solutions. Both of these things should not be rushed and I applaud Bernie for admitting as much. For everyone rushing to criticize him for not having the answers, I don't need him to have all the answers, I merely need him to facilitate pathways that will allow people who know the *right* answers to implement them.","2016-06-01 02:54:06","1","backflipwafflez","1747875088.359974","climate crisis","manual"

"d3rdj2j","t3_4lxbu3","4lxbu3","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","What are we supposed to be discussing here, a twitter post that doesn't even state or link to the question that was asked? I'm not saying it was, but something like ""Bernie, how will you address the effect of the water crisis on the hotel laundry industry?"" could easily meet the standard presented in this twitter post and would be something entirely sensible for him to respond in this way to. Even beyond that, he isn't directly quoted here and there are a lot of perfectly valid responses that can be summed up as ""It needs more study.""

That being said I'll restate what several here have already attempted to - If someone is running for President and claims to have a detailed solution for every issue in every State already, they are either stupid or a liar. California's drought, like most issues is complex and requires a lot of people at the State, local, and Federal level to make hard decisions and no President can ""solve"" it.","2016-06-01 04:55:44","1","SmokeSerpent","1747875088.36251","climate crisis","manual"

You can't campaign in California and give that as an answer if you need to win the state.  This is not a minor issue, but a major problem in the biggest state in the union.
