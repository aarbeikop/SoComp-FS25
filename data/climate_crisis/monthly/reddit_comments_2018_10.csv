Most people can't do anything about it, and one major political party believes that any effort to ameliorate climate change would reduce the near-term profits of their most valuable donors, so they have a financial incentive to prevent any action from being taken.

droughts  
deadly heatwaves in large parts of the world

There is a big difference between what climate science has evidence for and what politicians and public talking heads say about it. The climate apocalypse has been predicted and then not occurred for decades now. It has also been used as a political motive for the Democratic party as a way to claim thier policies are required. This takes the scientific pursuit into the political arena which creates a fight. ","2018-10-29 15:34:45","1","mrp3anut","1747914930.747999","climate crisis","manual"

All we can do is a sort of quiet rebellion against this by recycling everything we can, composting everything we can, driving less, using less electricity, less plastic etc. Most people don't want to do any of those things because they are more work.

I have been looking for support groups for people who care but there seem to be none. That's why I left FB (well one reason). Maybe I should look on here. ","2018-10-29 15:01:34","0","OGGalaxyGirl","1747914930.750754","climate crisis","manual"

According to this computer that turning point for all this is 2020. I honestly think all this stuff has been in motion for since the 1950s I guess. People are not going to stop having kids. What's going to happen is that our first world is going to turn into a second world and eventually a third world until enough of the population dies. Then the Earth will balance itself out.

The truth is that if you have another talent that you can live off of, I would *highly* recommend that you get out of that industry and deal with sane people.  The entertainment industry is going to follow the lead of either Hollywood or Broadway, and both of the industries are so far to the left that they actively shun anyone who doesn't hold to their far-left views.

One thing you might consider doing is getting your teaching certification, and teach acting.  Almost every high school has a drama program, and your experience would at least give you something to offer.

There's an outside chance you might find a conservative-leaning production company where you would be welcome.  A lot of them are religious in nature, so you'll be dealing with ardent followers (as a Christian myself, I see nothing wrong with that), and you could always start a tutoring program wherever you live, training young people in how to be better actors.

If you can get out now, I would greatly recommend it.  You'll be blackballed the moment you're found out anyway. You'll be living a sane lifestyle, not judged on your looks, and generally be less stressed from what I've heard of the entertainment industry.","2018-10-29 18:00:13","3","thatrightwinger","1747915210.9083982","climate crisis","manual"
"e8ogwic","t3_9sf9dm","9sf9dm","Conservative","unknown","I was a professional sound designer and mix engineer for theatre, and also ended up the production director at a theatre complex in NYC.

Unfortunately, I don't see the theatre community coming to its senses anytime soon.  And I don't mean that in the sense that theatre people would become conservative, I mean that they would begin to be even ok with the fact that a conservative person exists.

When I was in theatre, I bought in to the leftism.  Shortly before leaving my theatre job for a job at a different kind of company, I began to come to my senses.  2 years after leaving theatre, I have lost nearly all of my theatre friends because they could not accept my changed views.  Last week at a bar, an old friend of mine called me a Nazi apologist because I refused to agree that ""Republicans want women to be property.""

I'd find a way to look for work in another industry, otherwise you have to keep your views to yourself and not engage, which gets harder and harder as even working on a production can now involve required equity workshops and diversity training.  

You will get blackballed the moment you are found out.","2018-10-29 19:02:11","3","My_Sp00n_is_too_big","1747915210.910263","climate crisis","manual"
"e8oee0v","t3_9sf9dm","9sf9dm","Conservative","unknown","I don't anymore, but I used to. I did marching band and indoor drumline in high school (late 90s-early 00s) and then after graduation marched in drum and bugle corps and independent indoor drumlines, going on to teach drumlines for a good 7 years before I joined the Army and got out of that. Even back then I could see the writing on the wall. I didn't even start looking into real careers until I was in my mid-20s. Going from being all about drumming, music, teaching, etc to being a soldier and getting into high-end security/law enforcement related stuff was a big change, but overall it has been a great move and a much better environment for people of our beliefs. There are people who totally switch careers many times in life. My dad was a firefighter for 25 years, retiring as our city's Fire Marshal. He then got a nursing degree and was a nurse for 10 years. Then he went back to school again and now he's a math teacher. It's never too late to switch jobs, even if you think you're well into ""adulthood"" and you ""should"" be on a single path for the rest of your life.

Unfortunately, performing arts (and even art and design) are extremely left. It just comes with the territory, but you already know that, so I'm just preaching to the choir.

You might want to look into Ben Shapiro's book Primetime Propeganda (hopefully this is the correct book). He basically went into agencies in Hollywood and was easily able to get producers and directors to say that they would discriminate based on a person being conservative. He might have some advice in their for you or you might be able to find an answer there for yourself. ","2018-10-29 17:55:10","1","[deleted]","1747915210.91379","climate crisis","manual"
