"d2j02nh","t3_4gmsd1","4gmsd1","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","As for the actual voting percentages in the primary states between now and June 7th, I think there will be two competing effects as a result of Sanders' new tone/outlook on the race (i.e. promoting issues, not necessarily competing for the nomination).

1) Reduced turnout for Bernie, as *some* of his supporters become discouraged as they realize that he cannot win.

2) Reduced turnout for Hillary, as her supporters become complacent, thinking that her nomination is basically a done deal, and they don't need to take time out of their day to vote. 

I think that these two effects will roughly cancel each other out, therefore having little effect on the final results.  But overall turnout will suffer. 

As for the larger picture, I don't think it really matters very much that Bernie stays in.  I don't think the party platform will be any different whether he were to drop out now or stay in until the convention.  I don't think that Hillary is hurt or helped very much by him staying in until the convention.  However, I **do** think that Hillary is helped by Bernie lightening his tone (or rather, she is no longer being hurt by him, because he is lightening his tone).  

From here on out, it will basically be Hillary campaigning against Trump, and Bernie campaigning for progressive issues, without throwing any shade at each other.  They're effectively no longer competing against each other, because they're no longer competing for the same thing.

Hillary will have the majority and a lot of delegates from these states that are part of the Democratic Party, are not going to vote with Bernie against Hillary now that they realize she is the nominee.

This is typical Bernie making himself bigger and better than he actually is. Truth is, he lost. He lost the popular vote, he lost the delegate vote, he lost the super delegate race, and he will also lose at the convention where he will still have a minority of votes.

But let's say just for the sake of argument that he can get a few planks in the platform? Hundreds of millions of wasted dollars to get a few planks(best case scenario) in the platform? No one cares about the platform other than at the convention. It has nothing to do with governing and never has. Is this the psychological victory Sanders gets for making half the people that used to like him, hate him? Remember he was going to win Super Tuesday? How about New York? And yeah, he said they were going to do well tonight. He has been playing a game for almost 2 months now, knowing he had no path other than Hillary dying. He's still doing it. He's still saying he has a ""narrow path"" to victory. Bernie is nothing more than a flim flam man that invaded the democratic party because it was the only way to get the money. The Millenials didn't waste as much as Karl Rove in 2008, but they are not that far from it. Huge wasted effort and money all for a con man that could never deliver anything he promised.

"d26s2f0","t3_45ygx0","45ygx0","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","There's a lot to answer here. Being a Bernie supporter doesn't mean I agree with everything he says/does either. Also, I don't dislike HRC, I just like Bernie better.

1) Income and wealth inequality - what can I say, I agree with you. But Clinton says the same thing as Bernie here, so I don't see this as being an argument in favor of Clinton.

2) It's time to make college tuition and debt free - I think this is a good argument. At least, the argument presented in the article (which is essentially boils down to federal funding going towards administrative bloat) makes sense. What actually happens though? Does government money go to improving the quality of education or increasing the size of bureaucracy? California public colleges used to be free and while they were free, they were the best in the country. When Reagan pulled funding from the California school system did it get better or worse? It got worse. What about other countries that have free education? In my opinion the argument against making college tuition and debt free works in theory... in practice it falls apart. Tuition free colleges tend to offer a better product (education being the product).

3) Getting big money out of politics - no argument here.

4) Creating jobs and rebuilding America - My understanding is that the infrastructure bank would function like any other bank (and make a profit like other banks). Money for infrastructure projects would come partly from the bank and a small part of it would come from taxes. Why would there be so many problems in creating the bank? I don't know if I can accept ""it just wouldn't work""... maybe that's fine for you. You didn't mention what kinds of problems you have with Sanders' plans to pay for his projects and many of those plans come from independent third parties (not Sanders himself). So you're really criticizing the economists and others that came up with the numbers. As far as not being able to do anything with a republican controlled house and senate: I don't know if republicans can be any more obstructionist. So we are to propose moderately progressive (realistic) plans and then compromise until they basically look like conservative plans? Whether you are a moderate or an arch-leftist, you're going to meet the same hard-headed conservative push back. You talk about whether people would accept these taxes. First of all, I don't think you really need to raise taxes that much on the middle and lower classes (just make taxation more progressive and close loopholes). Secondly, people accept very high tax rates elsewhere, why wouldn't they do so in the US? It's a matter of what you get for the taxes you pay. If the benefits in terms of infrastructure are worth it, then the tax is worth it.


$15 an hour is an arbitrary number. No argument from me there. I would try to tie the minimum wage to cost of living (although that is easier said than done). But $12 (Clinton proposed) is also an arbitrary number and so is our current minimum wage. As for harming small businesses: I don't think that's a valid argument. It would be best for small businesses if they didn't have to pay their workers anything, but it would be better for society as a whole if workers and bosses and everyone had some sort of income they could spend to drive the economy. If you can argue that a $15 minimum wage is too much and harms businesses, you can argue that a $7 or $4 minimum wage is too much and harms small businesses. The $15 number is probably based on a cost of living estimate. If you have a job and work 40-60 hours a week, you should be able to afford the basic necessities. That's just the (real) price of employing human labor. You're paying for another person to have shelter, clothing, food, etc. (i.e. to survive).

"d2flvm6","t3_45ygx0","45ygx0","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","> So he'll create a higher minimum wage which will kill small businesses and franchises but he'll also raise the taxes so it'll cancel out a lot of the increase anyway

That is also not so simple. A lot of the argument against minimum wage increases is hearsay and invocation of the magic ""invisible hand"" but actual evidence seems to be sparse and at times contradictory.

https://www.dol.gov/featured/minimum-wage/mythbuster

You can click on the ""Studies"" drop-down menu if you want more evidence. As I alluded to earlier, when you increase the purchasing power of minimum wage earners, they will spend more and put more into the economy. When you otherwise increase company revenues, it is are more likely to go to moving companies offshore or to hiding money in trust funds. From http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/inequality/the-effects-of-raising-the-minimum-wage :

> Evidence leads us to conclude that moderate increases in the minimum wage are a useful means of raising wages in the lower part of the wage distribution that has little or no effect on employment and hours. This is what one seeks in a policy tool, solid benefits with small costs. That said, current research does not speak to whether the same results would hold for large increases in the minimum wage. - See more at: http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/inequality/the-effects-of-raising-the-minimum-wage#sthash.OcrIfp88.dpuf","2016-04-24 18:44:53","1","starvminn_martin","1747872151.570405","climate crisis","manual"

Solar panels require rare earths and fossil fuels to manufacture.  Reflective solar also requires fossil fuels and is now losing out to photo-voltaic on efficiency.  We're also nowhere near getting our transit infrastructure working without fossil fuels (air, trucks, etc.)  Any raw materials or completed panels are going to be moved from place to place with fossil fuels, which means we need to fix our fossil fuel infrastructure as well in the short-term.  

The idea that we can go renewable without nuclear is worse than a pipe dream.  It's like buying a plug-in hybrid and then riding your bike to work, you've effectively made things worse by digging up raw materials and manufacturing that car.  You need nuclear if you want a clean method to run the economy that will make the renewable infrastructure (including a new grid).
