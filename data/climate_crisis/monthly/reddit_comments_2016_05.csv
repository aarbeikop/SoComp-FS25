Yes, he should know something about this issue. Obviously this is a CA issue, but it also has national importance. And as someone who has put a ton of emphasis on the CA primary, it shows a concerning lack of interest/curiosity that he hasn't educated himself on one of the primary issues facing the state in the near future.

I've seen almost nothing to indicate that Sanders has any interest in the details of policy. He talks in broad themes, which is fine, but there needs to be something under the surface. He also needs to indicate an interest in issues that aren't his core priorities. Foreign policy is a tremendous portion of the President's job description, but when talking about it, he seems disinterested at best.","2016-05-31 20:40:27","124","Wrath-of-God","1747873615.5826728","climate crisis","manual"
"d3qv1gs","t3_4lxbu3","4lxbu3","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","With as much weight as he is putting on California, would it have killed him to take an hour or two to brush up on one of the major issues facing the state (and other states)? Water rights are a huge deal in the Western states (see: The Milagro Beanfield War, et al.), and the federal government plays a huge role in them due to fact that all major rivers span multiple states. This is not just a California issue, it's a ""west-of-the-mississippi"" issue. And, with climate change playing such a large role in his platform, he should *absolutely* be well-versed in this issue, as water rights have been an environmentalist issue since the big dams went up in the 50's and 60's. 

I honestly think Bernie has decided to call it a day and coast through California with nothing but stump speeches (which isn't far from his status quo). I hope, for the sake of his dignity and legacy, that he manages to deviate from his stump for his DNC speech. I disagree with much of what the proposes, but I don't want to see a large number of first-time voters be turned off of political activism if he meets a humiliating end.

His inability to give a informed answer on the California water crisis falls on his handlers in the end. They should have known that this question would show up in California. As far as the impact I'm not sure its going to hurt him. Sandernistas only have a passing interest in state issues like this. They care more about ideological goals than practical good government issues. In saying that I think this might resonate a little more among older liberals and moderate Democrats but then again i think they are Clinton supporters anyways so it really doesn't matter.

Full disclosure, I am a Sanders supporter, but I do think that he should look more into the water crisis, at least. But still, as far as the job criteria goes - new issues will arise during a presidency and local issues will become national matters - both of which mean the president may not be fully educated in them before they fall on his or her desk. I am drawn to candidate willing to say ""i am not taking a position until i know more"". I think it prevents rash decisions being made just to save face.

Now on the Venezuela thing. Their form of socialism is *nothing like* what Sanders is promoting. And I sincerely hope voters understand this. Because lining up for bread and toothpaste is an extreme that nobody, including Sanders, wants. But healthcare, education, research, all these are important and need more funding.

"d3kpji5","t3_4l60lj","4l60lj","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","I don't think we'll see any concrete policy leads from this one. Each of the members is fractured on big, specific issues.

On the Chinese buildup in the South China Sea, most everyone is in agreement that they don't want what's happening to continue, but the only member with any serious ability to posture against it, the US, isn't willing to to make the issue a military one publicly. Obama is only to go as as far as calling it a threat to unrestricted comercial shipping and aviation so far. It should be noted that Vietnam was invited as a special guest, which would seem to hint at a larger strategic  stratagizing agenda on this particular issue, but it's more likely Vietnam was invited for trade talks input as a grand stage kudos to them without making the members take any hard-line stances on strategic concerns. 

Another big agenda item is global economic stimulus, but austerity loving Germans, and the cash strapped UK are against any concrete agreements on doing anything about it. 

Global trade was another major point, and I'm only offering my conjecture here, but the other nations of wary of being seen as entirely complicit with the very US friendly trade agreements currently in the works. Even if they know their residents will actually benefit from further deals, and coupled with the US's attempts to coerce digital storage rights in other countries, this galls Europeans. Besides the sovereignty issues, it threatens free trade in the digital domain that is a vital role for advanced countries who need to move workers from manufacturing to high tech service.
