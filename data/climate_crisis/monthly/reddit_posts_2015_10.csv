It's a record-breaking meteorological marvel but could quickly turn into a major humanitarian crisis when it makes landfall.

We're two journalists and a meteorologist who work at [WXshift](http://wxshift.com), a Climate Central powered weather website that provides climate context for your daily forecast. We're here to answer your questions about the records Patricia is setting, potential impacts and anything else you want to know about this storm or why this year has seen a [record number of strong tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere](http://wxshift.com/news/the-northern-hemisphere-just-set-a-cyclone-record).

"3n3zav","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Wha (in your opinion)t are thw most frustrating commonly held beliefs of each party's base?","Dempcrats: free/government paid for stuff means everyone will get it.

The reality is that free does not mean infinite it just means arbitrary rules will now govern availability of something (like say college education or healthcare) instead of the ability to pay for it. Everything is rationed by something, all this does is change what is doing the rationing. The difference is that government rules are a lot less flexible and harder to change than markets where money gets you what you need, and can create what you need if it is not already in existence. Not saying subsidies shouldn't exist, those can help but replacing the market with government fundamentally changes more than just who pays for stuff.

Republicans:
This country was designed as a Christian nation/ Christianity is ok to use as part of law but not other religions.

For the love of all things holy. NO. America is a Christian nation by population,  but our government was set up specifically to render this point moot. Also saying that one set of morals is ok to legislate because Christianity flies in the face of the constitution so please just stop.","2015-10-01 15:09:56","0","39","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n3zav/wha_in_your_opiniont_are_thw_most_frustrating/","True","slam7211","1747862969.826367","climate crisis","manual"

I've appended it with some thoughts I have regarding applying its lessons to conversation about food:

---

> I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element.

>It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather.

> I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal.

> In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized.

> If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming.

**I am the one that makes the decisions when choosing food, and conversing about it.**

**How I choose to converse about food influences the emotional response of others, and thus their receptivity to new ideas.**

**Because I have a choice and influence, I am in control of making conversation about food miserable or joyous for those participating.**

**I cannot choose what others will say, but I can choose my responses carefully so as to navigate the conversation without hurting feelings and being dissuaded from further conversation.**

**If we shame, blame, or otherwise negate the feelings of others in conversation about food choices, we reinforce the idea that we are inhospitable, and drive away those that may otherwise come back around some day.**

**Conversely, if we encourage others and congratulate them for the positive steps they do take, we reinforce the idea that our community is hospitable, knowledgable, and worth taking a longer look at.**
