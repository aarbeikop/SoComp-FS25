However I believe/hope that it will be less than 10% before 2100.  The relatively rosy  outlook is loosely based on our developing understanding of ECS, sea level rise and CO2 ""half life"" based on on going observational studies.

I believe/hope that by then global population will have stabilized and possibly started to shrink reducing the stress on the biosphere thereby reducing the risk.","2018-03-17 23:02:39","2","JazzboTN","1747904379.5863419","climate crisis","manual"

"dvuir00","t3_852ve9","852ve9","climatechange","action-oriented","It's not just the burning of fossil fuels though. Even if we (somehow) reduced emissions to zero in 15 years, there is also the aerosol effect to consider (0.8-1.2°C of warming), and the effects of continued deforestation. 

Deforestation is unavoidable if we continue to have a growing population and/or increasing quality of life for the developing world - its been predicted that milk demand in China alone will result in a 30%increase in GHG emissions from cows between now and 2050 - and a large increase in deforestation as well. The Amazon alone has 150-200 Pg of stored carbon - equal to around 18 years of current emissions - and is responsible for sequestering ~0.4 Pg of carbon per year. The WWF estimates that we have deforested around 18% of the amazon in the past 50 years, and recent estimates (2018) suggest a ""tipping point"" of 20-25% deforestation. That is only the Amazon, let alone rainforest in Asia and Africa, or forests in North America that are burning down and already starting to *not grow back*.

We also should consider the reduced carbon sink ability of the ocean as it warms, as well as increased ocean acidity on the ability for essential biodiversity to flourish.

Then think about the permafrost and any potential forcing from a permafrost that is *already melting* at an increased rate.

Now consider that there is a 15-30 year lag time between the emissions of GHGs and the full effects being felt. That means we are only just feeling the effects of the early 2000's, and our emissions ramped up from there until 2014, when we stayed even for a few years and now increasing again. We haven't started to see the full effects of this yet. Now, consider the combined effects of 15 more years of (decreasing, under your scenario) emissions, combined with atmospheric aerosol loss, increased deforestation, loss of the oceanic carbon sink (and forest carbon sinks), increased emissions from permafrost and forest biomes, etc.

We are currently at ~1°C of warming. With a lowball aerosol effect we're at 1.8, and with 15 years of emissions more, that is an easy 2. Consider everything else, I would estimate an *extremely* optimistic scenario of 2.25°C by 2055 or so. This is if we don't trigger any ""tipping points"" such as the amazon or permafrost, etc.

Is this enough to cause catastrophe? Some would say yes, some would say no. It depends on a lot of factors including how much attention we give to adaptation technologies and structural reforms. Also not considering potential tipping points in oceanic phytoplankton levels, etc that could collapse the food chain and/or oxygen production methods (as I don't know what level of warming would probabilisticaly cause those).

In any case, even best case 15 year zero emissions, no feedbacks or tipping points - we're looking at a very rough future. ","2018-03-17 14:29:07","1","InvisibleRegrets","1747904379.594303","climate crisis","manual"
"dvunnv8","t3_852ve9","852ve9","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm not sure that trying to put ""global catastrophe levels"" into a taxonomy really illustrates anything interesting. It seems more likely to be just another way of expressing a specific combination of anxiety and uncertainty.

For instance, it's possible that the sustainable population-carrying capacity of the Earth is lower than the current population. Is a long-term population decline which ultimately reaches that sustainable level a ""global catastrophe""? It might or might not, depending on where you draw the lines. But the lines don't have any independent significance. 

Our ability to model climate states *and human responses* several decades in the future is very limited. Further, a gamma-ray burst could tear off half our atmosphere tomorrow — we can't really model that probability either, except to say that with current crude models the likelihood seems pretty low. We don't even know how likely it is that we'll have a civilization long enough to be affected by climate change. 

Specific impacts are easier to talk about, at least, and I think the ocean is the right place to start. Coastal land loss can be mitigated by the not-exactly-new technology of building seawalls: So that's a political problem, not a technological one.

Ecosystem collapse in the ocean (and not just due to acidification) is more worrying, since we probably don't have the tools to manage that ecosystem effectively. But humans have already adapted to some smallish ecosystem collapses in that environment. It may be that the development of further adaptations (e.g.: aquaculture) is just a matter of scaling up. 

Terrestrial agriculture is a hugely adaptable industry, though. I can't put this into quantitative terms, but it seems to me that given just 75% of the ag resources currently known in the New World, a huge variety of ag outputs are possible. I don't think New World agriculture has been maximized for quantity output in some time, but if market demand develops then I'll bet huge maximization leaps are possible. For this reason I consider terrestrial agriculture a medium concern, rather than an urgent one. Although the Eastern Hemisphere might be more precarious, if desertification is a huge impact there.
