I feel like we are definitely not doing enough and we are at a turning point, where things aren't going well.

I mean talking about EVERYTHING. Look at who is in power: Donald Trump, Maduro, Bolsonaro, Boris and being mexican I cant fucking stand Lopez Obrador etc.. Corruption, power, migration, death... Also there's greedy corporations that dont give a fuck about the planet and how they deeply influence society. 

AND ON TOP OF THAT, THE PLACE THAT WE CALL HOME IS DYING. Imagine all the illnesses, fires, earthquackes, crisis that are going to happen in a not so far future!! IT'S TOO MUCH TO HANDLE

I mean I know there's some awesome stuff that technology has brought, but what's the point of all of that if it's not doing any better? 

I even think im wasting my time by having a 9 to 5 job instead finding a way if living life. I have a student loan i have to pay and I feel anchored what the fuck, what's the point if life as we know it will completely change?

The reason im posting this is because I think I'm getting depressed by everything that's going on right now and I dont know how to handle that.

Yang's plan also stresses that the climate crisis is ""worse than we think,"" and therefore we must begin relocating coastal communities to higher ground.

"cn4lpw","vegan","unknown","We plan nothing short of GLOBAL VEGAN REVOLUTION!","*--repost from earlier with bits of additional info--* 

 

We, **ANIMAL REBELLION**, r/AnimalRebellion are a new decentralised volunteer organisation and we are planning to bring together over 10k of volunteers and activists in a major action in London, UK (in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion) to challenge the current food production systems and demand **a transition from animal agriculture and fishing to plant based** both in the UK and globally!

This is a one of a kind opportunity for us vegans to work together with environmentalists (overcoming any differences) to strongly challenge the current food production system based on animal abuse and destruction of nature. **We are focusing on the system change** (end meat/fish subsidies, slash agricultural impact on climate change, stop oceans depletion), but we expect this to start massive personal change as well, due to media focus attracting exponential growth of vegan population (as a result of education, myths busting etc.).

**WHAT?** We will go out on the streets and exercise our human right to a peaceful protest and civil disobedience (think Suffragettes, civil rights, Gandhi). We will demand the system change and we will educate people about veganism in the process.

**HOW?** By joining forces with about 20 animal rights organisations and also influencers and celebrities and in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion - a successful environmental movement that attracted a lot of attention to the issue of climate crisis and obliteration of biodiversity. It is acknowledged that fighting climate change and reverting biodiversity loss is impossible without changing agricultural system on the land and fishing practices on the sea.

**WHERE?** Initially in London, UK, but other countries (e.g. Canada, Israel) have already expressed interest in aligning their actions and we expect many more to join before October! 

**WHY?** Because animals and planet!!!

**WHEN?** 07 October will be the start of our two weeks of protest. But for now we work hard to make the International Animal Rights March (17 August in UK) the biggest to date - this is when we will formally declare the creation of the movement.

**If you would like be a part of it, but outside of UK**, then you can:

**1. Create your local Animal Rebellion group,** using the same self-organising processes we've learnt from XR and following our 10 Principles: [http://www.animalrebellion.org/values/](http://www.animalrebellion.org/values/)

**2. Contact our group coordinator, Tim Speers on** [**info@animalrebellion.org**](mailto:info@animalrebellion.org) **for support, training and documentation.** Tim will work with you and add you to the private discussion group for all Animal Rebellion local/national group coordinators. *Please put ""NEW GROUP"" into the subject of your email to Tim.*

**3. Find your local XR group through social media and express solidarity and interest in working together.** At the UK national level, Animal Rebellion and Extinction Rebellion are in talks to develop plans on how we best work together around actions, media and achieving our common goals. We hope to see this replicated across the globe.

**4. Plan a local action for October 7th and/or for the two following weeks.**

**5. Spread the word!** Follow us across all the social media channels.

**6. Contact your local and national media and help reach out to others.** Please contact our media team on [media@animalrebellion.org](mailto:media@animalrebellion.org) if you need any support with this.

"cl68ic","futurology","unknown","A More Simple 'Fix' to Climate Change Exists? | For Discussion","Hello Everyone,

Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that to keep the rise in [**global temperatures below 1.5C this century**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45678338), emissions of carbon dioxide would have to be cut by 45% by 2030. 

One of the understated headlines in last year's [**IPCC report**](https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf) was that global emissions of carbon dioxide must peak by 2020 to keep the planet below 1.5C.

Current plans are nowhere near strong enough to keep temperatures below the so-called safe limit. Right now, we are heading towards 3C of heating by 2100 not 1.5.

As countries usually scope out their plans over five and 10 year time-frames, if the 45% carbon cut target by 2030 is to be met then the plans really need to be on the table by the end of 2020.

BUT

I have recently come across several articles which SEEM to say that another way to 'FIX' our climate(or at the very least, BUY US SOME TIME) we would have to plant 1 TRILLION trees around the world, which would reduce emissions in the air.

 [https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/issues/planting-trillion-trees.htm](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/conservation/issues/planting-trillion-trees.htm) 

 [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/ethiopia-plants-250m-trees-in-a-day-to-help-tackle-climate-crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/ethiopia-plants-250m-trees-in-a-day-to-help-tackle-climate-crisis) 

So, which is true? Are both true at the same time?  If both are true, why is this not discussed more in the main stream media? And why haven't we begun to SERIOUSLY plant millions of trees yet outside of Ethiopia it seems?!  It seems like such an easy(and far cheaper) solution than having to implement 'Green New Deals' across the world in a short time frame.

We should be planting trees AND moving to green economies, not just 1 of these options","2019-08-02 16:17:55","4","15","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/cl68ic/a_more_simple_fix_to_climate_change_exists_for/","True","Mansa_Sekekama","1747929936.686846","climate crisis","manual"
