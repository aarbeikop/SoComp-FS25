"dgdh6eu","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","What are your opinions on nuclear power.

In my eyes renewable energy sources are not efficient enough to carry the energy demands of a big country. Especially those that do not benefit from solar or hydroelectric power have to rely on fossil fuels for electricity.

Nuclear power has its known risks but it can cut emissions for a low price. I think opting to combat climate change and opting against nuclear power are a combination that dont go well. I had Germany in mind when typing this. All the negatives of nuclear due to its neighbours, increased electricity prices, and increased reliance on coal. Climate change was used specifically to drive a political agenda.

What are your opinions on this.

"dgdi946","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","* Thanks for doing an AMA. As much as I understand that climate change by human activity is very real, I have always wondered if it made any sense to unilaterally act to reduce our carbon foot print. Even if the relatively richer west magically cuts out carbon emissions totally, which is impossible, the rest of the world (and thats a vast majority of human activity!) isn't going to do so. This is as much a political issue as it is a scientific one. If governments elsewhere can't even get a gripe on wars, crimes, corruption., etc.. there is no way they will start listening to the rich west telling them to slow down on development and be clean, even if they did believe in the legitimacy of the science, which itself has become debate in the west.


* I have always argued that rather than fund climate change policies, it would do a whole lot more good to simply fund education (reduce human stupid) and new technologies that out strip carbon reliance (this we have some, but not quite there yet). So that the developing nations actually want to adopt new methods of energy production. It is still economics in the end.


* I compare this situation to cancer research; I once attended a seminar where a speaker controversially declared that had all the billions in cancer research been instead channeled into eradicating cigarettes (taking down the big and powerful lobby of tobacco companies) and bad modern diets (as well as crap food lobbies), it would have prevented a whole lot more cancers than any of the new treatments and drugs combined.

The Women's March got a lot of attention, although the message was muddled. Once they start having a protest a week, is anyone going to care anymore? I think most people will just say, ""Oh, another protest. They're always protesting about something.""

That said, there's not much that can be done about this since there's no central authority that controls protests. It's a tragedy of the commons problem. Every group with an issue is going to protest since that's the cool thing to do and they're all going to drown each other out.

A lot of these protests aren't even Trump-specific. I thought the airport protests were the most effective thus far, because they targeted a Trump-specific issue that had highly visible consequences--people at airports being denied entry into the U.S. But if people are be protesting something that any standard-issue Republican would have done, I don't think the general public is really going to care.

Hillary was an awful candidate who would've sounded good on a few progressive positions, but ultimately would've screwed over the base in a way that would've been spun to her favor by her media mavens.

The vast majority of people in this country live in the middle of it and Clinton's contempt for them was palpable during her campaign.  Democrats will continue to own that contempt until they jettison her.  Bernie Sanders has compromised himself with his endorsement of Clinton, so he's of no use.  Dems need to rally behind a cause that truly impacts all people and is at the forefront of much of the problems of the world today.  It's not climate change, it's war.

Unfortunately, to rally against war would mean Dems would have to admit what a warmonger Obama was and his role in expanding the war powers of Bush and other presidents.  It means a return to classic liberal values, including support for civil liberties.  Without civil liberties, no amount of science or climate-friend changes will matter.

Dems also need to recognize that the DNC continues to put them in the same position RNC voters end up: i.e. Who else are you gonna vote for?  At least if there was a surge of Green support (serious surge) as there has been for Libertarians, you'd have a chance of at least influencing the DNC.
