1. I think for most Americans Katrina is our metric for horrible hurricanes. How much worse will Patricia be?

2. Katrina is often called a man made disaster due to the various conditions on the ground that made the humanitarian situation so much worse (everything from wetland loss to an inadequate evacuation plan). Are there similar issues on the ground in the likely impacted regions? What is being done to address them? 

Lastly, if anyone wants to donate to an organization to help do you have any recommendations?","2015-10-23 18:31:03","814","firedrops","1747862366.2477481","climate crisis","manual"
