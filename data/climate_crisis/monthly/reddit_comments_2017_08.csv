"dmbkl2m","t3_6wxqyo","6wxqyo","futurology","unknown",">What will be our salvation for this food shortage?

Make more food. Problem solved. We can. We're not doing that right now because _why would we?_

The premise of the article is silly. It's saying that if population continues to grow, and if we don't adjust to that by producing more food...at some point population growth might result in consuming more food than our current levels of production would allow.

Well, _yeah_. And? What's the point here? Here's a thought for you: look at how much food is in your refrigerator right now. If you continue to consume food at your present rate without buying any more, eventually you'll run out. Oh no! Clearly your current rate of food consumption, if continued, will lead to your eventual starvation! Whatever shall you do!?!?! Oh wait, you'd buy more food, right? Oh, but wait! Even if you bought a second refrigerator and filled it with food..._even still_ you could look at the amount of food and compare it to your rate of consumption and see that clearly you would eventually run out! Oh no, oh no!

This isn't that complicated. Food is basically dirt and sunlight. Neither of which we're in danger of running out of at any point in the next several billion years. We're not producing more food right now because _what would we do with it_?

If it was up to me, food waste would be illegal. All restaurants and supermarkets would be prohibited by law from throwing away unused food, but would have to give it to a government agency designed to redistribute it to places where it's needed, and organic waste would also be exported for use in agriculture.","2017-08-30 12:41:56","7","Kahing","1747895987.811782","climate crisis","manual"
"dmbrg9f","t3_6wxqyo","6wxqyo","futurology","unknown","From 1980 through today the number of calories available per day per person on the planet has increased from 2000 to 2700.  Why would I expect things to get so bad over the next decade.  The article talks about India currently not importing any food and how that could become a net food importer in the next decade.  That ignores that India was a net food importer for the majority of the 20th century and is currently the sixth largest food exporter in the world.  Growth in agricultural production has exceeding population growth in India for decades and today that population growth is starting to wane significantly.  India is expected to reach replacement fertility within the next five years.  

It talks about China which is currently well below population replacement fertility.  China is a net food importer, but they are also a major agricultural producer.  The country has huge stockpiles of food.  

Really for the last 50 years growth in agricultural production in most of the world has exceeded population growth.  Even if that trend stopped over the next decade we would still be producing far more calories per person on the planet by 2027 than we were in 1980.  

This looks like a bunch of empty assertions by a commodity trader who is promoting her new business without any real research to back it up.

The latter. There will be some fluctuation in demand and prices which will change what poorer people eat. That will in turn change what is viable to produce and what isn't and also where it will be viable factoring in climate change. For a lot of nothern countries this will be mean that more can be produced with the same amount of land. For a lot of southern countries, especially Africa and the Middle East, it will mean a huge deficit in produce and some serious famines awaits.","2017-08-30 09:13:31","2","ReallyMuhammad","1747895987.8170629","climate crisis","manual"

Fire three nukes, one to the source of Yellow River and the Yangtze (which are fairly close so one bomb would be enough for both of them)
