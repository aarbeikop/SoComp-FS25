First, let me preamble my response by stating that, while I am a relatively newly converted Bernie enthusiast, I also dislike when many of his supporters shrug off tough questions.

However, I also think there is a bit of dismissive ""establishment"" hand waving when it comes to Hillary and what she'll do to make her plans work. Yes, I know her ideas are nowhere near as ambitious as Bernie's, but she is literally the most hated woman in America by anyone with a conservative bent. She claims to have weathered attacks for years from the right, but also neglects to consider that, if elected, she will *continue* to have to withstand the pressure of attacks from the GOP for the next 4 or 8 years.
_____________________
Now, moving on to the core of the discussion.

When, I say I disagree, I mean I disagree with the premise.

Bernie Sanders is a populist, revolutionary dissident whose ideas are radical in terms of the modern political norm. He *does* have big plans, but most importantly, I think, is what he represents on the whole.

Obama, for example, represented change, but negotiated from the middle on so many issues that little of it ever came. He also turned out to be more establishment in his first 6 years than anyone had hoped or predicted.

* Bernie is running in a momentous time for American politics. Should he win, he very well *may* get the Senate back due to his popularity. If people vote down-ticket, and he gets elected in a populist groundswell, it's almost a guarantee that he gets the senate. 

The House? No. But that won't matter much at first. He won't be able to pass much without them, but the onslaught of populist proposals will be hard for them to weather.

* Depending on how the next 6 months go, Bernie may also have is own SCOTUS justice to nominate right off the bat. Shortly after, he'll likely have RBG's (82 years) seat to fill, as well - and possibly even Anthony Kennedy (79) and  Stephen Breyer (77). Scalia and Kennedy are conservative, so flipping their seats to more liberal/progressive justices will make the court 6-3, securing avenues for future progressive legislation to pass.

* Then we have the 2020 census. If Bernie can maintain his popularity through a first term and get reelected, via what (maybe little) he gets through congress, as well as his executive actions - plus any positive/popular decision the Supreme Court makes during his first term, he may very well see a huge election in 2020 that enables the Dems to take back the house, as well - or at least make it even enough to create coalition voting blocs.

* If they can get a majority in the 2018 or 2020 election, they'll be  in charge of redistricting in 2020. Most importantly, hopefully during the 4 years prior to that, *Citizens United* gets knocked down by the new court somehow, voting rights act gets restored, and avenues to clamp down on gerrymandering get enacted.

All of a sudden you have a very positive Bernie Sanders presidency, even if he only manages to sign 5-10 important bills into law the entire time he's president. 

I think what a lot of people forget is that, more than anything, the presidency is symbolic. Knowing Bernie, he'll make lots of speeches and publicly rally for causes he believes in, despite not being able to make a tangible impact on them himself. If the SCOTUS shifts, as well as the senate, and you have a TRUE liberal populist president in the white house, the whole country starts to physically reflect what polls have shown for years: the US is more progressive now that it ever has been. And a lot of the conservative walls that have stopped progress will begin to fall by the wayside - with or without Bernie's pen.","2016-02-16 01:52:38","15","jjones217","1747869212.486628","climate crisis","manual"

I don't think that Bernie is a tea party equivalent in that he would be unwilling to compromise, but his starting point is much further to the left. 

For example, I could see Clinton pushing for $12 minimum wage, and settling for $10.10. I could see Sanders pushing for $15, and settling on  $12.

No candidate is going to get everything that they want, does that mean we shouldn't vote for the person who embodies the things we'd like to see anyway?

While its absolutely true that federal aid has increased tuition, it's not true that a grant-only program that universally pays 100% of tuition would have the same kinds of systemic problems as the federal loan program. Sure, colleges might abuse the system by increasing costs year over year, but those costs would be on taxpayers instead of the students that attend the college. That's a *very* different dynamic, and IMO much more beneficial to education as a whole. It turns public universities into something more like the K-12 public school system; public services beholden to government policy.

"d019xz6","t3_45ygx0","45ygx0","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","As a Bernie supporter, I will address a few points:

Wage Gap: The wage gap does exist, but from my understanding less than assumed, around 94-96%. This comes in when you examine different factors. However, there are still things that need to be done. One of the main issues is the still present (though reducing) stigma against women in certain higher paying fields (like tech). I don't think it is necessarily unreasonable to try and make sure men/women get paid the same for a job with approximately equal qualifications. One major issue seems to be potential maternity leave (which I think is something that should definitely be covered). 

Minimum wage: I agree the minimum wage assumed is too high. I am more of a fan of a basic income living wage myself. I do think it needs to be increased, and I think this large value may be used to reach a compromise. 

However, I think one of the bigger issues is the large cost of tuition. While free tuition is far off and maybe impossible for the US, a reduced tuition could very well become possible. When we consider other countries that charge for tuition (Canada, the UK for example), they generally charge less than state schools by a fair amount (less than 8000 a year). However, they also focus less on everyone remaining in residence, having fancy accommodations etc, which take up a large portion of the cost, along with the obvious changes in taxes. Minimum wage often affects students, and being able to reduce the costs would allow for changing the minimum wage less and still helping many.

My theory as to why she hasn't endorsed is a bit simpler: she's not dumb and recognizes that given the very likely outcome of the race, throwing her lot in with Sanders would make her endorsement carry less authority. She knows that it won't mean much in the first place -- anyone who regards her as a decisive voice in the party, someone to listen to, likely already has sympathies with Sanders's cause, and Hillary doesn't need the help now anyway.
