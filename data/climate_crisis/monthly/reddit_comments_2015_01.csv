Whether this pattern is real or just appears that way is a different story. It's an interesting hypothesis - what you're really describing is cyclical culture akin to boom/bust business cycles. I don't think sociology is anywhere near evolved enough to give the idea the examination it deserves. Economics is a bit closer, but still not evolved enough.

On top of that they are doing a lot of shoe horning.  their description of 17th century England is laughable.  The crisis and prophets came about during the English civil war, the era they cite was the decline of crisis.","2015-01-22 13:11:43","2","cassander","1747849578.468943","climate crisis","manual"

Let's see if we could just as easily fit the data to a different cycle.

>The 1st Turning is a ""Crisis"". This is when the problems of the 3rd Turning come to a head, and people start to band together to overcome them. They tear down old, decaying institutions and start rebuilding them. They band together to fix their problems. This leads to the ""High"" of the next 1st Turning. The most recent 1st turning was WW2 and immediately afterwards, when people rebuilt institutions ravaged by war.

>The 2nd Turning is an ""Unraveling"". Due to the efforts of young adults during the Crisis period, institutions are now weak and individualism is high. ""Every man for himself"" is the motto. Individual identity is strong, but cultural identity and a sense of community are weak. The most recent 2nd Turning was the hippie revolution of the 1960s and 70s, which focused exclusively on individual identity and eschewed any wider sense of American community.

>The 3rd Turning is an ""Awakening"". Children who grew up during the Unraveling are now becoming young adults, and they feel disenchanted with what they see as a superficial and oppressive system. They rebel against the government, against institutions, and against their parents, and fight for individual expression and freedom from control. The most recent Awakening was the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s, when grassroots conservatives began trying to seriously turn the tide against the welfare state.

>The 4st Turning is a ""High"". In this period, institutions are strong and individualism is weak. People work together, and the sense of community is strong, but spiritual depth and diversity are somewhat muted. The most recent 4th Turning we experienced was the 90s, when people focused on culture wars rather than serious spiritual or intellectual inquiry; they re-fought the conflicts of decades ago. It was, however, a period of great economic growth as people worked together to grow the pie and strengthen institutions.

It looks like if I reverse the ""stages"", the data can be stretched to fit that just as easily.","2015-01-22 11:08:35","0","Eroticawriter4","1747849578.474009","climate crisis","manual"
