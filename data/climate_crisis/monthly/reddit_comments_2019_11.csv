 Since the 1970s, the average temperatures in spring and summer have gone up by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in California.

Higher temperatures have been linked to more [frequent and severe wildfires](http://assets.climatecentral.org/pdfs/westernwildfires2016v2.pdf).

Twelve of the 15 largest fires in California history have occurred since 2000.

 The [average wildfire season](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/breathing-fire-wildfire-smoke-smaller-newborns-more-er-visits-21917) now lasts at least [2.5 months longer](https://www.businessinsider.com/ventura-county-la-fires-california-worsening-trend-2017-12) than it did in the early 1970s.

Annual financial losses due to wildfires now range from US$63.5 billion to US$285 billion.

In 2016, up to US$285 billion in [economic losses](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1215.pdf) were caused by fire-related deaths, evacuations, and declining property values.

By 2050, California will have 24 more days each year with high risk for wildfires.

"f6paa64","t3_drxfgu","drxfgu","climatechange","action-oriented","Similar to the [federal flood insurance](https://qz.com/1064109/is-the-national-flood-insurance-program-running-out-of-money/) (which is financially unstable and to use a bad pun—under water), it’s pretty hard to cover damages from increasing environmental disasters. We can blame the California home insurers, but realistically they’re not wrong that it’s a dead-end for sustainable insurance there. 

This insurance problem puts the burden of climate change on individuals and not those who contribute the most to it (corporations and governments). 

Try selling a house that had flooded, burned in wildfire, or can’t get insured. You can’t move out but you can’t survive. 

I don’t know if there is really a solution here. 🥺 How do you insure against climate change?","2019-11-06 14:47:10","1","CatLadyAM","1747933247.162536","climate crisis","manual"

New America Foundation: This organization uses policy papers, media articles, books, and educational events to influence public opinion on such topics as healthcare, environmentalism, energy policy, the Mideast conflict, global governance, and much more.

&#x200B;

New Israel Fund: This organization gives support to NGOs that regularly produce reports accusing Israel of human-rights violations and religious persecution.

&#x200B;

NewsCorpWatch: A project of Media Matters For America, NewsCorpWatch was established with the help of a $1 million George Soros grant to Media Matters.

&#x200B;

Pacifica Foundation: This entity owns and operates Pacifica Radio, awash from its birth with the socialist-Marxist rhetoric of class warfare and hatred for capitalism.

&#x200B;

Palestinian Center for Human Rights: This NGO investigates and documents what it views as Israeli human-rights violations against Palestinians.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Peace Development Fund: In PDF’s calculus, the United States needs a massive overhaul of its social and economic institutions. “Recently,” explains PDF, “we have witnessed the negative effects of neo-liberalism and the globalization of capitalism, the de-industrialization of the U.S. and the growing gap between the rich and poor …”

&#x200B;

People for the American Way: This group opposes the Patriot Act, anti-terrorism measures generally, and the allegedly growing influence of the “religious right.”

&#x200B;

People Improving Communities Through Organizing: This group uses Alinsky-style organizing tactics to advance the doctrines of the religious left.

Prepare New York: This group supported the proposed construction of a Muslim Community Center near Ground Zero in lower Manhattan – a project known as the Cordoba Initiative, headed by Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Prison Moratorium Project: This initiative was created in 1995 for the express purpose of working for the elimination of all prisons in the United States and the release of all inmates. Reasoning from the premise that incarceration is never an appropriate means of dealing with crime, it deems American society’s inherent inequities the root of all criminal behavior.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Pro Publica: Claiming that “investigative journalism is at risk,” this group aims to remedy this lacuna in news publishing by “expos\[ing\] abuses of power and betrayals of the public trust by government, business, and other institutions, using the moral force of investigative journalism to spur reform through the sustained spotlighting of wrongdoing.”

&#x200B;

Proteus Fund: This foundation directs its philanthropy toward a number of radical leftwing organizations.

&#x200B;

Psychologists for Social Responsibility: This anti-capitalist, anti-corporate, anti-military, anti-American organization “uses psychological knowledge and skills to promote peace with social justice at the community, national and international levels.”

&#x200B;

Public Citizen Foundation: Public Citizen seeks increased government intervention and litigation against corporations — a practice founded on the notion that American corporations, like the capitalist system of which they are a part, are inherently inclined toward corruption.

&#x200B;

Public Justice Center: Viewing America as a nation rife with injustice and discrimination, this organization engages in legislative and policy advocacy to promote “systemic change for the disenfranchised.”","2019-11-18 09:27:45","4","LLtheMadKing","1747934011.581362","climate crisis","manual"
