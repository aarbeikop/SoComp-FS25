I have said that anthropogenic activity has caused to some extent the climate change crisis we are in right now. I know we are both right, just need some kind of sorting out between our claims. Any diplomatic help would be appreciated. Thank you.","2019-12-29 15:22:33","2","74","0.58","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/eh72c7/unflawed_models_of_climate_change/","True","australiano","1747934675.710368","climate crisis","manual"
"e6gb9u","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I just said goodbye to my nonexistent children.","Ever since I can remember, I was sure that having kids was in my future. I was sure that I would enjoy being a parent and would create lots of incredible memories with my children. Well that won't happen now. In the last few years, as I got older, I heard more and more in the news about the climate crisis and for the first time understood a bit more clearly what lies in our future. Combined with my studies to become a primary school teacher (age 6-10 where I come from) and my job at such a primary school I slowly started to understand how incredibly irresponsible and egoistical it is to have kids even now, more so in 5-10 years. Last night, after reading another shocking piece of news, that train of thought hit me again and I decided there and then that I won't have children, because if I really care so much for them, how could I put such a burden on their shoulders? So it may seem dumb, but I just said goodbye to my kids and a lifelong dream forever and it hurts like a bitch.","2019-12-05 12:07:50","0","11","0.27","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/e6gb9u/i_just_said_goodbye_to_my_nonexistent_children/","True","Henoboy99","1747935276.776327","climate crisis","manual"
"e80b7p","environmental_science","unknown","Did you know that the environment can have a direct impact on your mental health?","(Throwaway account because I am posting this in affiliation with my abnormal psychology class, and I don't want my personal and academic lives to mesh) 

 [https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaax0903/tab-pdf](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaax0903/tab-pdf)  (pdf available for download via the link)

According to research published earlier this year by  Gregory N. Bratman, et al; the environment can have a direct interaction with our mental health. It's effects can range from simply improving your mood to having a grounding effect that boosts your focus and attention. While the exact magnitude of what level of interaction equals to what level effect in a person is still undetermined, the study concluded that nature and an interaction with it as small as being near a tree in a city (cataloged as an ""urban green"" experience in the study) can fulfill a beneficial impact on the human psyche. A take away from the study is that ""\[Diverse shareholders\] including city planners, landscape architects, engineers, parks departments, developers, infrastructure providers, health professionals, community-based organizations, and environmental advocates, could use a tool that helps them anticipate the mental health impacts of decisions they make relating to the environment."" Meaning that cities can and should be designed with a connection to nature in mind to maintain our basic requirement for natural stimulation. However, this raises a question about our current climate crisis not often addressed by politics, which is, how will our collapsing ecosystem come to effect human mentality? When we no longer have access to forests, fields, or clean bodies of water, will the impact go beyond the death of our planet, to effect all of us at a deep psychological level?

Might it be advisable to update our system so you don't need to receive traditional mail in order to participate in society. If you can sustain a decent standard of life, and be mobile isn't that a huge advantage over traditional homes?","2019-12-14 21:07:06","4","38","0.64","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/eapczc/will_we_need_stationery_houses_in_the_future/","True","Memetic1","1747935718.701372","climate crisis","manual"
