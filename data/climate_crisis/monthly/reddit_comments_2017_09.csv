My favorite part when he said ""I will always put America first"" which I thought was a little brash and out of place in the context of the speech, but then he turned it around by saying ""Just like you should always put your country first.""","2017-09-19 15:36:43","155","TheWindWaker01","1747897192.981257","climate crisis","manual"

"dn7t1lm","t3_713f0q","713f0q","Conservative","unknown","I thought it was fantastic.  It was awesome to watch a President stand in front of the UN and stress the importance of the independent nation-state and call out socialism.   He reminded the UN that the US is paying in far more than anyone else - and that he would be okay with that if the UN was actually effective in accomplishing it's mission of peace.

Naturally, the much of the left will flip their shit, as expected.  CNN, MSNBC and the like will cherry pick quotes out of context to spin negatively.  Or they'll say it was ""dark.""","2017-09-19 15:05:36","68","BELIEVE_ME_FOLKS","1747897192.986031","climate crisis","manual"

National Sovereignty is to be respected and that nations will pursue their interest as well as common interest at the UN. It is a multilateral group of nations. Not a governing body. 

North Korea is not respecting the national sovereignty of its neighbors by their continuing threats and must be dealt with. ","2017-09-19 15:18:37","42","CarolinaPunk","1747897192.98971","climate crisis","manual"

They'll all hate it even though the things he said we're factual. 

They hate the truth because it pushes their failures out into the light. Nearly everything he brought up that was wrong could be traced back to globalist policies and leftist ideals.","2017-09-19 15:00:03","41","[deleted]","1747897192.9936352","climate crisis","manual"
