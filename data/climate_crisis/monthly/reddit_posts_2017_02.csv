"5tuz5g","vegan","unknown","How long before things get so bad people are forced to go vegan?","With pollution from factory-farming, stripping of the rain forests to make room for more livestock, and fishing the oceans dry, how long until real meat is too expensive or too polluted for normal people to afford? We have begun to see a small decrease in lifespan already, perhaps that will continue to grow worse as time moves on?

There are all kinds of dire predictions being made like in the next 10-50 years, things like 1 in 3 will have diabetes, 40% of the population will be morbidly obese. How long until the health insurance system completely collapses under the high cost of caring for all of these chronically sick people?

How long until doctors and the establishment **finally** start recommending people go vegetarian or vegan? *(I assume this will happen when the system completely collapses because we can no longer afford care for anyone and being vegan will be the only thing you can do.)*

I know more and more people are becoming vegetarian or vegan, but it's a such a painfully slow rate, compared to how fast obesity and disease are growing.

Most people I talk to still look at me like I've grown a second head when I tell them 50% of the people who die in this country die of heart disease and 70%+ of people in the USA are overweight.
Very few people (healthier meat-eaters included) seem to have ANY idea that a health crisis is taking place.

How bad does it have to get before people ask: ""Is this normal for so many people to be sick? What went wrong?""
