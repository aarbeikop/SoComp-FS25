"4lxbu3","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Asked by a reporter about the water crisis in California, Bernie says he has not studied the issue. What do you make of this?","This is coming on the heels of an interview on Univision in which he struggled with answering questions about Latin American issues:

“Look, you’re asking me questions about the impact on Central America, which honestly I should know more than I do know.”


“You are asking me questions about Latin America that I am very interested in but right now I’m running for president of the United States.""

What do you think about his inability to answer these questions? Does he think voters do not consider them to be important when compared to income inequality and the other issues he has primarily focused on? Will this hurt him in California?

"4jp2c4","Conservative","unknown","Political Correctness and Liberalism: The Downfall of Media","I think all of us here can agree that conservatives are oppressed by the media. We are silenced because of “bigotry” and “bullying”, even though what we are saying is purely opinionated and non-threatening. I’ve decided to make this post because I want to show multiple examples of how the liberal media is taking over free speech. The first example is the well-known Facebook page “I F***ing Love Science”. As a person who likes to keep up to date with science when it comes to updates on the ninth planet or a new species of animal being discovered, it sickens me to see some of their more recent “science” posts. IFLScience has shifted from a science outlet to a click-hungry, borderline BuzzFeed-cringey, liberal circle jerk that posts real science from time to time. The two that come to mind are “Five Reasons Not To Care About Climate Change” (http://www.iflscience.com/environment/five-reasons-not-care-about-climate-change) and “Study Suggests Conservatives Are More Susceptible To Bullsh*t” (http://www.iflscience.com/brain/are-conservatives-more-susceptible-bullsht). It’s no surprise that the page is run by liberals, but they seem to misunderstand what science is. The first article blatantly attacks anyone who does not believe climate change is a problem, completely ignoring the viable arguments an opposer to climate change may have. Science is, according to the Webster Dictionary, “knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation”, yet this article just accuses skeptics of being animal hating degenerates. Nice facts! On to the second article, the real treat. A “study” was done to measure one’s “BRS”, or “bullsh*t receptivity scale”, by getting conservatives and liberals twenty statements - half of which are said to be “bullsh*t” by the authors, and the other half “mundane” (although the article fails to state what is determined to be “bullsh*t”, probably because they would lose what little credibility they had) - and seeing how they would respond. As you can see, instead of spreading information, like what science is meant to do, they are just executing a liberal agenda. Moving on from that cringe-worthy organization, I’m going to assume you heard about the live debate challenge by Milo Yiannopoulos with Mark Zuckerberg on limiting conservative articles on Facebook. If you haven’t heard, Facebook has been limiting the spread of conservative journalism from websites such as Breitbart. On top of this, Zuckerberg has also been working with Angela Merkel to silence any Germans who have something to say - even logical arguments with an absence of bigotry - about the refugee crisis. Whether you love him or hate him, you can’t deny what Milo is saying is right. There is a huge problem with free speech in social media, and it has gotten to the point of senate involvement. That is just the media itself censoring ideas based on BS PC standards. But the consumers are also contributing to the madness. This is the event that pushed me over the tipping point. Only a few hours ago, Facebook has taken down conservative Christian podcaster, The Dirty Christian’s, page because of reports of “bullying” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBVLf92pQ4). I don’t know the full story behind this, but it appears to be some doing of overly-PC SJWs. Based off of what I’ve seen from the podcaster, he is someone who is not afraid to state his opinion, but will do so in a reasonable, calm, and respectable manner. It is time for an awakening for the world to reveal the lies of liberal media and the agenda to erase conservatism off the face of the Earth…

Much easier said than done given the state of media.","2016-05-17 03:52:48","2","1","0.63","https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/4jp2c4/political_correctness_and_liberalism_the_downfall/","True","abtwitch99","1747873752.1647081","climate crisis","manual"
