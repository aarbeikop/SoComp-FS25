i guess the **tl;dr** of what im trying to get at, especially as an undergraduate college student, is whether folks who are already parents or planning families have taken practical actions out of their eco anxiety to shift what their families will look like (no kids, adopted kids, no more kids etc.)

\[*disclaimer*: ofc anything you reply to this **won't be used** in any article im just seeing what other folks outside of my friend group have considered on this. if you want to help with/talk to me about the possible article pls feel free to message me, would love to hear your perspective.\]","2019-03-26 14:31:52","34","78","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/b5qeq8/has_ecoanxiety_influenced_your/","True","cawf33_bean","1747921634.3995662","climate crisis","manual"

"b3w3di","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Should the Recycling Industry be Nationalized?","So recycling has been in the news, specifically the fact that China has basically almost stopped taking America’s trash in order to recycle it.

A little background....

> For nearly two decades, China has taken in extraordinary quantities of the world’s trash and relied on cheap labor to process it. More specifically, China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, at which point the country began accepting paper and plastic recycling from around the world, according to a February episode of the podcast 99 Percent Invisible. And according to a new report from Vox, by 2016, China was importing 40 million metric tons of recyclable products every year.

China implemented a policy called national sword and dramatically cut the amount of goods they take in.

The United States does not have a national recycling program.

> The U.S. used to make a fair bit of money from selling off its trash and recyclable goods. 
(Private U.S companies)
>But the real issue is what the country will do now, with its recyclable products piling up. There is no national recycling policy in the U.S., which means cities are without a plan to work together to manage domestic waste.

Now cities across the country are either stockpiling these goods or putting them in landfills.

For those cities waiting until market conditions to improve the outlook doesn’t look good...

> First, since the United States has to rely on other countries to buy the recyclables, the value of the commodity is staggeringly low. Over the course of 2017, the value of mixed paper dropped from $75 per ton in January to $25 per ton in December. 

Furthermore 
> The New York Times reported in May 2018 that in somes cases, 25% of all recyclables collected are sent to landfill.

The Privatized model of recycling is obviously in crisis. 

Should the American people demand a better system? Pollution, and the carbon footprint generated by just constantly creating new things instead of reusing them is obviously a bad thing. 

Can the United States create a national recycling industry to deal with this crisis, and would the American people support such an endeavor?

**When: March 5th at 3pm EST**

Hosted by: [Climate XChange](https://climate-xchange.org/)

It’s one of the most talked-about stories of 2019, and for good reason; it is a legitimate, comprehensive attempt to reshape our economy and combat the greatest crisis of our time. The Green New Deal, a suite of economic stimulus programs aiming to address climate change in an equitable way, has been dominating news headlines since its introduction last month. But what does it all really mean? Can this legislation actually pass? How does the GND affect ongoing carbon pricing efforts, and most importantly- the future of our planet?

Joining us to tackle these questions and many more are Evan Weber, the political director of the Sunrise Movement, and David Roberts, the renowned Vox climate change writer. Weber’s Sunrise Movement, a youth grassroots organization, has been leading the charge for strong climate action, and Roberts’ articles break down environmental policy with unprecedented clarity. We will be taking live questions from our listeners, so tune in to get your GND questions answered by two of the biggest names in the conversation.","2019-03-04 17:13:45","9","0","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/ax9jr5/free_webinar_a_green_new_deal_with_david_roberts/","True","noadalzell","1747922407.7794402","climate crisis","manual"

Interesting report out from the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership (NEEP) this month. I’m not generally a single-family housing guy, but I love the work NEEP does, and it is a massive sector that we can set-up to reduce carbon emissions. Almost like using residential solar in aggregate to fulfill ISO contacts. These guys do a lot with price-signaling to the grid. An example scenario here is something like this (this is from this report): \[HEMS is Home Energy Management System\]

>For example, a scenario could exist where a water heater is being dispatched to manage peak. The water heater may be “charged” or heated before an expected peak event, but if the “heat up” signal is sent to an electric water heater in a home with solar, the water heater may divert energy from solar that otherwise may have been used to condition air with an ASHP or run the clothes dryer or any number of other electrical end-uses. When the peak event actually happens, the home might need more electricity to balance those loads than if left unattended, and may even end up drawing additional electricity from the grid during the worst times. If a utility or grid is only interfacing with one piece of the system, there may be unintended consequences. The smart meter read at the end of a peak event may show little to no impact of the curtailment effort. If that scenario had instead interfaced with a HEMS, the HEMS would have better information on all smart end-uses within a home and would understand the need to avoid usage during a peak event. The HEMS could work to orchestrate when to charge what in order to keep the user, technologies, and grid balanced.

At any rate, here’s some things I thought were interesting

>**Impacts, Trends, and Policies**: Imagine a scenario where space and water heating have shifted towards electric-powered, but in the cold, cloudy, short days of New England winter, solar distributed generation is very limited. This scenario could cause a new overnight peak crisis in home heating needs. In occasions like this, it is paramount to have both battery storage and clean generation from non-solar sources (like wind) to meet the evolving needs of the grid.

&#x200B;

>**The Limits of Current Demand Response**. According to Advanced Energy Economy,30 there were 7.95 million customers in the U.S. on some type of time-varying rate (see Figure 13) at the end of 2016. Maryland leads the nation with more than 75 percent of its residential customers participate in time-differentiated rates. In California, the leader in both residential solar and ownership rates of electric vehicles, residential TOU rates will be the default option starting in 2019. Because of the large presence of DERS on the California grid, the consumer benefit for a HEMS that can manage various loads and pair them with low rates is very significant.

&#x200B;

They also did a section on Real World Examples and Case Studies, There’s a lot, but here’s a few I found interesting:

&#x200B;

>**foresee by NREL**. As the name implies, foresee seeks to use machine learning to predict the home's future energy consumption. Simulation studies of foresee were performed using residential field data from the Pacific Northwest, and results indicated a 7.6 percent whole-home energy savings, without requiring substantial behavioral change.

&#x200B;

>**Efficiency Vermont** has developed a Smart Thermostat Analytics Toolkit (STAT)41 that pulls in several data sources, including weather, thermostat, smart meter, and other household information, and runs an iterative analysis to, among other things, help identify homes that may be a good fit for additional Efficiency Vermont home retrofit programs. \[I happen to think this is great policy integration insofar as it’s really considering potential EE problems, adjusting accordingly and bringing in utility programs to make that problems easier to manage\]

&#x200B;

At the end here I wanted to clear up why I'm posting this here and not in r/energy. I think the energy guys are away of this, and they do a piss-poor job of getting things like this in at the planning stage. Retrofits are great, but the people building neighborhoods need to know what we're talking about over here and integrate it with their overarching proposals.

&#x200B;

I personally would hope that you're working on multi-family, which is the reason I wake up in the morning, but since SFDH is a necessary evil in 2019, you need to fight climate change on every battle field you can.","2019-03-26 19:22:54","3","0","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/b5tzvv/the_smart_energy_home_driving_residential/","True","SilverCyclist","1747922618.631197","climate crisis","manual"
"azkg1g","conspiracy","unknown","The Truth About Climate Change","We’ve all come across the images of polar bears drifting on ice floes: emblematic victims of the global warming that’s melting the polar ice caps, symbols of the threat to the earth posed by our ceaseless energy production—above all, the carbon dioxide that factories and automobiles emit. We hear louder and louder demands to impose limits, to change our wasteful ways, so as to save not only the bears but also the planet and ourselves.

In political discourse and in the media, major storms and floods typically get presented as signs of impending doom, accompanied by invocations to the environment and calls to respect Mother Nature. Only catastrophes seem to grab our attention, though, and it’s rarely mentioned that warming would also bring some benefits, such as expanded production of grains in previously frozen regions of Canada and Russia. Nor do we hear that people die more often of cold weather than of hot weather. Isolated voices criticize the alarm over global warming, considering it a pseudoscientific thesis, the true aim of which is to thwart economic modernization and free-market growth and to extend the power of states over individual choices.

Not being a climatologist myself, I’ve always had trouble deciding between these arguments. And then I met Judith Curry at her home in Reno, Nevada. Curry is a true climatologist. She once headed the department of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, until she gave up on the academy so that she could express herself independently. “Independence of mind and climatology have become incompatible,” she says. Do you mean that global warming isn’t real? I ask. “There is warming, but we don’t really understand its causes,” she says. “The human factor and carbon dioxide, in particular, contribute to warming, but how much is the subject of intense scientific debate.”

Curry is a scholar, not a pundit. Unlike many political and journalistic oracles, she never opines without proof. And she has data at her command. She tells me, for example, that between 1910 and 1940, the planet warmed during a climatic episode that resembles our own, down to the degree. The warming can’t be blamed on industry, she argues, because back then, most of the carbon-dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels were small. In fact, Curry says, “almost half of the warming observed in the twentieth century came about in the first half of the century, before carbon-dioxide emissions became large.” Natural factors thus had to be the cause. 

None of the climate models used by scientists now working for the United Nations can explain this older trend. Nor can these models explain why the climate suddenly cooled between 1950 and 1970, giving rise to widespread warnings about the onset of a new ice age. I recall magazine covers of the late 1960s or early 1970s depicting the planet in the grip of an annihilating deep freeze. According to a group of scientists, we faced an apocalyptic environmental scenario—but the opposite of the current one.

But aren’t oceans rising today, I counter, eroding shorelines and threatening to flood lower-lying population centers and entire inhabited islands? “Yes,” Curry replies. “Sea level is rising, but this has been gradually happening since the 1860s; we don’t yet observe any significant acceleration of this process in our time.” Here again, one must consider the possibility that the causes for rising sea levels are partly or mostly natural, which isn’t surprising, says Curry, for “climate change is a complex and poorly understood phenomenon, with so many processes involved.” To blame human-emitted carbon dioxide entirely may not be scientific, she continues, but “some find it reassuring to believe that we have mastered the subject.” She says that “nothing upsets many scientists like uncertainty.”

This brings us to why Curry left the world of the academy and government-funded research. 

#“Climatology has become a political party with totalitarian tendencies,” she charges. “If you don’t support the UN consensus on human-caused global warming, if you express the slightest skepticism, you are a ‘climate-change denier,’ a stooge of Donald Trump, a quasi-fascist who must be banned from the scientific community.” 

These days, the climatology mainstream accepts only data that reinforce its hypothesis that humanity is behind global warming. Those daring to take an interest in possible natural causes of climactic variation—such as solar shifts or the earth’s oscillations—aren’t well regarded in the scientific community, to put it mildly. The rhetoric of the alarmists, it’s worth noting, has increasingly moved from “global warming” to “climate change,” which can mean anything. That shift got its start back in 1992, when the UN widened its range of environmental concern to include every change that human activities might be causing in nature, casting a net so wide that few human actions could escape it.

Scientific research should be based on skepticism, on the constant reconsideration of accepted ideas: at least, this is what I learned from my mentor, the ultimate scientific philosopher of our time, Karl Popper. 

#What could lead climate scientists to betray the very essence of their calling? The answer, Curry contends: “politics, money, and fame.” 

Scientists are human beings, with human motives; nowadays, public funding, scientific awards, and academic promotions go to the environmentally correct. 

**Among climatologists, Curry explains, “a person must not like capitalism or industrial development too much and should favor world government, rather than nations”; think differently, and you’ll find yourself ostracized. “Climatology is becoming an increasingly dubious science, serving a political project,” she complains. In other words, “the policy cart is leading the scientific horse.”**

#""Nowadays, public funding, scientific awards, and academic promotions go to the environmentally correct.”


This has long been true in environmental science, she points out. The global warming controversy began back in 1973, during the Gulf oil embargo, which unleashed fear, especially in the United States, that the supply of petroleum would run out. The nuclear industry, Curry says, took advantage of the situation to make its case for nuclear energy as the best alternative, and it began to subsidize ecological movements hostile to coal and oil, which it has been doing ever since. The warming narrative was born.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration played a role in the propagation of that narrative. Having ended its lunar expeditions, NASA was looking for a new mission, so it built some provisional climate models that focused primarily on carbon dioxide, because this is an easy factor to single out and “because it is subject to human control,” observes Curry. Even though it is just one among many factors that cause climate variations, carbon dioxide increasingly became the villain. Bureaucratic forces at the UN that promote global governance—by the UN, needless to say—got behind this line of research. 

Then the scientists were called upon and given incentives to prove that such a political project was scientifically necessary, recalls Curry. The UN founded the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 to push this agenda, and ever since, climatologists—an increasingly visible and thriving group—have embraced the faith.

In 2005, I had a conversation with Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian railway engineer, who remade himself into a climatologist and became director of the IPCC, which received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize under his tenure. Pachauri told me, without embarrassment, that, at the UN, he recruited only climatologists convinced of the carbon-dioxide warming explanation, excluding all others. This extraordinary collusion today allows politicians and commentators to declare that “science says that” carbon dioxide is to blame for global warming, or that a “scientific consensus” exists on warming, implying that no further study is needed—something that makes zero sense on its face, as scientific research is not based on consensus but on contradictory views.

Curry is skeptical about any positive results that might follow from environmental treaties—above all, the 2016 Paris Climate Accord. By the accord’s terms, the signatory nations—not including the United States, which has withdrawn from the pact—have committed themselves to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in order to stabilize the planet’s temperature at roughly its present level. Yet as Curry elaborates, **even if all the states respected this commitment—an unlikely prospect—the temperature reduction in 2100 would be an insignificant two-tenths of a degree. And this assumes that climate-model predictions are correct.** If there is less future warming than projected, the temperature reductions from limiting emissions would be even smaller.

Since the Paris Climate Accord was concluded, no government has followed through with any serious action. The U.S. pullout is hardly the only problem; India is effectively ignoring the agreement, and France “misses its goals of greenhouse-gas reduction every year,” admits Nicolas Hulot, the French environmental activist and former minister for President Emmanuel Macron. The accord is unenforceable and carries no sanctions—a condition insisted upon by many governments that wouldn’t have signed on otherwise. We continue to live in a contradictory reality: on the one hand, we hear that nothing threatens humanity as much as rising atmospheric carbon dioxide; on the other hand, nothing much happens practically to address this allegedly dire threat. Most economists suggest that the only effective incentive to reduce greenhouse-gas levels would be to impose a global carbon tax. No government seems willing to accept such a levy.

Is there an apocalyptic warming crisis, or not? “We’re always being told that we are reaching a point of no return—that, for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice pack is the beginning of the apocalypse,” Curry says. “But this melting, which started decades ago, is not leading to catastrophe.” Polar bears themselves adapt and move elsewhere and have never been more numerous; they’re less threatened by the melting, she says, than by urbanization and economic development in the polar region. Over the last year or so, moreover, the planet has started cooling, though “no one knows whether it will last or not, or whether it will put all the global-warming hypotheses in question.” 

According to Curry, the truly dramatic rupture of the ice pack would come not from global-warming-induced melting but from “volcanic eruptions in the Antarctic region that would break up the ice, and these cannot be predicted.” Climatologists don’t talk about such eruptions because their theoretical models can’t account for the unpredictable.

Does Curry recommend passivity, then? Not at all. In her view, research should be diversified to encompass study of the natural causes of climate change and not focus so obsessively on the human factor. She also believes that, instead of wasting time on futile treaties and in sterile quarrels, we would do better to prepare ourselves for the consequences of climate change, whether it’s warming or something else. 

Despite outcries about the proliferation of extreme weather incidents, she points out, hurricanes usually do less damage today than in the past because warning systems and evacuation planning have improved. That suggests the right approach.

Curry’s pragmatism may not win acclaim in environmentalist circles or among liberal pundits, though no one effectively contests the validity of her research or rebuts the data that she cites about an exceedingly complex reality. But then, neither reality nor complexity mobilizes passions as much as myths do, which is why Judith Curry’s work is so important today. She is a myth-buster.
