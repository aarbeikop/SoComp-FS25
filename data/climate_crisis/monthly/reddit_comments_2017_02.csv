In my anecdotal experience, living in a liberal part of a liberal state, people simply don’t know that animal agriculture is such a huge contributor to climate change, and they have no idea of its role in the health crisis. But outside of my experience, it’s not hard to realize that that’s the general experience across the US and around the globe. Look at the news headlines we see every day. Even the most liberal/progressive news sources barely mention animal agriculture in their articles on climate change. We hear about the refugee crisis, the healthcare crisis, the environmental crisis, wars, trade, climate disasters, crime, etc. but there’s hardly a mention of animal agriculture. Even health columns don’t recommend a vegetarian or vegan diet, they just recommend you cut down on red meat and eat more lean meats like fish and chicken. Carnism is so deeply rooted in our society that even acknowledging its existence is revolutionary.

So invisibility is the first part of the problem, I think the second part is acknowledgement. Once we’ve seen the cause of the problem, we have to actually accept that that’s the case. The issue here is, I think, the normativity of animal consumption and its effects. People won’t look around and say it’s abnormal for people to be so sick because, to them, it simply isn’t. Many people grow up with obese parents, lose their grandparents to cardiovascular disease, and then grow to be obese and diabetic themselves. And that’s *normal*, it’s “family history,” it’s not the cheeseburger you had for lunch, or the soda you drank on the couch, it’s that Uncle Bob also had a heart attack at 45 and that’s *just the way things are*. We’ve become so complacent in our lifestyles that trying to make a change seems impossible.

The good news is that we are starting to see a shift. More and more people are starting to look around and question if this is really is normal. More people are going vegetarian and vegan, and as more people do that it’s becoming more normal. The more vegans the average person interacts with, the less likely they are to dismiss veganism as a fringe group of crazies. The rise in vegan food options is a great example of this shift, as are the increasing numbers of articles we see in reasonably mainstream (if still very left) news sources. I think we’re at the very beginning of a much larger shift. It will happen slowly, but I think we’re getting closer and closer to the tipping point.","2017-02-13 19:55:07","28","InnocenceMyBrother","1747887055.06008","climate crisis","manual"

"ddpoqad","t3_5tuz5g","5tuz5g","vegan","unknown","> How long until doctors and the establishment finally start recommending people go vegetarian or vegan?

Even if they did, most people would probably ignore them.  

Many doctors TODAY recommend cutting back on cheese & red meat.  They tell people to exercise more and lose weight and get more fiber too, but it doesn't seem to be having much of an impact, if you look at the health stats.

> 70%+ of people in the USA are overweight.

A lot of that number has to do with BMI calculations I think, and might be somewhat misleading.

I'm 5'10"", 180lbs - not a big guy - but my BMI is 25.8 so I'm technically overweight (the cutoff is 25).  I eat very healthy and I jog and hike and go camping and am pretty active within the confines of having a 9-5 desk job and long commute.  But I'm still in that 70% statistic.

Overweight doesn't always mean unhealthy or lazy. ","2017-02-14 01:36:44","2","anachronic","1747887055.0672","climate crisis","manual"
