If you know about it, feel free to skip to my analysis beneath that.

> William Strauss and Neil Howe wrote a series of books in the 1990s that analyzed history in a new way: cyclically, rather than in a linear fashion.

> As far back as the 1400s, there have been four stages that society continues to pass through.  They call these stages ""turnings"".  Each turning lasts about 20 years (give or take), and the whole cycle lasts a bit over 80 years - the course of a long human lifetime.

> The 1st Turning is a ""**High**"".  In this period, institutions are strong and individualism is weak.  People work together, and the sense of community is strong, but spiritual depth and diversity are somewhat muted.  The most recent 1st Turning we experienced was ""Superpower America"", the post-war boom of 1943-1960.

> The 2nd Turning is an ""**Awakening**"".  Children who grew up during the high are now becoming young adults, and they feel disenchanted with what they see as a superficial and oppressive system.  They rebel against the government, against institutions, and against their parents, and fight for individual expression and freedom from control.  The most recent Awakening was the ""Consciousness Revolution"" of 1961-1980.

> The 3rd Turning is an ""**Unraveling**"".  Due to the efforts of young adults during the Awakening period, institutions are now weak and individualism is high.  ""Every man for himself"" is the motto.  Individual identity is strong, but cultural identity and a sense of community are weak.  The most recent 3rd Turning was the ""Culture Wars"" (Dems. versus Reps.) and ""Postmodernism"" from 1982-2004.

> The 4th Turning is a ""**Crisis**"".  This is when the problems of the 3rd Turning come to a head, and people start to band together to overcome them.  They tear down old, decaying institutions and start rebuilding them.  They band together to fix their problems.  This leads to the ""High"" of the next 1st Turning.  The most recent 4th Turning was the Great Depression and World War II from 1925-1942.  Before that, it was the Civil War (1843-1865), and before that it was the American Revolution (1767–1791).  Like I said, these cycles can be traced all the way back to the 1400s, so click through to the Wiki link above to see more about how our history falls into this pattern.

> Strauss and Howe predicted in 1997 that the next 4th Turning - the crisis-  would begin with a spark somewhere around 2005, give or take a few years.  Quote from their book: ""**In retrospect, the spark might seem as ominous as a financial crash, as ordinary as a national election, or as trivial as a Tea Party.** The catalyst will unfold according to a basic Crisis dynamic that underlies all of these scenarios: An initial spark will trigger a chain reaction of unyielding responses and further emergencies.""  Eerily prescient, no?

> The other thing to understand about this theory is that history not only goes in cycles, but so do generational attitudes.  The events that happen during a generation's childhood, young adulthood, midlife, and elderhood affect how that generation views the world, how it views themselves, and how it views people from other generations.  There are four generational archetypes which coincide with which Turning they came of age.

> * The **Hero** archetype is born during an Unraveling and comes of age during a Crisis.  They tend to be civic-minded, optimistic, and collectivist.  The most recent Hero generations were the G.I. generation (born 1901-1924 and fought in WWII) and the current crop of Millenials (b. 1982-2004).
> * The **Artist** archetype is born during a Crisis and comes of Age during a High.  They tend to be well-socialized, conformist, and process-oriented.  Basically, they tend to work hard and do what is expected of them.  The most recent Artist generation was the Silent Generation (b. 1925-1942).  Don Draper, Joan Holloway, and Pete Campbell from Mad Men represent this generation well.
> * The **Prophet** archetype is born during a High and comes of age during an Awakening.  They have no memory of the Crisis period that led to the high.  They tend to be idealistic, moralistic, and socially fractured.  The current coming of the Prophet archetype are Baby Boomers (b. 1943-1960).
> * The **Nomad** archetype is born during an Awakening and comes of age during a Crisis.  They were generally left alone and ignored during their childhood, and don't have any memories of a ""High"" period when everyone got along.  They tend to be alienated, survivalist, and pragmatic.  The current Nomad generation is Generation X (b. 1961-1981).

Alright, still with me?  If so, here is how I envision the current political landscape:

We are in a period of Crisis (the financial crisis, potentially with a looming total war or other great challenge that we haven't yet predicted in the next decade).  The crisis stemmed mainly from the individualist, anti-regulation (""You can't tell me what to do!"") policies enacted by the Baby Boomers in the 80s when they came into power, and that have continued to today.  The fractured infighting of liberals vs. conservatives is very typical of a Prophet generation.

This is not the first time it's happened.  In the previous Crisis (Great Depression & World War II), it was the over-speculation of the previous Prophet generation (Missionary Generation b. 1860–1882) and their moralistic and socially divisive policies (Prohibition, reconstruction after World War I) that lead to the Crisis.  The trend continues backward.

The current Nomad generation (Gen X) has felt alienated and disillusioned by the lack of societal support, but they are starting to come into their own as midlife leaders.  Obama is one of the oldest Gen Xers around.  Nomad generals (Patton, Eisenhower) led Hero soldiers in World War II - their practicality and grit gives realistic and useful guidance to the optimistic and energetic young Hero generations.

So here's my question - in the upcoming election, what *kind* of leader do we need to see us through this crisis?  Obviously, any Millenials are too Young, and with John McCain's defeat it seems we will never have a Silent Generation president.  So - if we go off historial precedent, do we want a president who is a:

* **Baby Boomer?** (Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Hillary Clinton, Andrew Cuomo, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Elizabeth Warren, Jim Webb)

* or **Gen X**? (Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Martin O'Malley, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Scott Walker)

* or do we give an old but hardworking **Silent Generation** candidate (Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders) a shot?

Do we cling to the ideals of the Prophet generation, or the pragmatism of the Nomad generation?

Let's look at who led the Anglo-American society through past Crises for an idea.

1. **Crisis: War of the Roses**, 1461-1482

    Leaders: Edward IV (Hero), Henry VI (Nomad), Edward IV again

    Result: The Tudor Renaissance 

2. **Crisis: Armada Crisis**, 1566-1587

    Leader: Elizabeth I (Nomad)

    Result: Merrie England

3. **Crisis: King Philip's War & the Glorious Revolution**, 1674–1700

    Leaders: Charles II (Nomad), James II (Nomad), Mary II (Hero), William III (Hero)

    Result: The Augustan Age of Empire

4. **Crisis: American Revolution**, 1767–1791

    Leaders: England: George III (Nomad), George Washington (Nomad)

    Result: The Era of Good Feeling

5. **Crisis: American Civil War**, 1843–1865

    Leaders: John Tyler (Artist), James K. Polk (Prophet), Zachary Taylor (Artist), Millard Fillmore (Prophet), Franklin Pierce (Prophet), James Buchanan (Artist), Abraham Lincoln (Prophet)

    Result: It is argued that this Crisis came too early and ended up scarring children during this time instead of empowering them.  That said, this seems to be a fault of leaders during what should have been the unraveling period (all listed above except Lincoln).  We were robbed of a Hero generation, but the end result of the war was the Reconstruction & The Gilded Age

6. **Crisis: The Great Depression & World War II**, 1925–1942

    Leaders: US: Calvin Coolidge (Prophet), Herbert Hoover (Prophet), Franklin D. Roosevelt (cusp of Prophet and Nomad); UK: Stanley Baldwin(Prophet), Ramsay MacDonald (Prophet), Neville Chamberlain (Prophet), Winston Churchill (Prophet)
    Result: Superpower America

7. **Crisis: The Great Recession, Climate Change, The War on Terror**, 2005–present

    Leaders: US: George W. Bush (Prophet), Barack Obama (cusp of Prophet and Nomad), ???; UK: Tony Blair (Prophet), Gordon Brown (Prophet), David Cameron (Nomad), ???

    Result: ???

I was hoping to come out of all this work with more to show, but all I seemed to have found was that people come into power older now than they used to lol.  Judging by the Civil War mess I do think we should stay away from Artists, though, so goodbye Biden and Sanders (as if they had a shot...).

Is there anything else you can pull out of this data?

Happy to answer questions about the theory or discuss its relevance to the issue, although I'd like to have a discussion around the *assumption that it's true* rather than debating its validity per se!

Have at it. :)","2015-01-22 06:07:48","20","35","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2t9hd6/strausshowe_generational_theory_and_its/","True","peppermint-kiss","1747849578.0331352","climate crisis","manual"
