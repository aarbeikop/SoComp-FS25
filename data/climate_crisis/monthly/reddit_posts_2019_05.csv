Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.

Coal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).

A problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people. In theory, Coal India is obligated to provide employment to these displaced people, but has only managed to provide jobs for a small [minority](https://books.google.com/books?id=BxDKhOnWwOsC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=tribe++employment+%22coal+india%22&source=bl&ots=mKvZZWjGxn&sig=ACfU3U2jNdOszeIC3kEvO_E3Ft7pU3xKtA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwii5fKs-YPiAhUDMawKHcwOC-Y4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=tribe%20%20employment%20%22coal%20india%22&f=false), while pollution has impacted the livelihoods of many who . Many adivasi people have turned to the Naxalites, a radical and [violent ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Maoists-trigger-train-crash-100-die/articleshow/5985997.cms)Maoist terrorist group, out of desperation and many ordinary people have been [caught ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/bastar-tribals-raise-their-voices-against-naxal-atrocities-118032900569_1.html)in the [crossfire](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/chhattisgarh-activists-up-against-salwa-judum-atrocities-107090601020_1.html). While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.

India's coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States. Nevertheless, coal is likely to be king for the foreseeable future. Millions of Indians are [buying ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-in-indias-passenger-vehicle-market)their first cars every year, while India produces vast quantities of carbon [intensive ](https://www.devalt.org/newsletter/jan97/of_1.htm)products such as cement and steel. Most importantly, coal consumption is rising rapidly in India. The International Energy Agency projects coal use in India will [increase ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/iea-china-and-india-to-fuel-further-rise-in-global-coal-demand-in-2018)from 563 to 708 million metric tons, with total coal consumption increasing by more than 3% a year. Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015. India [emitted ](https://www.axios.com/china-india-us-pushed-carbon-emissions-to-record-levels-in-2018-1b1e171a-d46a-49b7-bc4a-7250942a1a7d.html)2.6 billion of the worlds total 15.3 billion . While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.

India's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.

"blniik","environmental_science","unknown","Undergrad (N. America) seeking Environmental Chemistry grad school advice","Hi there!  I'm hoping my fellow environmental scientists might be able to help me out:

I'm a chem. undergraduate doing research at the crossroads of two fields: Chemical Oceanography and Chemistry, and I'll soon be applying to graduate schools. **My question is about which of the various fields to get a PhD in:** Analytical Chemistry (typical chem dept.), Geochemistry, Environmental Chemistry (only a few schools in N.A.), Limnology/Oceanography... the list goes on. Clearly, I need to pick a field before narrowing down schools based on their labs.

Why am I shooting for a PhD, you ask? 1) Because I freaking love research. I have three papers in the works/in review, and it excites me. 2) Because I want to make an impact on our global crisis of climate change through scientific research/industry work.

Here's the problem: I don't know if joining a dept. of geosciences or Earth sciences as a grad student will get me where I want to be. However, there are precious few opportunities for environmental chemistry in actual chemistry departments, which typically try to fit the envirochemists into the box of analytical/physical. **If I want to study the Earth as a chemist (not to mention have a decent shot at a job in the future!), where do I belong?**

I appreciate any advice.

"bkgue7","vegan","unknown","How Does One Best Pursue Intimacy With Non-Vegans Without Getting Too Angry and/or Sad?","I’m a mid 20s female who already has a few non negotiable “deal breakers” when it comes to considering new romantic partners, that end up counting out a good amount of the population: 1) I’m poly and have no interest in settling down into a traditionally structured monogamous relationship; 2) I can’t imagine dating someone really religious or 3) conservative. 

In my heart, I want to add being vegan to the list of non-negotiables for a partner, but I also have to be realistic about how much further that would deplete my “pool,” so to speak, than it already has been from the previous imperatives listed above. 

So that brings me to my question: for those of y’all who are vegan and either have a non-vegan partner currently or at least consider yourself open to dating one, how do you deal?

Although the health benefits are great, yeah, I’d definitely say that I am vegan for the animals and the environment - with about equally strong passion towards both causes. Since I work in the environmental world, I find it endlessly frustrating how few colleagues of mine are vegan themselves, and many don’t even want to discuss the issue at all. When I am reading all these reports about the devastating impact that mass animal agriculture has on our environment, in junction with how few years we have left to try to turn things around with the climate crisis, it just makes it really difficult to relate to people who are unwilling to make the change towards becoming vegan. 

Enough of my rambling though...I mostly just wanna know, how do y’all deal? Advice and suggestions much appreciated :)","2019-05-04 03:05:08","4","4","0.74","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/bkgue7/how_does_one_best_pursue_intimacy_with_nonvegans/","True","gravityyalwayyswins","1747925461.6713228","climate crisis","manual"
