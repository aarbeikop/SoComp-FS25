"ct8ynwg","t3_3dukvy","3dukvy","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Because, while the general public knew about most of the mega-disasters Obama was inheriting back in 2008, there was one mega-disaster only the politically savvy knew about: the U.S. political system. The system had been in terrible shape for years and was only getting worse. By 2008 the levels of partisanship/polarization/congressional productivity/filibusters were already at extremes not seen in generations - even since the Civil War. I was that one-in-a-thousand person in 2008 who was more worried about the state of the political system than the economy, and even I have been surprised at how bad it's gotten. The rest of this response get's more partisan. It's just honestly what I think.

One thought stayed in my head back in 2008 more than any other: “Does Obama realize how bad the GOP is getting?” Over the preceding years I'd been trying to figure out why the Bush administration had gone so wrong. My basic conclusion was that the [GOP had become too extreme](http://i.imgur.com/5s8puNj.jpg). That divergence you see in the graph is the main reason it's so hard to get things done in congress these days: the two parties are farther apart than ever. No one foresaw just how badly the system would degenerate during Obama's presidency, especially after the GOP retook the House in 2010, but I think Obama understood that he needed to act fast in his first two years and get what he could. Obama only had his quasi-super-majority because of personal dynamism, Bush and the economy; and it was a very fragile thing. The story of the ACA says it all. It seems almost forgotten already, but most of the conservative “blue dog” Democrats who were critical to passing the ACA, and why it had to be so conservative, were wiped out in 2010. That should tell you just how narrow Obama's window really was for getting anything remotely progressive passed. The ACA, despite being so conservative many liberals are embarrassed by it, only passed, and has only survived, by the skin of its teeth.

The GOP's [obstruction strategy](http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/23/the-party-of-no-new-details-on-the-gop-plot-to-obstruct-obama/) was really a natural outgrowth of their rightward, southward shift that's been going on for generations. Obama - an intellectual, brown, northern college professor with a  Mulsim-ish name - ticked too many boxes on the list of conservative phobias, and was genuinely just too much of a political threat. They couldn't risk him being perceived as a bridger of political divides and healer of the country if they worked with him and things got better. It would've undercut their ideological message, as well as the racial and cultural animosities that fuel their party. Obama had to be the false idol – the false liberal prophet. A deeply ugly scheme to be sure, but one that just made too much sense if you're the GOP.","2015-07-19 20:52:02","6","Aumah","1747858482.901448","climate crisis","manual"
"ct8rzf4","t3_3dukvy","3dukvy","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","It's because the number of Democrats or Democrat-leaning voting members in the Senate wasn't filibuster-proof.  The Republicans used the filibuster very often to derail potential legislation that Obama had called for, and it very nearly doomed the passage of the ACA too.  However, by some miracle, Arlen Specter switched to the Democratic party during that particular term.  The Dems still had other problems in getting sufficient filibuster-proof votes, such as Al Franken's election recount and the empty seats left by Robert Byrd and Ted Kennedy.  Byrd was able to come back but Kennedy needed to be replaced entirely, but during those periods, the Democrats were short of 60 Senate votes for a while.  

This [link sums of much of what I said pretty well I think.](http://cjonline.com/blog-post/lucinda/2012-06-01/no-obama-did-not-control-congress-his-first-two-years)  

TL;DR it's not enough to have a sitting president to have majorities in both chambers of congress to get the legislation he wants passed.  Sometimes it requires filibuster-proof majorities.
