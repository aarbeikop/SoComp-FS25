"45ygx0","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","I don't believe Bernie Sanders will be able to accomplish anything with a republican congress if elected President.","Hi guys. I'd very much like to preamble this post by saying that the following is not to say that the other candidates are better, it's just my opinion of Mr. Sanders' position as the ""least-worst"" candidate.

Anyway, let's get to it. I'm sourcing all of his points from [his website](https://berniesanders.com/?nosplash=true/) under the ""[issues](https://berniesanders.com/issues)"" page. I'll break down point by point on where I see a flaw or lack in logic or possibility of actually happening. I'll also acknowledge each point I agree with.

 - **Income and Wealth inequality**

I acknowledge that there is a large difference between the income of the 1% and the bottom 99%. I'd really like to focus on this paragraph:

> Despite huge advancements in technology and productivity, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. The real median **income of male workers is $783 less than it was 42 years ago**; while the real median **income of female workers is over $1,300 less than it was in 2007**. That is unacceptable and that has got to change.

See, a *lot* of politicians love to talk about how men earn more than women to make themselves appeal to a wider group of voters. If you really look at it though, it makes no sense at all. If we were to apply the logic that women get paid less, then businesses would ONLY hire women, because they're cheap labor. This is obviously not the case, so if we were to apply the logic further then we would conclude that even though they're cheap labor, businesses hire more men because they're smarter and better at conducting business. This is also very obviously not the case.

The statistics factored into fueling this myth only account for the average earnings of all men and women that work full-time. It does *not* account for differences in occupations, education, positions, or hours worked per week. 

[Here's an article you can read on that](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html).

 - **It’s Time to Make College Tuition Free and Debt Free**

[Here's a great article/summary](http://www.investors.com/politics/capital-hill/heres-what-bernie-sanders-doesnt-want-you-to-know-about-college-costs/) of a study by economists Grey Gordon and Aaron Hedlund. I especially enjoyed the closing sentence; ""But who has time for such inconvenient truths when a presidential contender is waiving a banner saying 'free stuff.'""

I recommend you read the article for yourself, but basically what it is saying is that the real culprit for the rise in college costs is federal aid. 

> ""What did account for almost all of it was, ironically enough, the massive explosion in federal aid over the past several decades. Federal aid — in the form of subsidized loans, grants and tax credits — shot up 134% in the past 15 years, according to the College Board. It’s climbed 22% just under President Obama.""

After seeing these kinds of things brought to light, it's really hard to support Bernie (in this topic).

 - **Getting Big Money Out of Politics and Restoring Democracy** 

This one is pretty much spot on. I have no complaints. I have no idea how he'll do it, but I have no complaints.

 - **Creating Jobs Rebuilding America**

From [his page](https://berniesanders.com/issues/creating-jobs-rebuilding-america/);

> ""Today, the U.S. spends less than 2 percent of GDP on infrastructure, less than at any point in the last twenty years. Meanwhile, Europe spends close to twice our rate, and China spends close to four times our rate.""

Notice how he doesn't specify which countries in Europe. If he's using an average to get that number, then that'd mean that some are lower and some are higher. Also notice how he says that China spends close to four times our rate. Well, guess what Bernie, China makes literal ghost ~~towns~~ [cities](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/07/20/what-will-become-of-chinas-ghost-cities/#6f292224751b) where nobody lives and is now questioning its economy's ability to grow. Some of its workers are taking a raise in their pay and companies are leaving ([source](http://www.dw.com/en/us-firms-moving-out-of-china/a-18994088)), meaning all that infrastructure investment is at a huge risk of being for nothing. China should not be a comparison. 

Anyone that understands the economic situation in China or cares even the slightest bit to look into it can ""debunk"" Bernie's comparison. However, it is true that the U.S' current infrastructure is deteriorating heavily. 

> Senator Sanders’ Rebuild America Act would more than **double the current level of funding** for the highway and transit accounts of the Highway Trust Fund, and would ***create*** **a National Infrastructure Bank** to leverage **private capital** to finance more than $125 billion in new projects.

He's pretty ambitious about creating all these new channels of tax revenue. Almost all his plans are field by a ""to-be"" ""wishlist"" system of taxes. He'd have enormous trouble creating that bank, let alone getting it to function properly *on top of his proposed tax increases*. It just wouldn't work. If taxes are already being boosted across the board, then not many/enough people will want to poor even more money into his system. 

> Further, investing in infrastructure is not just about “bricks and mortar.”   At its core, it is about jobs and the economy.

> While the economy has improved significantly since the worst days of the recession, our nation still faces a major jobs crisis.  We need to **create millions of decent paying jobs**, and we need to create them now.  And infrastructure spending is one of the best ways to do just that.

So he'll create a higher minimum wage which will kill small businesses and franchises but he'll also raise the taxes so it'll cancel out a lot of the increase anyway. This is purely irrational thinking and there's an incredibly small chance he'll even get it passed the republican congress. If anything, create a mandate that minimum wage will be re-evaluated every three years to **keep up with inflation**, not to invent arbitrary numbers. People argue that if they raise minimum wage to $15, then kids can afford to fund their own college tuition. This is not the case at all. The cost of college tuition has far outrun $15 an hour. The only way to do it at this point would be to have minimum wage rise to inflation (much closer to $11) then reduce federal aid for college tuition, hence lowering what colleges can charge.

 - **A Living Wage**

Some issues listed on the [page](https://berniesanders.com/issues/a-living-wage/):

1. ""Millions of Americans are working for totally inadequate wages. We must ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty. The current federal minimum wage is starvation pay and must become a living wage. We must increase it to $15 an hour over the next several years.""

This makes sense for a Starbucks in Manhattan or a busy area where the revenue and workload is high enough to justify a $15 an hour pay. In some times of the year, some locations of X or Y restaurant won't make money for weeks on end. Other locations profit's are shared across the region to cover for lost revenue from those seasonal locations. An Outback Steakhouse in a beach town on the east coast will make huge amounts of money during the summer, but will ultimately be unprofitable during the winter months. Raising the wage wouldn't necessarily hurt those large chain restaurants, but it would destroy the prospects of small businesses that can't cover losses as easily (if at all). 

2. ""We must also establish equal pay for women. It’s unconscionable that women earn less than men for performing the same work.""

Yeah, we already covered this. It's truly shocking that people can't see past this pandering and makes me question the political awareness of Sanders supporters. If Sander's campaign slogan were more accurate, it wouldn't say ""Feel the Bern"", but much close to ""Sanders panders""

3. ""Millions of American employees have been working 50 or 60 hours a week while receiving no overtime pay. That is why Bernie has been encouraging the Obama Administration to ensure that more workers receive overtime pay protection.""

This is a good point, nothing really wrong here.

4. ""Led the effort to increase the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour."" 

And this is about where it should stop. A **50%** boost to $15 dollars is absolutely ridiculous for most franchises, let alone small businesses. That 50% adds up to five to six figure sums required of small businesses throughout the year and will undoubtedly lead to job loss and more burden on the welfare system.

 - **Combating Climate Change to Save the Planet**

I have no issue with the general direction but I do have a gripe with an aspect of his plan. On [this page](https://berniesanders.com/people-before-polluters/) under ""Invest in clean, sustainable energy"", Sanders lists replacements for coal energy as being ""energy efficiency, solar, wind and geothermal.""

If Bernie Sanders was as adamant about creating higher standards for the construction and safety of nuclear power plants as he is about taxing the rich and fixing gender-related wage gaps that don't really exist, then we would have the cleanest and most **cost-effective** energy grid on the planet.

 - **A Fair and Humane Immigration Policy**

This page was arranged weirdly in little bits that didn't really elaborate and only linked to ""Share on Twitter"" pages but if I had to pick one, I'd disagree with where it says ""Employ humanitarian parole to ensure the return of unjustly deported immigrants and unify broken families.""

Yeah, that's obviously a tough call. I'd honestly go the conservative route here. Just establish a filter process for some of the existing illegal immigrants to be deported, as it would be expensive to send them all back. While that's being done, limit new illegal immigrants otherwise the problem will repeat itself.

 - **Racial Justice**

In my opinion, a huge reason this issue is even being discussed on the level it's being discussed is because of Ferguson. 
 Two things about that: 

1. Nobody knows which party was actually in the wrong.

2. Nobody *forced* the people of Ferguson to riot. They did that on their own. It wasn't protesting, it was a full-on exploitation of chaos to steal things that didn't belong to them. They destroyed their city with an utter lack of logic and other poor African Americans (Can I just say black people?) across the country made the decision (along with, probably, a bit of the [mob mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality)) to ""protest"" and ultimately destroyed their own hometown. 

Aside from the reason it's such a hot-topic, I acknowledge that there is a chance that there's some truth behind what their initial issue was and that it should be addressed. But this idea that people think black lives don't matter is completely off-base and it's an issue which could be handled a *lot* better than it is being handled from BOTH parties.

 - **Fighting for Women’s Rights**

> Many of the achievements that have been made for women’s rights in the 20th century have been under attack by the Republican party — denying women control over their own bodies, preventing access to vital medical and social services, and blocking equal pay for equal work.

I agree with Bernie on this one. The GOP is valuing humans that have never seen the light of day over humans that are fully aware and able to make decisions for themselves. It's wrong and probably one of the few reasons why Bernie could still have my vote, on top of LGBT rights.

 - **Fighting for LGBT Equality**

I fit under the ""B"" of this, so I think you all can just understand where I stand on this.

***

 - **Caring for our Veterans**

This is a really important issue. 

> Sen. Sanders believes that just as planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war, so is taking care of the men and women who we sent off to fight the war.

This is very well put. The well being of our veterans should be very high on the list of priorities and I believe it's one of the few areas where the GOP and the Democrats can agree.

 - **Medicare for All**

It's another one of those grids that lead to Twitter share pages. I'll pick one like last time. 

> ""We must ensure all Americans can access the health care they need regardless of their income.""

I don't think I could agree more on this one. I don't know how Bernie will pull this off along with his other big issues, but I hope if he gets elected that he can thoroughly address this issue. One of my greatest fears is having an issue that I can't resolve due to financial limitations. For those of you Breaking Bad fans (so, pretty much all of you, in other words), the part where (and I'll try to mitigate spoiling it for those who have been living under a rock) a certain hairless, caucasian gets shot and needs therapy to walk again and he **can't afford** the program where it's most likely he'll heal was pretty scary to me. I can't imagine the future of my mobility being on the line due to financial shortcomings.

 - **Fighting for Disability Rights**

> “The Americans with Disabilities Act established a clear national mandate that we as a nation have a moral responsibility to ensure that all Americans have access to the programs and the support needed to contribute to society, live with dignity, and achieve a high quality of life.”

This is true and I agree with this point.

 - **Strengthen and Expand Social Security**

This is true and I hope that Social Security stops being a [piggy bank](http://dailysignal.com/2015/10/27/budget-deal-kicks-the-can-on-disability-insurance-robs-150-billion-from-social-security/) for other issues.

 - **Fighting to Lower Prescription Drug Prices**

I honestly think this should just fit under ""Medicare for all"", which I addressed above. Perhaps Sanders knew that too, but isolating this in the midst of the Shkreli issue would attract more voters. I do, though, think this is a more realistic issue for Sanders to fix than the Medicare for all idea.

***

***

 - **Improving the Rural Economy**

> Expand support for young and beginning farmers

""By raising their employees' minimum pay to $15, cutting into their profits and ruining any chance of that""


To be more serious, though, I hope he can do this. Part of the reason that young farms or even small-time farmers struggle compared to the big ""factory farms"" is the economy of scale. It's like Tesla's Gigafactory, but for crops and dairy instead of batteries and cars. Factory farm owners have the money to own huge amounts of land and invest to streamline production (although very cruel) to maximize profits. Perhaps tax breaks should be given to beginning farmers or farmers with small amounts of land but given the rest of Sanders' propositions, a tax break seems very unlikely.

 - **Reforming Wall Street**

I don't think that there's any way to actually ""break up the big banks"" but I do believe that there should be heavier restrictions on credit/mortgages, I believe the highest allowable debt-to-income is 43% annually. That's ridiculous. The cap should be in the high 30% range, and even that is questionable/dangerous. We do not need another housing bubble.

> Supports capping credit card interest rates at 15%.

This makes sense but seems more reactive than proactive. It should be implemented **along with** mandatory financial literacy classes for people signing up for a credit card. A big reason that some people find themselves in a place where they're paying that kind of interest rate is due to utter and complete financial illiteracy, by a huge amount of people in this country. 

***

 - **Real Family Values**

> we are the only nation that doesn’t require employers to provide at least 10 days of paid vacation time.

This should be implemented in **career level** positions. I'm not sure how realistic it is for a career McDonald's worker, but a person pursuing a career at a place they've worked hard for at a number of years should have this. I'm disappointed that he didn't elaborate on **how** he would reach this goal. He just talked about how bad it is and how great it would be. Seems like more pandering, honestly.

***

***

 - **War and Peace**

> Sen. Sanders **considers his vote against the Iraq War to be one of the most important he has cast**, and **believes that the invasion in Iraq was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in modern U.S. history**. As a leader in the opposition to the war in Iraq, much of what then Congressman Sanders feared would happen has, in fact, occurred.

See, this is what worries me. Sanders only really has experience voting yes, voting no, not really being held accountable for the decisions. Christ Christie got into this when grilling Rubio. In that paragraph, it just shows that all he has to show is how he feels about individual votes. It's a respectable position (as Chris Christie said), but it just appears in these situations that it won't prepare him to become the President.

 - **War Should Be the Last Option: Why I Support the Iran Deal**

To be perfectly honest, I never kept up with the news about the Iran Deal so I think it'd be unfair for me to state an opinion of something I have really no idea about.

 - **Making the Wealthy, Wall Street, and Large Corporations Pay their Fair Share**

> Even worse, several large corporations in recent years have exploited so many loopholes in the tax code that they have paid nothing in federal income taxes and have actually received tax rebates from the IRS.

Yeah, this should be fixed for sure. 

> Senator Sanders would prevent corporations that are American for all practical purposes from avoiding U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company through the establishment of a post office box in a tax haven country.

This may cause the companies to flee the U.S. and establish legitimate headquarters there. This would mean that they'd be gone for good. I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I feel Trump would handle this issue the best of all the candidates. I don't like him, but he has top notch experience in that area and can negotiate from the perspective of someone who has experienced, rather than humble Sanders who prides himself in *not* experiencing it. This could lead to a corporate tax revenue disaster.

"44yv96","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Why hasn't Elizabeth Warren endorsed Bernie Sanders? Here's one theory. Lets discuss!","The mouthpiece for progressive Democrats before Bernie Sanders’ rise to prominence on the national stage belonged to Elizabeth Warren, the soft-spoken relative newcomer to politics who quickly rose from rejected Consumer Protection Bureau nominee to Senator of Massachusetts. Since her introduction to the national stage, Warren has cultivated a populist presence and spokesperson persona that is both practiced and effective. She appears more confident in her public proclamations than from her first appearance as an interviewee on the Daily Show, but she maintains the appearance of modest integrity and trustworthiness that seems to have eluded Hillary Clinton in terms of public perception. 

How popular has Elizabeth Warren become? It should be noted that she was encouraged to run for President heavily by the left months before Bernie Sanders was a household name. Indeed, if she had elected to run, it’s likely that Bernie Sanders would not be considered the darling among progressives that he is now, for many that support him now would have preferred her. 

What made Warren compelling as a potential candidate was that she personifies the best qualities of both Hillary and Bernie. Bernie’s supporters are attracted to the qualities of transparency, genuine progressive politics, and a populist unforgiving rage against Wall Street for their unpunished part in the national recession. Hillary’s supporters could get behind her feminist beliefs, her belief in a more controlled capitalism as opposed to socialism, and the natural appeal of electing the nation’s first female president. Indeed, only Warren’s opposition to the legalization of marijuana stood between her and younger voters, but it is likely that this single policy could be overlooked by that age group in a way that they simply aren’t willing to overlook Clinton’s flaws.
Nevertheless, Warren refused to run for president, a decision that actually made a lot of sense despite the disappointment it created among her fans. And the reasons for that decision can tell us a lot about why Warren hasn’t made any endorsements this far into the race, even as she makes statements which clearly align her with Sanders’ camp. 

Let’s get out of the way first the probably accurate notion that Warren didn’t feel confident she could beat Clinton. Warren’s most impressive political accomplishment to date is the defeat of a bumbling Scott Brown. Taking down Hillary Clinton requires a crazy kind of confidence; one which can come from a person who would have nothing to lose by entering the race (i.e. Bernie Sanders). The fact is that Elizabeth Warren is trying to make things happen in the Senate, and focusing on what was probably a losing race would detract from those goals.

Secondly, Warren probably just isn’t interested in the office of the presidency. Her political interests are primarily domestic. While she has voiced interest on some foreign policy issues (such as the TPP) her interest in those all goes back to her staunch defense of the American worker. She probably doesn’t feel qualified, indeed probably isn’t qualified, to make military decisions or deal competently with Iran, North Korea, ISIS, or any of the other complex issues on the world scene today. We have already seen Bernie Sanders airy reliance on dovish and hazy policy in the debates to be his major weakness against the international powerhouse that is Hillary Clinton. 

Why this matters is that the same could probably be said of Barrack Obama who as a result of this inexperience has relied heavily on the Pentagon and the intelligence community to write his foreign policy, to the dismay of the progressive members of his party. This problem isn’t unique to him, either. We can go back to a newly elected Kennedy’s own laments that his implicit trust of his military advisors, resulting from his own foreign policy ignorance, resulted in the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion. It was only a more experienced Kennedy less trusting of his military advisors that let cooler heads prevail during the Cuban Missile Crisis some years later.  
This would seem to be a likely reason why someone looking to enact meaningful change at home would not even consider a run for the presidency, and Warren staunchly took the position that she was not seeking it. It could very well be the case that Warren respects Clinton’s expertise on this subject of foreign policy over Sanders, and believes Clinton to be a more ideal world presence. Indeed, the fact that Warren so closely identifies politically with Sanders is the same reason she might not want to endorse him for the presidency. If he shares her strengths, she might also believe he shares her flaws. 
This is of course, total speculation. So, lets move on to something a little more convincing. 

If you could list Warren’s highest priorities, Wall Street reform would be at the top of the list, most likely in its very own class of shit she wants to see done in her time. So, if it is so important to her, why wouldn’t she immediately endorse the only candidate with a meaningful plan to do so? 
Well, Wall Street Reform is her main cause, but it’s not her only cause. She also wants to see action taken on climate change, she would like to see a raise of the minimum wage, she wants Obamacare to continue, she wants women to have access to health care, and she wants standardized testing to be challenged and reformed. She is, in effect, still a liberal and a very pragmatic one at that. Which means that Warren considers the real threat to her goals to be the Republican candidates, all of whom would repeal and fight everything that she cares about, and with the house and senate on their side, would do so very effectively. 

Which means, even if you are more aligned with Sanders than Clinton, you are likely more concerned that a protracted battle for the soul of the Democratic Party will result in the election of one of those boogeymen from the right in a critical election. Especially on the issue of Climate Change, this is a must win election for those who believe in saving the planet from the disasters that come with global warming from those unwilling to take action. And because Warren in particular is such an influential voice in the Democratic Party, she has the power to add to the length of that battle by endorsing Sanders. 
This leaves Warren with an interesting conundrum. She could throw her lot in with Sanders, but doing so would cause more damage to Hillary in the general election by further fracturing the base. And, it would likely be meaningless anyway. Even if it extends the fight (which is again, potentially disastrous to the Democratic Party’s chances in the general election) Hillary is still by far the likely nominee. But she isn’t going to be willing to stump for Hillary in the primary either, not while an opponent like Sanders is in the race, troubled as she is by Clinton’s strong connection with the same people in Wall Street that Warren has been championing against for the entirety of her political career. 

The only sensible course of action therefore is to stick to her populist guns, and try to force Hillary to move to the left by challenging her strongly on the issues where they disagree, and supporting her on the issues where they do agree. In effect, Warren needs to hang the threat that she will endorse Sanders without actually doing it, acting as a unifier for the party while at the same time forcing Hillary to repeat over and over that she is for Wall Street Reform. Which is exactly what Elizabeth Warren has been doing. 
The hope is that Hillary, once she wins the nomination, can find a genuine way to convince the people on the left that she is, in fact, for the things she cares about. That’s a challenging road for Clinton, who struggles to convince people that she means what she says.

 One way to do that of course, would be to select someone as a running mate with strong liberal credentials, someone who has influence in the Senate and among the left, someone who will confirm her support among women, someone who has maintained their integrity in their party, and someone who didn’t back her opponent in a bitterly fought primary that has become increasingly ugly.

I wonder who that could be. Warren has positioned herself to be tapped for this role, and it will be Hillary’s worst move yet if she doesn’t strongly consider it.
