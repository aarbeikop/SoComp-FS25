 To me it seems like, as with other topics such as climate change, animal extinction and lifestyle diseases, we struggle to find a solution, before it's too late.

Questions that comes to mind: What will be our salvation for this food shortage? Will it affect the whole world or just parts, and leave the rest in misery? I am all about the free world, but this crisis is largely due to the rapidly growing population in Asia and Africa. Is it fair we have to the rest of the world, that they act as they do? 

What will be our salvation? World War III, Veganism, a globally reformed agriculture system, synthetic food..?
