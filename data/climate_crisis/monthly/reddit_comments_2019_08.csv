First, enough with the ""follow your passion/achieve your dreams"" stuff. You have any idea how few people end up in their ""dream"" careers that actually turn out to be what they imagine, let alone *have* ""dreams"" in the first place? The overwhelming majority of humans throughout history have had one principal ""dream"":  to have a decent life, perhaps a bit better than their parents. To not be hand-to-mouth poor with a leaky roof and cardboard in their shoes to patch the holes.  

If you can find a job that gives you a reasonably comfortable income and whose work you don't mind doing, you're ahead of most of the people alive *today*. What your job does is give you money to pay for the things you enjoy in your free time.

Second, maybe start putting more faith in what people *do* rather than what they *say*.

"exfm233","t3_cskxnr","cskxnr","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","Because the climate crises “severity” is a made up problem by activists who are trying to gin up concern for their cause. Like all activists they have to highlight a problem so basically, they just make it all up. No one gets excited about this because most reasonable people realize it is all nonsense.

This has been going on for decades now, going back to the 1970’s. However back in the 1970’s it was the opposite. The concern and call for action then was about to prevent a global freeze up.

Now for a bit of a reality check.

* In human history has the climate been warmer than it is now?  Yes. The medieval warm period and the Roman warm period. The climate activists don’t want you to know about that, but it is so.
* In human history has the climate been colder?  Yes, it has. 12,000 years ago, there was a mile or two high glaciers right on top of Boston and all of New England. The seas were 300-400 lower than now and that was big climate change when that baby melted.  In more recent times there was the Little Ice age and we have painted pictures of people skating on rivers in the winter in places that have not seen ice in a long while.. Climate activists don’t want you to know about either of those events.
* Will the climate be different in 10-25-50 years from now? Without a doubt. Will it be warmer or colder? No one knows, including the “experts” who say they do. More often they are wrong than right.
* Additionally, there is centuries, if not millennia, of “experts” who predict things that are totally wrong.  The theories of that “Expert” Malthus, are more recently Ehrilch, were wrong. This list of wrong predictions is a long one.","2019-08-19 19:38:34","-1","Dbgb4","1747929273.832492","climate crisis","manual"

There's already legislation in place in some European countries where they'll start transitioning to all electrice drive vehicles in 5-10 years. I can't divulge my source but one of the funnier issues was, in a country there is legislation that since electric vehicles are quiet, they should be made to emit a sound to alert pedestrians. The idea was they want pedestrians to hear a car coming just like if it was  a gas powered car, with the sound changing as speed increases. So car companies are working on this now, especially those with iconic engine sounds (Subaru Boxer engine for example). Apparently one bus company misunderstood it, and submitted different sounds like bird chips and cow bells. Think about it. A bus coming your way and it sounds like a fucking cow bell. Obviously they had a good laugh.

1. There are no designs for Thorium-based or fusion reactors.   
Thorium is used in some research reactors, but there are no production reactor designs using it. Fusion is worse, requiring more power to work than it makes.

2. ZEVs by 2030 will kill the automotive industry and cause wide-spread blackouts.   
Yes, the technology exists, but nobody wants EVs except hipsters who care more about looking like they care about the Earth than actually caring about the Earth. EVs use highly toxic materials that require large amounts of energy to mine and are mined in shithole countries. The higher energy use will tax and break the grid.  


A more sensible plan would be:

1. Push for nuclear now and streamline the legal process to get the plants built. Build them in the middle of nowhere instead of in major cities and upgrade the grid to get the power out. Require they be designed for a mass-produced, standardized, reactor that can be upgraded to a drop-in replacement with Thorium-based reactors.
2. Push for diesel-electric buses (same technology as current diesel-electric locomotives) and hydrogen peroxide-based urban vehicles (akin to kei cars and city cars).
3. Fix CAFE to simply separate vehicle classes by GVWR, instead of the light truck bullshit that has been going around for decades.","2019-08-30 17:28:46","4","elsydeon666","1747929568.126865","climate crisis","manual"

This Vox article has a map of [regions with water issues](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8790939/map-heres-where-the-world-is-running-out-of-groundwater).

In the past there have been issues with over pumping of water for bottling and such. This was largely a regulation issue though where water rights aren't properly handled. This is especially true near the Great Lakes and specifically Michigan.

As mentioned we can use energy to do desalination if it becomes a huge issue. Research into desalination [still has a lot of paths](https://phys.org/news/2019-06-hot-efficiency-solar-desalination.html).","2019-08-12 04:15:58","2","Sirisian","1747929896.1841972","climate crisis","manual"
"ewp6rfg","t3_cp4y70","cp4y70","futurology","unknown","Climate change is not a threat to the rich.  In fact they probably figure they'll make money from it.  Maybe a few hundred million poor people will die in the tropics.  Nothing will be done about it that doesn't bring a fat profit to the psychopaths who rule over us.  Think of it as the genocide of the Iraq war multiplied by 100 to 5000.

Climate change will (probably) not lead to human extinction, but if it does it will be because of a total collapse of the food web with over 99% of species dying including everything humans eat and so on.  That's an unprecedented failure far worse than previous mass extinctions but it's not impossible.  The rich have already committed humanity to a gamble that this worst case scenario does not happen.  That's done.  They really need to prevent the Insect Apocalypse.  I expect some action on that.

Having said that humanity will probably go extinct from some other completely unrelated and perhaps unforseen event in the next few thousand years.

I didn't mean to down play climate change.  It will be a completely unprecedented degree of human suffering worse then (maybe) dozens of world war twos.

"evu3gzx","t3_cl68ic","cl68ic","futurology","unknown","Trees are good, hemp is better. Trees have a higher biomass per acre, but in the 50 years that trees need to achieve that biomass, you could plant and harvest 50 crops of hemp, leading to much higher carbon update. Plus, the hemp can go into making paper, fabrics, and even construction materials such as support beams (thereby locking the carbon away for the life of the building it goes into).

Even better than trees and hemp, is the seeding of the oceans with iron and other nutrients. Plankton are the foundation of the food chain, and produce 70% of the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. Get *that* to grow like crazy, and we’ll have not only less CO2, but also a healthier and more vibrant ocean. Right now whales and fish are starving *en masse* because of the knock-down effects of global warming, which directly impact plankton growth. Give them every incentive to grow, and they will.","2019-08-02 22:25:21","2","ThrowAway640KB","1747929936.964318","climate crisis","manual"
"evtexdq","t3_cl68ic","cl68ic","futurology","unknown","You are not wrong, but there is a question of who is going to pay for them, and where is that money going to come from.

It seems *obvious* to me that the wealthy economies in the world should pay for the trees (since we're the ones producing most of the CO2), and the way to do that is a significant carbon tax.  However, there are political groups (i.e. Republicans, and especially their leader, Trump) that not only won't do the taxes required, absolutely refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem at all.  (I originally wrote that they do not 'believe' there is a problem, but that's not clear;  they very well may actually believe that there is a problem, but refuse to acknowledge it).  

In turn, the politicians will not acknowledge the problem because they are beholden to corporate interests (who provide them money) and the people that voted for them (who, in turn, are informed by a certain segment of the media, i.e. Fox news, that tells them it does not exist, because they are also beholden to corporate interests).  

The whole situation sucks, and I don't know how to get out of it.  I've resigned myself to the idea that we're screwed, and I'm trying to minimize the personal effects on me and those close to me, as society gets worse and worse and the environment gets worse and worse.","2019-08-02 18:02:12","1","beezlebub33","1747929936.96629","climate crisis","manual"
