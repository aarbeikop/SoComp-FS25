"6awhkt","Conservative","unknown","SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: May 14, 2017 Edition","Controversy Over Comey Dismissal

This week President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Democrats who previously had called for Comey's departure denounced the move.

Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn), Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), contends that ""it has thrown the nation into a real constitutional crisis. Here we have a man who should never have been allowed to be president act as if he is the president. Since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote it seems to me that any changes in the personnel in the Executive Branch ought to be approved by her before they are made.""

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) agreed. ""When a person who should not be president usurps the authority of the office that is grounds for impeachment,"" she argued. ""Hillary Clinton should be the one to determine whether Comey deserved to be fired. Considering how he betrayed her during the campaign she would be justified in firing him. I could support that. The Trump Administration's complaint that Comey was doing a terrible job, over-stepping his authority, and impeding the investigation of leaks of classified information are illegitimate because they originate from an illegitimate president.""

Waters dismissed evidence that Comey sat on 600 million pages documenting the Obama Administration's massive illegal surveillance operation targeting American citizens as ""irrelevant. The fact is that if President Obama approved this surveillance its revelation by a whistle blower is treason, pure and simple. The FBI Director has no obligation not to impede an investigation that would impugn our last legitimate president's actions to protect this country from its domestic enemies.""

Following Comey's dismissal the New York Times published leaks from anonymous sources said to be Comey's ""associates at the Bureau."" The leaks reportedly gave details of a private, in-person, one-on-one conversation between Comey and President Trump. The leakers' allegation that Trump asked for Comey's loyalty is unverified. However, the very existence of this ""leak"" does seem to validate the premise that despite his denials that he has never leaked anything to the media nor authorized any of his subordinates to do so, Comey either is the source of this leak or that the leak is totally fabricated.

Michelle Obama Assails School Lunch Deregulation

Former First Lady Michelle Obama, the instigator of rules that led to massive trashing of school lunches across America, expressed her dismay at the Trump Administration's decision to allow local school authorities to select their own menus. ""What is wrong with these people?"" she wanted to know. ""The menus crafted under my guidance were carefully balanced for the right combinations of nutritious food.""

Trump Administration Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the move, saying that ""requiring schools to set out food that students won't eat accomplishes nothing. Rather than force everyone to conform to a standard that leads to waste we are allowing local people who likely have a better idea of what their students will eat the latitude to make their own decisions.""

Michelle labeled Perdue's reasoning ""ignorant"" and ""a recipe for sickness and death. It shifts power from the recognized experts to local yahoos too weak to take on the task of altering the food prejudices of the masses. This 'laissez faire' attitude reverses the gains made during my husband's administration. And for what? Is the freedom to poison one's body with an unhealthful diet now some sort of inalienable right? I think most parents and voters will see it as a criminal attack on the health of our young people that clearly fits within the 'high crimes and misdemeanors' grounds for impeachment.""

Muslim Persecution in US Worse than ISIS Massacre of Christians

This week, ABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd challenged evangelist Franklin Graham's concerns about the persecution of Christians around the globe, calling it ""overblown. A far worse problem is the persecution of Muslims right here in the United States.""

While the practice of Christianity is illegal in some Muslim countries and severely hampered in others, Muslims in the US openly attend mosques and pray in public without any officially sanctioned interference and little unofficial notice or impediments. While Muslim fanatics readily heed the Quran's call to slaughter unbelievers who refuse to convert, there is no similar scriptural call for Christians to kill members of other faiths and Muslims are free to move about without being blown apart, shot, or beheaded by Christian zealots.

To Dowd, though, the absence of contemporary atrocities by Christians is ""historically myopic. Let's not forget that a thousand years ago popes called upon Christians to take back lands conquered by Muslims in that religion's great era of expansion. As former President Obama pointed out, plenty of Muslims died at the hands of pious Christians during these 'Crusades.'""

""The insidious signs of Muslim persecution in the US are evinced by the disapproving stares of Americans who disrespect their traditional garb, the extra scrutiny they get for merely repeating the words of their holy book, and the suspicion that their beliefs justifying jihad are dangerous and 'unAmerican,'"" Dowd maintained. ""Being forced to endure an atmosphere of continual dread is crueler than a quick thrust of a beheader's knife. So, yes, the horrors inflicted on Muslims in our country are worse than whatever has happened to Christians intruding on Muslim lands.""

Trump Gets Preferential Treatment in White House Dining Room

Appalling repression in the White House dining room came to light when the media exposed the scandalous story of how President Trump gets more and better food than other diners. In a Time magazine article it was revealed that at White House dinners Trump gets Diet Coke (everyone else gets water), Trump gets Thousand Island dressing (everyone else gets vinaigrette), Trump gets two scoops of ice cream (everyone else gets one).

CNN's Jeanne Moos saw this as ""unjustifiable discrimination—the kind that makes you wonder whether Trump thinks he's king."" In support of this theory, Moos cited the fact that ""Vice-President Pence doesn't get any ice cream. He's only allowed a 'fruit plate.' What has he done to get on Trump's bad side?""

Cristeta Comerford, the White House Executive Chef since 2005, denied there was any discrimination: ""anyone who asks is given the same option to choose as the President. You want something other than water? Just ask. You want a different salad dressing? We have many from which you can choose. You want two scoops of ice cream, three scoops, whatever? Just ask.""

Moos contended that ""the chef's response is too convenient to be credible. We need to know who pressured her to come up with this unbelievable alibi. Was she cowed into submission by the very public firing of the FBI Director? Or was her subservient status as a woman of color within a racist administration sufficient to extract the desired cover story? This incident would seem to bolster calls for an independent prosecutor to investigate Trump.""

Female Refugees Victims of Sexual Violence in Germany

A study by the news service Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) found that female refugees living in government shelters are being repeatedly harassed and attacked by male guards and refugees. Sally Abazeed, a 20-year-old refugee from Syria, told of how she had been repeatedly accosted by a guard at the shelter. She also said she was often followed into the toilets at night by one of the guards.

Abazeed escaped from the shelter with the assistance of a fellow Syrian only to be raped by him once outside the compound. She reported the rape to the police, but was told she had insufficient evidence to justify an investigation.

Berlin Police Department spokesman Helmut Banger explained that ""our accommodation of sharia law requires that all rape allegations must be supported by either two male eyewitnesses or four female eyewitnesses. Unfortunately, Ms Abazeed could produce no witnesses. We had no alternative. We had to dismiss her case.""

More Abortions Needed to Fight Global Warming

Feminist icon Gloria Steinem made an impassioned plea for preserving and extending women's right to abortion, calling it ""a powerful and necessary remedy in the fight against sexual injustice and global warming. Nothing is worse for the planet than more people. Interdicting the creation of more people is crucial if we are to avert a holocaust.""

As Steinem sees it, men force women into bearing children. ""Considering the toll it takes on a woman's body, no woman in her right mind would willingly submit to childbirth,"" she contended. ""Add to this the tremendous sacrifice of free time that must be given up in order to care for children. Agreeing to have a child is akin to selling yourself into slavery. The men who pressure women into this tragic fate must be stopped.""

""Essential to stopping this pattern of patriarchal tyranny is abortion,"" Steinem asserted. ""A lot of people don't know this, but the Nazis paid women to have children. Thankfully, we haven't descended to that level of disrespect for humanity because we still allow abortion. As long as women have an unconstrained right to terminate any pregnancy they will hold the key that unlocks their chains. As an added bonus, the removal of millions and potentially billions of unwanted humans using this right is what will save the Earth from environmental catastrophe.""

Newspaper Calls for Stricter Censorship

Citing the ""need to protect the more sensitive among us from the psychological damage of words that could be construed as offensive,"" the editors of the Washington Post urged that ""we unwed ourselves from the notion that freedom of speech is a vital or even necessary feature of a civilized society.""

""The right of freedom of speech does not have a meaningful quantum of value to the average person,"" the editors wrote. ""The average person continually must refrain from saying things that would offend an employer, spouse, or friend in order to interact harmoniously with the people closest to him. Why shouldn't the government step in and enforce this same behavior as a general improvement of society?""

""There's an old saying 'that if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.'"" the editorial continued. ""If everyone knew that insensitive utterances could result in substantial financial penalties or even jail time, it stands to reason that conversations would become more pleasant. Fewer feelings would be hurt. Fewer people would have cause to strike out at those who offend them. People would be happier.""

In related news, Edgewood Middle School in Trenton, Ohio gave seventh grader Zachary Bowlin a 10 day suspension for ""liking"" a photo of of an airsoft pellet gun on Instagram. Edgewood Schools Superintendent Russ Fussnecker explained that ""we have a 'zero tolerance' of inappropriate behavior by any of our students. The fact that Zachary publicly expressed his like for this dangerous weapon showed a grave insensitivity to his fellow students and manifested an intent to intimidate his classmates. The contention that the weapon is non-lethal, that the offense occurred outside of school grounds and hours does not excuse the behavior. We are going to stamp out incorrigible attitudes with as harsh a punishment as we can impose. Those who refuse to get the message will be crushed.""

"6bhimq","vegan","unknown","It's not ""Cause Cow farts"", its Because of the Massive Open Fields of Methane Releasing Excrement -- Thank You!","I see the top post in r/Vegan today is a photo of a livestock factory, and its a picture of animal living space vs. cesspool of waste. Of course this is sad for the animals. But the animals happiness is not as alarming as what this really represents, an open field of methane releasing excrement delivering the single most climate modifying greenhouse gas humans produce.


There are lots of things that make me angrier and angrier at humans (esp. Americans with whom I have the most experience) everyday about being Vegan and the greatest is the petulant redicule regarding the topic of ""Cow farts"". 


It seems like I can't even discuss the topic of methane waste product from livestock farming with anyone who isn't an environmental scientist without them laughing and making fart jokes.


Great. Super fun. But if this top photo is anything it's an illustration that it's not flatulence that releases the methane it's concentrated excrement that lays in open fields like in this picture. Just sitting there releasing methane, slowly trapping the suns rays and increasing our planet's greenhouse effect in ways it hasn't experienced in millions of years.


Go ahead and laugh, ha ha. While we're all on the verge of dying from ecological collapse, livestock farmers are irresponsibly changing the planets climate and disrupting the balance that affords humanity the pleasure of existence all for the luxury of human meat consumption.


Pre-industrialized animal production saw cows in fields, sure it was still mean and cruel for the animals, but at least they were in fields, and the excrement was spread around and given a chance to be useful as fertilizer and plants grew over it, reducing its albedo and allowing green things to rise from it in the form of plants. A pretty neat system actually. In a factory farm, these dark places heat up under the sun and as much methane as possibly imaginable is released into the atmosphere. It's not cool. It's really not fucking cool.


Are there any environmental scientists in r/vegan? Maybe this should be an AMA request, but right now it's just a rant because I'm sick of all the babies of the world laughing at the topic of cow farts and completely missing the valid points. 


* Cow excrement is not simply free fertilizer for plants at this scale.


* Methane released from animal farming isn't direct from the animal but more from the fields of excrement.


* This is just not cool, or funny, life on Earth *will* die, while people are making fart jokes instead of addressing the very real concerns of atmospheric methane contamination.","2017-05-16 13:39:35","140","36","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/6bhimq/its_not_cause_cow_farts_its_because_of_the/","True","TheNumberOfTheBeast","1747885596.679661","our planet is dying","manual"

1. Two friends just went vegetarian and possibly will go vegan this week and I am STOKED. I have read a lot but I want to know your recommendations for the best book to recommend to them first. I am looking for something easy to read, which probably goes into both the ethics, nutrition, and general information. I want to hook, line, and sinker these two friends since they watched the documentaries and are inspired at the moment :)

2. Where is the best place to start learning more about the issues with non-Vegan products outside of the food realm? I have been Vegan for over a  year now but I know very little about testing on animals, Vegan clothing (I just know to avoid leather), etc. I also know very little about how Veganism ties into the environmental issues beyond the basic concept that factory farming is harming our planet.  Thank you in advance <3

Am finally reading Eating Animals atm, but my books so far have mostly been things like How Not to Die, the Lean, Vegan Freak, Starch Solution, Eat for Health, etc. that don't really go into any of that stuff much.","2017-05-25 20:15:22","2","4","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/6dc6a3/two_questions_recommend_resources/","True","sarradarling","1747885678.3510568","our planet is dying","manual"

“If I had opened this restaurant and failed miserably, that would have been cool,” said Trevor Sullivan, looking out over the glistening Winooski River in Burlington, Vermont. “Not from an ego standpoint, but because I have this knowledge I really believe to be true, and I have to share it.” He took a long draw from his Lawson’s beer, exposing the underside of his sleeved tattoo, a black and white lotus flower ingrained on his elbow. “Just like the guy standing out in New York with a praise jesus sign. He really believes that, and he's doing it. We need more of that passion, and more of that coming from a positive place.” 
For many herbivores, animal rights aren’t the only motivation for adopting a plant based diet. Swaths of scientific journals, health publications and climate change research over the last 5 years has drastically expanded, elucidating the profound effects the human diet has on the environment, and our own health. If this is the case, why do Americans still consume so much meat?
Tucked into the front corner of an old cotton mill, perched only twenty feet away from the river’s edge, sits Trevor’s newly refurbished plant based cafe, Pingala. Four wide windows open the small, one roomed restaurant to the spring’s bright afternoon glow. Old mason jars line the window sills, blooming with freshly picked purple tulips, and miniature terrariums hang down from the ceiling bobbing in the breeze. A warm, sugary sweet smell of scones drafts from the kitchen, reaching our noses on the patio just outside the quaint eatery.
Trevor ran his fingers through his closely trimmed beard. Behind thin, metal wrapped glasses, sat his sharp green eyes, inquisitive and kind. He had fluid, dark brown hair that curled upwards like a breaking wave, falling neatly atop itself. He said, “I wanted to create a place where I felt good eating, but also a place for people who didn't necessarily share the same views as me, felt good eating too.” 
The key to Pingala’s success is its integrity. Instead of catering to the meat, cheese and egg consuming customers, the cafe provides over 30 plant powered options ranging from fresh pressed juices, to vibrant veggie-loaded sandwiches. Sure, the cafe could make a few extra bucks by adding animal products to the menu, but the idea is that if they do it well enough, the vegan cafe can prove to customers that alternative substitutes to popular animal products can be just as delicious, nourishing and sustainable. “The ultimate goal would be to turn as many people on to vegan food as we can, through the food, the atmosphere and the service, not through pushing our values on anybody.” He laughed and hesitated before saying, “It sounds cliché, but let the food speak for itself.”
	More recently the word “vegan” tends to come with a negative connotation. The vegan stereotype often looks like a radical food activist, standing morally superior to those who eat meat. Certainly there are radical vegans out there, but Trevor proffers that at the heart of this lifestyle, it’s all about loving the earth, the animals and our bodies. What’s equally important, he mentioned, was respecting and understanding the people that might not be ready to open up to this change. 


What the health?
Right now, 78 million Americans suffer from obesity, 29 million have diabetes and 610,000 (1 in 4 Americans) die from heart disease each year (Heart Disease, 2015). Even though America has developed some of the most technologically advanced medical practices and spent more than double the amount of any other country on healthcare, the U.S is still the “heaviest” country in the world, with a life expectancy lower than 40 other nations (Life Expectancy, 2015). Over the last 30 years, due largely in part to governmental food subsidies and misleading national dietary suggestions, Americans have been given access to cheaper, faster, less healthy and easier-to-eat foods. The nation’s health has plummeted and the rate of preventable, diet related illness has skyrocketed. Animal products, the worst being red meat, processed meats and high-fat dairy products, are significantly responsible for diabetes, obesity and heart disease. Experts suggest that “animal fat, animal-based iron, and nitrate preservatives in meat have been found to damage pancreatic cells, worsen inflammation, cause weight gain, and impair the way our insulin functions” (Barnard, 2014). 
Cow’s milk, a staple in America’s diet for decades, was made popular by U.S. Dietary guidelines and tactful marketing. These guidelines suggest consuming three servings of dairy a day for its protein and calcium. Yet, some scientists argue that “milk can actually cause bones to lose calcium, and their effects could have a direct link to osteoporosis” (Klein, 2014). This happens because, like all animal protein, milk acidifies body pH levels, triggering a biological correction. Calcium is an excellent acid neutralizer and our bones, which are a rich calcium bank, need it to stay strong. But the same calcium needed to make strong bones is utilized to neutralize the acidifying effect of milk. Once the calcium is pulled out of the bones, it exits the body via the urine, resulting in calcium loss. In fact, a 28 year study found that “osteoporotic bone fracture rates are highest in countries that consume the most dairy, calcium, and animal protein, and most studies of fracture risk provide little or no evidence that milk or other dairy products benefit human bones” (Lanou, 2009).
Additionally, humans are the only mammalian species that continue to drink milk after infanthood, and certainly the only species that consumes other species’ infant growth fluid (milk). Cow’s specialized concoction packs three times the protein as human milk and is capable of nursing a newborn calf to nearly 800 pounds by the time it’s weaned. 
Around 7,000 years ago, the once lactose-intolerant human diet adapted to consume dairy for its high nutritional value. Though we’ve created many alternative dairy substitutes, cow’s milk still remains a crucial part of most American’s lifelong diets. “You have to trace the idea of eating meat and dairy back thousands of years, to when we were concerned about surviving, versus living like we do now,” Trevor said, slicking back his hair. He finished off his beer and shook the empty can before placing it back on the table. “Now, most of us can live our whole lives without going into that survival mode.” 

Bigger isn’t always better…
With a growing worldwide population estimated to reach 9 billion by 2050, our food production is planned to double in order to feed the extra 2 billion mouths. Though this consensus is agreed upon, many experts have differing ideas of how it should be handled. 
Why is eating meat bad for the environment? Animal agriculture emits more greenhouse gas than the entire transportation sector combined, which is “largely from methane released by cattle and rice farms, nitrous oxide from fertilized fields, and carbon dioxide from the cutting of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock” (Foley, Feeding 9 billion). In agreeance, studies published by Worldwatch Institute suggest that animal agriculture is responsible for “at least 51% of annual worldwide GHG emissions” (Worldwatch, 2011). The harm isn’t only in the atmosphere, but also the millions of hectares of land it covers. Pastured land for livestock accounts for a third of all earth’s land (Owen, 2005), and is responsible for 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest (Worldwatch, 2011). The farmland created, destroys valuable carbon sequestering forests, which when cut down, not only eliminate the species within them, but also releases the harmful pollutants back into the air. 
I sat next to Mark Budolfson, an assistant Professor at the University of Vermont (UVM). On either side of his two vertically facing computer monitors, sat large stacks of books, some titled “Ethics of Eating,” “The Environment and food” and “Food Ethics and Society,” the latter he recently published with two other philosophy professors at UVM. 
We stared at his two screens analyzing a colorful and meticulously crafted data sheet. “The graph quantifies the impacts that popular foods have across different dimensions we care about” he said. The categories include land and water intensity, carbon and greenhouse gas emission levels, and the quality of treatment of the animals and workers in the industry. Foods highlighted in red identified products less sustainable than others, such as apples, which stood out  due to their high demand for water, while most meats were highlighted in red for their harmful pollutants. “It’s extremely hard to quantify all of the variables,” Budolfson said, resting his chin on his tightly clenched fist. “Many numbers calculated by vegan advocacy groups don’t always consider all of the factors.” The main correction Budolfson’s graph acknowledges is the amount of proteins and calories produced per kilogram of food, which distorts numbers against animal products. He breaks these numbers down and utilizes the best peer reviewed scientific publications, as well as his best, unbiased judgement to create transparent and accurate data. “Even then, it's still true that beef is arguably worse on all levels than anything else,” he said, “the best diet for minimizing your harmful footprint is vegan.”  
A differing view comes from Meredith Niles, an assistant Professor at UVM and food systems sustainability researcher. She believes that ""animals play a vital role in food production systems, particularly since they are not only a food source but also provide vital nutrient inputs for crop production."" 
In her office, an empty wine bottle stood like a trophy on her desk, a memento from her fruitful research on a New Zealand (NZ) farm that integrated sheep herds into grape vineyards. Her walls were covered in hand drawn diagrams written with dry erase markers, each illustration was carefully drawn, outlining the positive feedback loops associated with agricultural practices in New Zealand. “I’m very much a visual learner,” she laughed, spinning in her chair admiring her work. Much of her ‘on the ground’ organic research stemmed from a rich academic career at Harvard University and the University of California-Davis. Some of her most impactful work has been with farmers, collecting their consensus on climate change. Her research found roughly 70% of the island’s local farmers agree that climate change is occurring and their practices are negatively affected by it. 

Farmers experience climate change more than most professions, and weather can be a dictating variable for a profitable year. Though farmers acknowledge the negative effects of animal agriculture on their own profession, they are reluctant to give it up. After the government attempted to set a carbon tax on all harmful pollutants in 2003, farmer lobbyists fought hard to exclude non-CO2 gasses from their emissions tax. This allowed farmers to raise the same or greater amounts of cattle with virtually no consequences. 
Niles’ profound compassion for farmers and environmental concern was clear. Differing from Budolfson’s ideas of mitigating climate change, Niles thinks that efforts to curb consumption of animal products “must consider the fact that nearly one billion people rely on animal agriculture for their livelihoods, particularly across low-income countries."" Though there are many families that don’t have a distinct choice over the foods they consume, there are also many people that do. These consumer choices, on a grand scale, ultimately dictate how America’s food systems run.  

It’s not that simple
For those that do have the choice to substitute meat and dairy for potentially healthier and less harmful options, why don’t they switch? This depends on a vast array of reasons, though six major motives stand out. 
First, as we can see from the high rates of obesity in America, changing dietary habits, even when it directly affects personal health, is extremely hard. Food deserts, vapid of fresh produce and healthier options, burden many impoverished areas, especially in the south.
Second, governmental food subsidies supporting the meat industry lower the rate of meat prices substantially. This makes it more accessible for lower income communities to consume high protein diets. 
Third, directly related to governmental subsidies, fast food restaurants like Mcdonald's and countless other chain restaurants have created quick and easy ways to satisfy hunger, while also helping families save money. This provides a convenient meal for busy, low income families, especially prevalent in the south.
Fourth, it’s right in our faces. On commercials, in almost every restaurant and supermarket, and delivered to our doors. The powerful animal agriculture industry want their customers to keep consuming animal products so they can continue to profit, regardless of its complications. 
Fifth, the facts and information around healthier diets isn’t always easily accessible to the general public, and the alternative food choices we can make aren’t advertised like other food products are. Additionally, for decades, the general public has been led by the National Dietary and USDA Guidelines to believe that meat, dairy and eggs are an essential part of our diets for protein and other necessary nutrients. This has perpetuated the stigma that meat is the best way to nourish our bodies.
Finally, humans have been eating meat for thousands of years. It has become culturally ingrained in our daily lives and is apart of many major American holidays. Think about Thanksgiving and Christmas, where millions of turkeys are cooked and pigs are roasted on one dedicated day. Old habits are hard to kick, especially when they taste good, fill our stomachs and are celebrated in our cultural events. 
For all of these complex reasons and more, it’s hard to introduce a different diet to America, even if it has been proven to be equally as fulfilling, healthier and more environmentally friendly. Plus, having to sacrifice one's love of meat, cheese and ice cream is a big hurdle in itself. 
As a student majoring in environmental studies, the more I learned about the negative impacts of animal agriculture, the more I realized I couldn’t justify eating the animals I claimed to love, and harm the planet I called home. 
A year ago, I decided to give up meat, and soon after that, all animal products as I learned more about the health benefits and animal rights issues. To me, eating plant based foods has become more than just a diet, but a lifestyle focused around mindfulness, appreciation, health and empowerment. From this I’ve learned three important things. One, as a poor college student, it is possible to live a vegan lifestyle without spending extra money. Two, as a highly active individual, I’ve never worried about malnutrition since switching my diet. Finally, instead of inhibiting my diet, it’s broadened my palate and encouraged me to explore new and exciting foods, which I otherwise would have never tried.  
 
What can we do?
Looking into the near future, Mark Budolfson concluded by saying “if we don't begin to use higher yielding methods, we’ll have to use more land, and the worst thing environmentally, is to deforest more land for agriculture.” Though Budolfson and Meredith Niles have differing opinions about America’s animal agricultural practices, her ideas for solving these issues were similar. She suggests that “there are clear environmental and economic benefits for integrating crop and animal systems together” to foster symbiotic relationships and save space. Whatever happens in the near future, the world is certain to see a shift in the way the climate functions and our food systems operate. As for our diets, we may have to start eating more plants. 
Trevor’s warm face glowed in the setting sun. He stood up and made his way towards the red brick walls that house his small cafe. As he approached the building, he said, “Once you open the door of veganism there's just so much,” he grabbed the handle and stepped into Pingala before turning back to me, “but you have to open that door yourself.”

Ladies and gentlemen, space enthusiasts and good people of Reddit. If you would permit me, I would like to engage your brains, and your eyes, for a few moments. 

This is my current complete collection of images of space anomalies. To the best of my knowledge, all of these pictures originally were released by NASA or JPL, with the exception of a few low res photos taken by the soviet lunar probe from the 1970's, and a photo of the earth pyramid in Bosnia that doesn't really belong in the folder but I'm going to leave anyway.

https://imgur.com/a/mg2xI

**What do these images show?**

These are photos of objects and structures that indicate intelligent design. Most of them appear to be ancient and in ruin. The vast majority of the images are from Mars, from the Opportunity and no longer functioning Spirit rovers, as well as the Mars global surveyor orbital satellite. Of the remaining images, most are from Earth's moon, some from comet 67-p, one of an object on Eros, one of Buzz Aldrin's 'monolith' on Phobos, two of the surface of Venus, and two objects captured by the ISS feed that look like craft (terrestrial craft, to my eyes - most likely classified and made by skunkworks. No need to assume aliens! Included because NASA refuses to comment on them). With or without official confirmation, it is entirely up to the viewer to decide if the images are artificial or natural, though in my experience even the most buttoned down of believers in the idea that we are alone and that no evidence from exploration of our system exists to suggest otherwise are at a loss to explain some of the things in the images presented here.

**Do these photos prove the existence of aliens?**

It would be a mistake to assume so. The simplest, most logical explanation is that in the distant past, humans had reached a level of technological development sufficient to colonize the solar system before being nearly wiped out, most likely by the same event that decimated Mars and left it a desert planet where once had been oceans. There are many natural and man made disasters that could wipe out our civilization and send the survivors back to the Stone Age, some of which we couldn't have imagined a generation or two ago. It is quite possible, judging from these photos, that the human race originated from Mars instead of Earth.

**Do these photos belong in r/space?**

Absolutely. All of these photos originate from official sources, any that are discovered to be hoaxes I will remove. Many reference the official source #, though some do not.

**Are these photos enhanced?**

Some are. Most are magnified from the original source. Whenever possible, I have included multiple image views of the same object for comparison's sake. 

**""Enhanced"" means the images have been monkeyed with to make it seem like something instead of nothing.**

It can mean that. For comparison I offer a 'pareidolia' if you will, of a sculpture in front of a cliff face. When I look at it I see a badly eroded figure of a human female with a baby at breast.  (https://i.imgur.com/LywlLZD.jpg) In the enhancement, I still see an ancient statue of a woman with babe at breast, but the picture has been cleaned up a bit. A different 'enhancement' from an overly enthusiastic online UFO rag reveals a painted scene of a buff blond Martian dude with the 'baby' morphed into a green lizard bursting out of his stomach(https://i.imgur.com/ycb3CUZ.jpg). The picture makes a good contrast to the other, so I left it in.

**What about the pareidolia argument? Aren't you just seeing what you want to see?**

Pareidolia doesn't apply to geometry. Geometrical forms in images can easily be measured and confirmed. For the most part, the pareidolia argument was used against faces, starting with the original cydonia face imaged by the Viking orbiter in the 1970's. The weight of argument for artificial constructs lies with the many instances of circles, squares, rectangles, spheres, cubes (boxes), isosceles and equilateral triangles, pyramids, tetrahedrons and other geometric forms. The number of perfectly aligned 90 degree angles forming vertices to be found from the rover photos alone is enough to make case for artificiality.

**Are there photos of faces or figures here?**

Yes. When I first began collecting images of anomalies, I deliberately avoided pictures of faces or of humanoid figures, focusing instead on geometry. Over time, however, the weight of compelling examples of faces or figures that were clear and in focus led me to decide that it would be a disservice not to include them. I draw no conclusions and make no claims about what these actually are.

**Are you affiliated with the Mars Moon Space web group?**

No, though I do follow them on Facebook. You will find some of their images here.

**Where did you get these images?**

Most from Facebook groups, some from websites found via google image searches for ""Mars anomalies"", etc. In some cases I tracked down and cropped the image personally from the original NASA pics. A few others were taken directly from NASA sites as well.

**These are just photos of rocks!**

Yeah. Mostly. For an image to be included it had to have something interesting, but it could just be a rock with a 90 degree angle in a field of other ordinary looking rocks. If I had a talent for visual interpretation I might be working for a defence contractor analyzing satellite data. I don't, something has to show up clearly for my untrained eye to see it.

**How many images are there in the collection?**

Over 1200 and counting, with more being added as I get them. I know there are doubles, but it would be too much work to sort through and delete them. The best ones should still catch the eye and appear artificial with a rapid scan of the thumbnails. At some point I may whittle them down to the 100 or so best ones and repost.

**What do some of the most compelling ones show?**

Buildings, most looking like ancient ruins or foundations, some looking modern and intact.  Various pieces of decaying machinery, at least 3 small boat hulls, at least 3 rectangular 'cave' doorways cut into mountainsides, a wire brush, a handgun, cannon turrets and artillery pieces, military style helmets, tanks, symbols and letters etched into rock (the letter z appears multiple times), two examples of threaded machined screws, boxes crumbling as well as relatively intact, a metal finger ring with a setting for a stone, an object that looks like a toilet seat, another that resembles a birdhouse, two examples of an ornate sarcophagus, vehicles, plants, animal corpses, bones and footprints, water both running and stagnant, stairs, a spoon, an Egyptian ankh or Celtic cross, 3 Christian style crosses, numerous stone and glass spheres of various sizes, metal tubes and pipes, a shoe, artistic rock carvings of various subjects, many more broken bits and pieces of things whose function is unclear. The number 58 appears to show up in satellite photos of both Mars and our moon. If I had to pick a single image to make the argument for artificiality, it would be the orbital photo of the circular building with window bays jutting out from the top of a cliffside that closely resembles the Jupiter II spacecraft from the old Lost in Space TV series (https://i.imgur.com/CtCCMXj.png  being circular, it often gets referred to as a ""crashed UFO""). From the rover it would be the large instillation in the distance laid out in a distinct 90 degree angle at the foot of Mt.Sharp (https://i.imgur.com/kqbuXkS.jpg). Multiple images of both anomalies are included, adjusting the colour and contrast can really bring out the outlines of faraway buildings and is used often.

**Why are you posting this?**

I want answers. I want to know everything I can about this lost civilization. Even if the people who built these things were not human, the overwhelming evidence indicates we were and are more alike than unalike. Their history is our history. I think it's time for the human race to grow up and face the truth about itself, whatever it may be, and start dealing with it. Considering the amount that this knowledge could disrupt all of human culture, it's not surprising that the US government is remaining silent. Consider for a moment the effect of finding a vast archive of knowledge recovered from an ancestral space faring civilization and releasing it to the public would be. It would change everything, but I think it worth the potential risk. This is reclaiming our own heritage, and even if the majority of Earth's people were to focus on learning about the extraterrestrial cultures of the ancient past (or present), interest in preserving our own terrestrial culture and history will never die out, as long as our civilization continues.

Only a few of these images have become well known and are generating interest online, hence this post. There are new ones being found every day, the curiosity rover is still working at this time. It is my hope that the best of these get widely distributed in the interest of creating serious debate among scientists and laypersons without accusations of being mentally deficient or sniggering comments regarding tinfoil hats and anal probes, etc.

Thank you for your time, and thanks in advance to the mods of r/space for not deleting this post (posted on Sunday in accordance with the rules). I understand the cognitive dissonance and stress to the brain that these images can cause to humans regardless of one's personal beliefs. However this is the twenty-first century, is it not? Science fiction has been a popular genre in entertainment for over a century now, we should be able to get over any conflict with our primitive pre-spacefaring notions and start boldly going forward. If we refuse to confront the discoveries we find out there and the implications they have for humanity, we might as well believe that the earth is both flat and the entire universe, cease exploration altogether and just stay away from the edge.

EDIT: as expected, the mods at r/space had the post removed within half an hour. No message or explanation. Sigh.
