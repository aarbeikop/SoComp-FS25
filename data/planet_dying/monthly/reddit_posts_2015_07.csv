The Rapture wasn't necessarily all of the Christians being taken sporadically off of the planet, but where they were born in History? For instance.. after Christianity dies away along with all other common-day beliefs, all Christians will be gone. As time passes away we destroy ourselves and create our own Hell by the things we currently do today all over the planet. What if The Mark Of The Beast was actually just accepting today's society as the standard?


Anti-Theists: Most Atheists understand Science, and how it is used. With that being said, how does Science prove to you that there is no God?

I apologize for the title.  The second question is directed towards Anti-Theists, not Atheists.

"3f7v00","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I'm not justified in my sadness, and that's pretty fucking sad - On Biological Immortality (long)","The depression I sometimes feel stems from my own mortality.  I understand death and I'd rather not participate in it.

Obviously, everyone feels this way.  There's no justifiable reason to be sad about not being able to stop aging.  If I'm justified in being sad about that, everyone on the planet should be constantly walking around in a depressed mopey state.

I don't deserve sympathy for this either.  If I deserve sympathy, everyone deserves sympathy for we are all aging. 

Nobody will care and morally nobody should care except for people like me - mid/late 20's, well off, my only problem is that I'm going to die from aging.  I'd expect less than 1% of the planet would feel sorry for me.

And even then, so what?  The purpose of sympathy is to motivate people to lend a helping hand.  Nobody can help me, at least not yet.  Ghandi said ""be the change you wish to see in the world"", and that is so true, so it's really up to me right?

Okay... so why is this even sad in the first place.  I'm sad because this quest is causing me to lose out on a bunch of other things that I could be doing.  But I remember, now, the pitfall of measuring the opportunity cost of your own actions.  Every door you walk through also closes a million other doors, but if you never walk through any doors they might as well all be closed.

I don't get to pursue the perfect family environment.  
I don't get to join the Air Force.  
I don't get to be relateable.  
I don't get to hang out with the guys.  
I don't get likes on facebook.  
I don't get to commiserate with friends in a bar, drinking the night away and talking about the thing we are all interested in, interested down to the depth of our very being, that thing that defines all of us and that binds us together making us a strong team that can take on all challenges and overcome any obstacle.

I'm probably going to experience decades of failure.  I'm going to exist outside of the safe human existence, working toward something which may in the end be futile anyway.  And nobody will care, and nobody should care, because the current rules of the universe dictate that acceptance of death is morally correct and you shouldn't fight against it.

...

But humans couldn't fly for hundreds of years.  It was stupid, it was against our biology.  Flying humans?  If humans were meant to fly, we'd be born with wings.  You fucking morons, stop trying to make humans fly.  Stop it!  It's unnatural!  It's - oh, it's possible?  Well I knew it all along, it was inevitable.  I mean, birds do it, how hard could it have been, really.

I'm dumb.  At least, I'm going to be known as dumb unless I succeed.  Smart people know death is inevitable.  They look at the billions who died before them, and the billions dying now, and they realize the weight of it all.  Smart people say ""I accept death, and in the face of it I embrace life"".  And I'm forced to call them smart because they are accepting the reality of our situation more than I am.  I'm the one who isn't accepting reality, by trying to fight aging.  Ethically, I'm dumb.  But goddamnit I do not want to die.

*It's a selfish endeavor*.  *By wanting to live forever, you are cancer.  You are the cancer of the human race*.

No.  I disagree.  I've internalized death.  I've internalized the slaughter happening outside.  150,000 people per day.  That's worse than any war or human atrocity I've ever read about.  I don't just want immortality for myself, I want it for everyone.  I'm selfish but I'm also not selfish.  

I'm not cancer.  I don't know what I am, but I'm not cancer.  I'll mop floors for a thousand years if the universe granted me immortality.","2015-07-30 22:33:01","7","4","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/3f7v00/im_not_justified_in_my_sadness_and_thats_pretty/","True","My_Work_Is_Easy","1747846638.768617","our planet is dying","manual"
"3bw9ya","vegan","unknown","I feel as if we're on the verge of a goddamn catastrophe and NO ONE FRIGGIN CARES! *RANT*","Ok, we all know how the climate change is a bad thing, how humans are actively contributing to it and what the consequences will be... but, **do we**? I mean, have all of us (not just vegans but other people too) just assimilated all that info and accepted it as *oh is just one of those things that happen*, *i gueeeess we'll be fine!*.  I mean... I don't want to act like a lunatic but have we actually resigned to our doom? WHY ON EARTH it seems like no one gives a flying fuck?! 

Where does all of this comes from you ask? I was watching *cosmos* on netflix last night, and the episode starts off showing a cgi about how venus used to look like, huge mountains and deep gigantic oceans sprinkled with some volcanoes here and there...even a nice weather too, it could've sustained life... then it shows how venus is now, hell. It literally roasted the venera russian ship within a couple hours after it landed. 

Ok that's cool and all you say, well then the show goes back to earth, and shows how cute our tiny little refreshing planet is, and guess what? On a minor scale, we are following venus' footprints.

I'm not going to narrate here the whole episode, if you're interested you can watch it yourself, it's the 12th episode.

The thing is, there is scientific consensus on earths climate change, **we are the goddamn problem** and have been for the past 100+ years. We are actively destroying our planet. Everybody knows this, right? Then **what** the heavens are we actually doing about it? I mean... I even made my own groceries shopping bags out of some spare cloth I had, I've been vegan for 2+ years, I recycle, I try to lower my negative footprint in any ways possible... And then I come home and see my freaking family bought literally a pair of sodas, and they just HAD to bring them home on a plastic bag... two fucking sodas, that's the same amount of freaking hands you have! WHY?! People eating stuff, driving stuff, buying, using, wasting, all as if people actually have extinction as their goal! NO one gives a rat's ass! WHY WHY WHY WHY! No one wants to change *ANYTHING*... and I just had to come here, the most reasonable place I know where to rant and say something about it... People don't like the economy? Oh lets ocuppy wall street! People are stealing away our colective future? Oh that's *fine* now feed me some BACON LOL.

And then I see people with newborns and pregnant wifes saying shit like ""yeah i want the best for my son"" NO YOU FUCKING DONT! YOU ARE ACTIVELY DESTROYING YOUR SON'S FUTURE IN EVERY SINGLE WAY YOU CAN! But they don't see things that way do they? They're talking about money and college diplomas, nice fancy cars... well those things will be worth shit in the next 35-50 years. I mean, [these charts](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/images/science/ScenarioGlobalTemp.jpg) don't even require you to be a genious, you just have to understand that the more red=the hotter it will be. How on earth do people see that as ""the best for their sons""? All the info is at a click's reach, yet what do people use the internet for? *sigh* 

I'm starting to believe we deserve whatever's coming, people would rather die driving their suv out of a fast food joint than truly changing the things we're headed to :(

Thanks for reading.

"3dlx7g","vegan","unknown","Why I went from pescetarian to vegan","Last year I was a pescetarian.

When people asked me about not eating meat, I would explain that I did in fact still eat fish. Instead of explaining that it was a transitional period towards vegetarianism for me, I would make it light-hearted and joke that it was because 'fish don't make a sound when they die'. 

The truth was that animals from the sea were the last thing for me to remove from my diet because they were the animals I could relate to the least. I hadn't even begun to consider that fish most likely experience the most pain and suffering than any other farmed animal on the planet. 

Crushed by other bodies, suffocated to death in thousands, brought up from the depths at such speed that their bodies implode from the decompression. Cut open and gutted whilst still alive without a thought. If this was done to a mammal there would be an outrage even if they were cows. People would rise up even if chicken were treated in this way. Well, perhaps not. But it would be easier to make that sympathetic emotional leap.

Fish feel pain just like any other sentient creature. They have social groups and individual personalities. Yet, even as someone who had made a conscious decision to not pay for or consume dead bodies, I still had no issues with eating fish for an entire year.

It wasn't until I discovered the horrors of the dairy industry, which is worse than the meat industry and also *includes* the meat industry, that I abstained from animal 'products' altogether.

Peta and other animal charities rarely focus on the plight of fish because they know people don't have as much of an emotional connection to them. They are aliens to our world. And yet they deserve the same amount of consideration as any other animal.

It was a meat eater, of all people that helped me see that. When she asked if I still ate fish and I told her I did, she replied with, 'see, that pisses me off! How can you go vegetarian for all animals except fish? That doesn't even make any sense"". 

For the longest time, her comment made me angry. I was fuming. How dare she judge my diet when she says she loves animals while she eats them? Eventually I came to the conclusion that she was in fact, right - despite her own actions. And I became vegan not long after due to a myriad of other things that helped me in my decision.

Last year I visited Sardinia as a pescetarian and ate fish almost every single day. This year I'm visiting as a vegan. So much has changed in such a short about of time and I never realised just how exciting it would be to cut myself off from having anything to do with the suffering I hate.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger :) I will use it towards my quest to promote veganism!","2015-07-17 09:46:07","178","41","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3dlx7g/why_i_went_from_pescetarian_to_vegan/","True","IDGAFsorry","1747846756.927798","our planet is dying","manual"
"3c0sl6","futurology","unknown","About advanced alien civilizations","It just struct me from seeing other post, what would AI do to this planet? [Other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3bzabv/i_think_humanityagi_will_eventually_intervene_in/) It could give each species what they need most. What we, humans really need is to satisfy our body and minds. Whole other nature can live with eachother, as long as we don't destroy their habitats.

So it led on to think, AI might then guide us with virtual reality and relocation away from the planet. Along with infinite power source from some star for example, we could replicate any amount of food we require. Do we really *need* a planet to live like that? Perhaps you can just plop a big bubble on one and call it separated from the nature, but in the end it's not that safe longterm plan. Planets are always in a shift with earthquakes, asteroids, volcanoes and eventually sun dying out.

So have we been looking in the wrong place? What i think advanced civilization would do is kind of a giant mothership. I know the idea of big spaceships is not new, but i think those ships have to be their base lifeline. Able to relocate to other star systems when necessary.

So if you try sending radio signals to other planets in hopes of finding life, it might be a doomed idea to begin with. It would have to be a civilization with age that matches our own. Odds are just vanishingly tiny. They could however reach a mothership (or what should i call it, a colonial ship?), orbiting the star.","2015-07-03 18:49:40","4","11","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/3c0sl6/about_advanced_alien_civilizations/","True","Zaflis","1747846920.041279","our planet is dying","manual"
