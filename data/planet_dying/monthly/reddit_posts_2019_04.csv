"bgdleg","climate","scientific","""We are in the endgame now""","*THIS IS NOT A MARVEL SPOILERS POST I PROMISE, but I hope this gives you a new perspective about life.*

As the release of the newest addition to the Avengers series comes closer and closer, I've come to realize something. Remember how Dr. Strange said that he'd watched exactly 14,000,605 scenarios of the future but only one scenario existed in which they made it out alive, that they were able to win?

Yeah. We, Earthlings (all animals and plants), don't have a real Dr. Strange to tell us about how many scenarios he can see for our future, but I can pretty much guarantee that we too have only one (1) scenario in which we can all make it out of this mess alive.

We are practically the last generation that has a fighting chance at saving this planet, and I don't mean it in a ""The fate of the Universe is on our shoulders."", but I mean that the futures of Nemos and adorably helpless polar bear cubs DO rest on your shoulders. We have a chance to be the Guardians of Earth, and we can be, if we just stand and stake claim on our only successful future scenario and demand that it be accessible to us. But how do we do that? Look at what the phenomenal Greta Thunberg is achieving while you're reading this post. Climate change strikes and protests are definitely the ""Grab the attentions of our governments that enable the top 1% (who are majority of the fucker-uppers of our planet btw).""

But I don't even expect or want you to go step outside your house to make a contribution to our Endgame. It can start from your house itself. It could literally could be anything as simple as using a little less water during your next shower, planting an undemanding plant, taking less food onto your plate if you feel you can't eat it all, buying less plastic dependant items ranging from food to shampoos. Hell, you can even watch Lil Dicky's Earth and contribute to this fight! It's really that simple my sweets.

I don't live in a 1st world country, but relatively speaking, the 1st world countries' citizens are the most enabled bunch of people I've ever seen. Because comparatively, YOU have more power and resources to fight back with in this Endgame, you definitely have more power and resources than the toddlers dying of dehydration in Yemen as you're reading this sentence.

If you're still here and reading this, let me tell you about what will actually happen if we lose this Endgame in 11 years:

• The temperature will rise by a few degrees (1.5°C/ 34.7°F), and everyone keeps talking about the glaciers are going to melt and floods are going to displace 24 million people as climate change refugees, blah blah right? Well, it's also going to affect food. How? Rice and wheat (products of which are the basic components of your daily meals) will show a reduced growth rate due to the deviation from their optimal growth temperature. So, you can say goodbye to abundant pizza consumption at a decent price or even a comfy waffle in the morning without crying over an empty wallet.

• Animals from the Wild to your aquariums will not be able to reproduce normally, because they too will face a deviation from their optimal temperature for reproduction.

• Oh yeah, Polar bears definitely won't be alive because, as we speak, Polar bears have been found to drown after going to sleep because the piece of ice that they were sleeping on either broke or drifted away from the mainland, marooning them. This can happen to almost any animal living in the artic regions.

There are so many other technical impacts that I could go into and eventually bore you, but all I need you to understand is that, each and every one of you is an Avenger. The Earth doesn't need us to avenge her as she's more than capable of taking care of herself, but I feel like we owe it to our children, nieces, puppies, Simbas, super blooms, future space discoveries, literally anything that you love or care about at this moment. I think we owe it to them to take a stance in this Endgame.

We will all stop talking about Avengers: Endgame in a few months, but our Endgame doesn't stop there. We've got a long way to go in a really short period of time. So, come, help me and the next person win this war for our collective future.

Be the Avenger that our future deserves, because, my friend ""We are in the endgame now.""","2019-04-23 07:40:58","0","0","0.44","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bgdleg/we_are_in_the_endgame_now/","True","tapiocafoxtrot","1747926238.196824","our planet is dying","manual"
"b8292z","environment","emotional","Most serious read of your life","I AM DYING*  to aware you & open minded there is a -SPIRITUAL BATTLE- happening rite now ! God or Alien or Earth is upset ! We have evidence! 


we are a scientists co: turned alternative experimenters! (Trying youtube)

 *People* *with* *A* *Brain* *Read* !!! ⤵

We are from the united kingdom & we are here to spread some light upon secret science GOD & SCIENCE are ONE? Either way we need to spread awarness NOW not later or tomorrow NOW. together us! 






⤵
Theres secrets in Sacred geometry,frequency and vibration! https://youtu.be/SY5SmzqUeyY real life magic😨yes REAL! **Modern music & TV is poisening our childrens minds! Manipulation is at play.billionaires run the world! Its happening rite now!, and here's how (and no not the plastic war killing our beautiful sea life thats another topic) 



⤵
the world is at a critical point in time .nature is 100% Stressed, Mankind is disorganized! we need to join and spread our points & discover the TRUTH as a collective ASAP! Instead of watching mainstream science and news! And cat videos ! We're born grow have kids raise them die? Is that all is to life? (Again another topic) 






⤵
lets take a closer look at natural disasters thats taking place all over the world rite NOW! Earth, natural and very unnatural. ⤵


In my early years we started researching by 
percentages and how they increase over a period of time,  increasing at a intense speed. Earth changes whether it's Grand solar minimum,⤵

 droughts related to forest fires, solar flares, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, increasing flooding around the world, potential magnetic reversal, enormous cracks and sinkholes, developing from the earth expanding and heating up from inside the Earth's core. What more signs does this civilization needs from ⤵


God or alien, (whatever you may believe)⤵









 If you take the time to research you will find out that there is a number of military exercises that took place in 2018. ⤵




The government is preparing for martial law. We have a increase in earthquakes 500% since 2012. In 2012, we began to research the percentage of volcanoes at that time. It was 30 volcanoes that year. Last year 2018 we had 40 volcanoes eruptions.⤵


 By the end of this year 2019 we will see 45 to 50 The increase of earthquakes throughout our planet has increased from 2012 through 2017 was 300% and 200% in 2018 a total of 500%. Also a 500% increase in meteors, ⤵

each day at least 8 to 10 and at night 8 to10. That's 16 to 20 in a 24 hour period. Increasing in droughts 40% and 300% increase in forest fire since 2016. 200% in 2018 alone. ⤵






Instead of regular amount of rain fall. The cloud formations are dumping billions of gallons in a 24 HRS. Resulting in a staggering 40% increase in worldwide flooding.& if that is not enough, large enormous cracks throughout the continents to throughout the world. A 40% increase in sinkholes.100% increase in landslides⤵








. From reliable sources we have much to share! What you hear on the the television or read on the internet, is nothing more than programming. ⤵






Earth's core heating? Outside force? human Agenda? Angry earth? God? Spiritual? Natural? every planet in our solar system seems to display sighns!
⤵





 .Researchers are stating that the loud booms that are being heard around the world, is the result of the Earth's crust separating from the mantle? If this continues and reaches 60% we will go through a magnetic reversal? ⤵

The flashes of light is the result of static electricity when the pressure is released. The problem is, there is not enough data and information dealing with the history of a magnetic reversal and of the Earth's crust separating from the mantle or poleShift ⤵


.If you look at the current events such as Fukushima which has been dumping 300 to 500 tons of nuclear waste since 2011. In the month of August 2018 dumped 920,000 tons of nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean, because there is no longer room for the storage tanks to hold the nuclear waste. Just December 2nd 2018 147 whales Beach themselves in New Zealand and now the Dolphins are coming up dead on Florida's Coast.⤵








 In the past year Chile, Argentina and New Zealand combined hundreds of whales and thousands of dolphins Beach themselves. It's all about greed Corporation and Corruption, is it not ? When a civilization has reached a peak or point that the planet can no longer produce or sustain life for the civilization. ⤵


The balance of negative and positive energy. The scale towards negativity is increasing at a normous rate, adjustments will be made. For example. Today 285,000 children was abandoned and 180,000 will end up in human trafficking. Children in Danger, santanic rituals, sacrifices and child enslavement. Death before born? Planned Parenthood? evil civilization? Is The sale of children Souls a commodity? pure evilness? ⤵

The continuation of persecution of certain religeons in modern times are increasing. Also today 135,000 people died of starvation and dehydration and none of this is on the news⤵

.






If that is not enough, China is building a super Collider, twice as big as the one in Switzerland. And CERN announce they are going to build another one ten times as big as the original ! .Basically CERN is determined to remove The Great Veil if you will?⤵

 its 100%, a high science technology interdementional computer! Either for travel or Aliens ?i dont believe its a good thing for sure! but for sure the billionaires are involved with the outcome!.The Illuminati is determined to activate it in the timeline that we are living in. To open it up and expose this planet to the darkness that has never been seen upon the face of the Earth.or so they believe! ⤵









Also leading the way on 5G! The dangers are real. DNA single and double strand breaks, oxidative damage, disruption of cell metabolised increased blood brain barrier ⤵

permeability, melatonin reduction, disruption to brain glucose metabolism, generation of stress proteins. Let’s not also forget that in 2011 the World Health Organization (WHO) classified radio frequency radiation as a possible 2B carcinogen. The list goes on and on. Artificial intelligence, RFID CHIPS and Transhumanism is here⤵








. RFID CHIPS is set up on the barcode system if you research Lucent Technologies. In which their logo is the snake chasing its tail which is a ancient symbol for Lucifer the company is owned by AT&T we deliver the world slogan.⤵


 Recently, it was announced that AT&T split into 3,One of Laboratory's , has been fresly renamed Lucent Technologies, Lucent's software. Their, formal Main office for years was 666 5th Avenue New York New York the building was owned by The Rockefellers, but recently purchased by Donald Trump's son in law. ⤵






The chip is based on the monetary system and in which will scan the chip that will be implanted between your right thumb and your index finger. They finally completed the technology in which the chip also has a GPS! If the RFID chip is removed once it receives oxygen the monetary system is shut off but the GPS will continue to operate!⤵








 The great & fearsome Solar Serpent who is pictured biting his own tail in a circle? Lucent's logo The fiery, red sun, or circle, is his image.How Strange that the logo for Lucent Technologies is a red circle?⤵



Modern day New Age and Freemasonry groups continue this ancient glorification of Lucifer? 1 prominent New Age organization is the Lucis Trust'. Its founder, Alice Bailey, hailed the horned 1 as ""bringer of light,"" the ""shining one."" he is, she trumpeted, the ""Illuminator of mankind. Since Bailey's global occult group, the Lucis Trust, reveres Lucifer and the Illuminator of mankind & also promotes Freemasonry,Illuminati with its Egyptian religion& many more cults?⤵







also believe that the event of the timelines was already known long before the universe was ever created by God or Alien .our civilization that has no direction and no definition of themselves, because we are lost in our own false reality? Failed civilisation? ⤵







WE DO A NEW TOPIC EVERY MONTH we inspect it to the best of our abilities, we are More for spreading the INFORMATION ! & videos are just for attention to the unknowing public .LATEST NEWS ⤵






You drink water with a memory! Try to drink as clean water as possible.The true nature of water, which is the source of life .is unknown. We still know very little about the fascinating properties of water and its secrets.⤵





Water hides a lot of power that we are able to release and shape with the help of the energy of our strong emotions, both positive and negative.Life as we know it is entirely dependent upon water to survive.yet most of us take this precious liquid for granted. We drink what comes out of the faucet or in bottle form from the gas station without a second thought, and it is not our fault because we are physically incapable of detecting the difference between good & bad water. ⤵



Sure it might be pure and have added minerals, but scientists are now discovering most human drinking water is considered to be dead, void of any energy.Crazy as that sounds, that is only the beginning of what they are discovering about water’s capabilities.⤵



A Russian scientist by the name of Dr. Konstantin Korotkov has developed an instrument that can determine the energetics of water. Anything that enters a strong electromagnetic field begins to emit light Greater the energy, the brighter the light.He found that ordinary drinking water contained little if any, energy. H2o with no human contact was shown to be 40,000 times more energetically active & its crystalline structure near to Perfection.* *⤵

Releasing this Friday April 5th, it showcases the changing climates, species going extinct, habitats getting destroyed, pollutants spreading, etc. 

Well it shows the good things first like most other nature documentaries, but then reminds its viewers of what actually is happening.

""Repeatedly, unambiguously, and urgently, Our Planet reminds its viewers that the wonders they are witnessing are imperiled by human action. After seeing a pair of mating fossas—a giant, lemur-hunting, Madagascan mongoose—we’re told that the very forests we just saw have since been destroyed. After meeting the endearing orangutans Louie, Eden, and Pluto, we are told that 100 of these apes die every week through human activity. We see Borneo’s jungle transforming into oil-palm monocultures in a time-lapse shot that is almost painful to watch. We’re told that Louie and Eden’s generation could be the last for wild orangutans.""

"bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","Anxiety, Annihilation, and You: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Collapse","The Collapse is inevitable and no one is doing anything about it, right? You know the solution, the answer to our problems that would turn it all around, if only people would just listen! Sustainable lifestyles, Geoengineering, better food distribution, Communist uprising, going green in '19, *not buying a new damn cell phone when a used one is just as good and the heavy metals involved are* blah blah blah...

News flash buddy, **it isn't going to happen**. I'm sorry, I wish it wasn't true, but it is. We've all seen the headlines, read the news articles. It's out of our hands now. The corporations and governments of the world are the ones who started this thing, and they're the only ones able to stop it, let alone turn it around. We all know the likelihood of that happening. 

This makes you anxious. Scared. Depressed. Suicidal even. If the end of the world is inevitable, why even bother, right? Stop. Take a second. Relax. Breathe. Even the most pessimistic projections give us a decade, and most scientists agree it's going to be 20 or so years before things get really bad.

Look, competing with each other over who can make the biggest drop in the bucket isn't doing anyone any good. You can't save the world by recycling and going vegan, and no CEO or politician would ever care to hear what you have to say, but you can still save yourselves. Anxiety and depression both stem from the same source: **Hopelessness**. A feeling of being unable to make a change or difference. Anxiety and depression are gifts from mother nature. Evolution has given us this primal fear, this deep-seated unsettling discomfort when faced with an issue. You just have to turn it into action. 

We're in a unique situation on this subreddit because we know what's coming. We've opened our eyes. When Miami is sinking, when LA is engulfed in fire, when a hurricane is knocking on the gates of the NYC sea wall, it will be far too late to act. So act now. Acquire skills while you still can. 

* You're a scared 18 year old who wonders why college matters anymore, or you're worried that you'll be left with a useless degree? Become a nurse, a doctor, an EMT. Go into the trades; carpentry, HVAC, electrical. Become a Water Resource Engineer. Get your degree in Sustainable Agriculture. Become a climate scientist yourself. I guarantee you the jobs I just mentioned will only become more valuable when shit gets hot.

* You already have a job or a career? Buy cheap land while the getting is good. Learn how to grow and preserve food there, or what animals are native and how to track them. Best case scenario: science was wrong and the climate doesn't get too bad, or maybe against all odds humanity pulls together and saves the planet. Now you have a nice ranch home in Colorado, or a nifty hunting cabin in Michigan. Worst case scenario: things get as bad as they say it will, and now you're way ahead of the people waiting in line for water in New Mexico. 

* *At the very least* start stockpiling food and water. Even just setting aside a few dollars for extra rice and beans every month or another gallon of water puts you in a much better position when things start going downhill. When you're better situated, acquire more skills. Learn to fix your car. Buy a gun. Take a survival course, or a martial arts class. Start a garden. You don't need to go full doomsday prepper here. Most of this shit could fit right into a normal persons' life. You just happen to have some perspective about the whole thing.

The point is to prepare. **Act**. Do something, *anything*, to improve your position, because sitting on reddit reading about how shit things are is not doing wonders for your mental or physical health. Use that anxiety, that fear, and turn it into a productive force. I promise you that even baby-steps towards progress will go a long way towards feeling better.

And for those of you that say there's no point, or that they don't want to live in a world where things are as bad as science is saying it can get? I promise you that you're wrong. The human drive to survive is powerful, so powerful in fact that I can practically guarantee you that you will still be hanging around with us when the SHTF. The question is do you want to be sitting in a refugee center in Phoenix, or dying of heatstroke in Houston? Or do you want to prepare now and be working your quiet farm in Oregon, hearing about these things over the radio? 

If you read this whole thing, thank you. I hope I can inspire even one person to act, or to be less anxious at the least. If I do, I'll be glad I wrote it. 

TLDR: Doom and gloom isn't helping anyone, you can't change anything, but you can act to improve your own circumstances.

Edit: Slight changes to grammar and spelling.

"bbzgvd","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","Just what is a Quasar? Talking it out to myself and black holes.","We have had actual images of quasars for a while now. Why would a black hole be anything special to us? The quasar is the beam of energy shot out from a supermassive and fast black hole, correct? Are quasar's on every black hole, or are they only on the really big ones? 
It seems black holes are all over space. So a massive sun, likely one with more mass than our own, eventually will peter out and die. But when it does it goes out with a bang. It transforms into a black hole. I assume it keeps it's momentum through space and then begins spinning faster while sucking in dust and asteroids and eventually planets and moons from it's solar system. The black hole just continues through space until it eats up other solar systems. Suns give the biggest boost in speed and power. 

Again though, what is a quasar? It is a beam from the black hole, but is it visible via simple magnification or is it invisible radiation? And aren't any actual images (Not just artist renditions) of a quasar actually a larger scale of a black hole? 

Also, if black holes just shoot through space, I wonder how a supermassive black hole ends up at the middle of pretty much every galaxy. We're all like giant accretion discs all doomed to be sucked into the void. In some cases the galaxy is so giant that it reaches another galaxy before being swallowed by the black hole and it collides with another galaxy, causing a bigger accretion disk (Or what we know as a galaxy) and an even larger black hole. All of this seems to be destructive and decaying rather than creating and forming. All I see is a progression of what was once alive, dying and taking everything with it with nothing to stand in its way except a bigger, deader fish.

We only have one earth and we can't replace it. A lot of the damage we've done is irreversible and we probably have about 20 years left at the most. All the while people will go on and on about celebrities on twitter and completely wrap themselves in a world sheltered from the astounding truth that our planet is dying. 100 companies contribute to 71% of the worlds pollution but still people don't bat an eye about it because they would rather care about what's currently popular and act like everything is okay. I'm sure that if this came up on a global scale where people started to care that it would get shut down and people would be paid off to stop talking about it because of the mass corruption and money being the only thing on everyone's mind. Once we tip the scales where we're too far gone, then and only then will people care enough to do something about it but then it'll be too late. Humanity knows nothing but destruction.

"bfuvmj","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","Humans fatigue after Sri Lanka attacks","I'm usually one angry SOB. I was living in Paris during the attacks, and I made it a point to go and have a stroll the very day after the attacks in the neighbourhoods where the attacks took place so as to show that I didn't care how many attacks all the arseholes capable of doing that kind of thing perpetrated, there would always be more people *not* doing that, so they couldn't win in the long run.

I'm cynical, depressed and tonight that attack took its toll on me. I'm still angry, but sadness made its comeback, hard, somehow.

&#x200B;

I never watch TV, and I never open a TV programme, but I did tonight (living at my parents' again temporarily) after that because I was dumbfounded, and that was so depressing too : BS everywhere. BS programmes on the telly, BS articles about some woman in some reality TV show just because she went bare chested or some other prick who's doing nothing noteworthy and yet elevated to worthy-ish status, BS slogans on BS ads as usual, to the point of caricature (""it's more than a coffee, it's an opportunity to gather round and share something"" or whatever the exact phrasing was).

&#x200B;

And all the while people swallow all this shit from professional bullshitters who are full of absolutely nothing but shit, batshit crazy motherfuckers will go *kill* people. Maybe they were total arseholes trying to convert others with their religion (not going to write down BS religion cos that's a bloody pleonasm). Religion does poison everything, but people let their lives be poisoned by it.

&#x200B;

Politicians, advertisers, dumb fucks obsessed with money, fame, power, religion, self-image, everybody is so fucking full of shit I'm sick of it.

&#x200B;

What do I do to change this ? Nothing. I'm depressed, useless, and quite aptly, I hold my fair share of shit.

&#x200B;

I'm convinced if we were educated better and regulated our birthrate better and if the handful of sons of bitches who own and sold the world actually pulled out their fingers of each other's arses we might have a chance. But even they have superiority / inferiority complex with daddy issues and that smug selfish indifference I might have had too if I'd been born in the right place.

&#x200B;

Because for all my reflections, they're the reflections of one not in power, and I can't know what I would do in those motherfuckers' place. It's occurred to me recently that it's really just wishful thinking when we hear about something appalling and we say ""this is inhuman"" or ""these people are not human"". Well tell you what, it's human alright. It's just that ""human"" is just yet another bullshit fairy tale word that we tell ourselves so we can sleep at night with all the self-righteousness that we hold, so full of shit as we are.

&#x200B;

Can't remember which show George Carlin repeated ""full of shit"" as a glorious mantra, I'm going to look it up again, watch that part of the show, maybe I'll find some sleep fooling myself again, thinking that it's ok to be part of this species.

&#x200B;

Having worked in high end hotels, I suppose one could say I was kind of traumatized by the differences of lives between the clients I saw every day and that of me, and of beggars right outside the hotels, and that of those poor souls who make 90% of the clothes and electronics that surround me in my rich country full of also poor people.

One guy once paid €30,000 for a fucking fortnight at a hotel. I figured at that time, well those are the people that we really care about. I calculated how much a hotel-full of people with that kind of self-worth were equivalent to in average French workers salary. How many months of minimum wage it would take to equal a lifetime of this guy. And how many months, how many people in Bangladesh, or Congo. I made myself not remember the figures, made me dizzy. And then it occurred to me, in lives counted as money, which is a pretty good representation of a person's worth in our world, at a T moment when the hotel was full, there was the equivalent of a whole fucking country sleeping, eating, fucking and shitting right there and then, and if I were to find an automatic weapon, get there in the middle of the night to the top floor and managed to kill every last motherfucking last one of them, it would be like committing a full-blown genocide, since killing one rich fucker would equal 100, 1000 poor devils in money term.

&#x200B;

I'd thought of committing suicide for a long time before that, and I quit soon after thinking that, because I thought that since I might be leaving, I might as well leave taking some of those selfish arseholes along with me, to show the world that there exist some half educated people among those they despise so much, and that they should think twice how they treat their chai wallah.

I quit because I was becoming mad. And I think that I was just becoming that fucked up zeitgeist.

&#x200B;

I don't know how I would have felt if I'd been at my worst of those moments when those attacks happened. Attacks in churches and *in luxury hotels*. But today I'm just sad. I don't want to have anything to do with all this anymore, I'm done. But I shouldn't be done, because I should find a way to help the world slow down and stop acting like this. Stop this religious bullshit, stop this economic growth madness, stop [the way people fuck and breed way too much](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#pastfuture). Mindless madness everywhere. Stupid tribalism rampant everywhere.

I don't even know the first thing about myself, what am I to help it all. I can't argue with flat-earthers *against all the proof you can find,* people who believe Trump will save them *without reasonable proof*, people who believe their warlord/paedophile/polygamist of a prophet *without reasonable proof*, those in X subreddits who won't let me say this because I'm gonna hurt the feelings of ""peaceful"" people who believe that, all the while ignoring that their fucking ""holy"" book preaches fucking over perhaps more than half of India (polytheists), all jews, all atheists, homosexuals et caet-the-fucking-ra. I don't have the energy to debate Ben fucking Shapiro and Marine Le-fucking-Pen and Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May and Erdogan and fucking Jeff Bezos, many of those with better credentials, better IQs and yet scoring so poorly on the so-called scale of ""humanity"" in my book.

I'm an ant, an antsy ant, meaningless. And I yet, like plenty of others tonight, I'm sad because more than 200 of ants, many of whom I would probably have despised for their attitude towards others (careless rich people, evangelizing sons of bitches of whatever religion trying to tell me how you should fuck your spouse), more than 200 of people who still are ants like you and me died because our species is so fucking lost I could cry. I did actually.

We know the world of humans is a fucked up place, and most of us scarcely ever take the time to make the list of all the ways it's fucked up, but like all things fucked and messed up, I think it's good to just pause the game, make the list of all that's fucked up so we can see things for what they are. And it's not pretty. But doing that right now, I dunno… I need this now.

\- Tribalism rules this world. Men with men, browns with browns, whites with whites, X religion with X religion, X sports team with X sports team, X family with X family, X political affiliation… Gonna defend the tribes I feel I belong to even if such and such tenet and individual are in the wrong just because.

\- Power, sex and money rule this world. I want to work as little as I can, and fuck whoever I want (grab'em by the pussy, have several wives brozer… universal basic animal breeding shit), assert my dominance over everyone else so I decide over everything. Let the weak work in my stead, that's the natural order of things. They want to eat the cake, learn to fight bitch.

\- Economy is a self-aware entity. It's really skynet. No one can stop the trading game in Tokyo, Frankfurt, New-York etc. Humans don't preside over that, and that presides over everything. Maybe if the Koch brothers, Rupert Murdoch, Li Ka Ching, Bill Gates, Lakshmi Mittal, George Soros and a couple of others decided it should change maybe it might, but I don't honestly think so.

\- Many, many people work in automaton mode, we'll all prisoners of some sort of trauma / brainwashing that we can't really break free from. If you become a lawyer or a surgeon in the process, good, you don't have to listen to as many people's bullshit everyday, and you can make a couple listen to *your* bullshit because otherwise they won't be able to breathe and eat for long. Coercion is a wonderful thing.

\- Selfishness is a vital trait of our nature. Btw tribalism is just selfishness pretending to not be what it is.

\- Bigotry gives a simple view of the world, it's reassuring, and completely stupid. Everyone, everywhere loves loves loves telling themselves the right lies so they can keep their head up high in their tribe and in their poor, petty, miserable self-righteous little proud minds.

Like I said, I know I'm not the cleverest brain on the planet and I know I'm missing a lot to get a better overall picture, but I'm clever enough, and I've seen enough of the world I think to know that no matter how complicated the world might be, the powerful ones are neither the most ethical nor the best overall people for the job. The system has naturally evolved to that situation. It makes sense, but it doesn't mean that it's not fucked up. Now I almost don't feel like fighting for what I assume is good (not sure of much anymore tonight), I just half-arsedly wish all good people committed suicide now so the rats leftover fight for the throne of the kingdom of rats, and live rats amongst rats, as the rule of the survival of the fittest seems to make our species go towards unfailingly.

I have been tired of myself for a long time, and tired of the world at large for a long time too, but tonight it's just one hopeless notch further than I imagined I'd feel. I'm bamboozled, I've no idea what to say or do or think, no idea which way to go. I'm tired of myself and my species which seems to be doomed to hurt itself for as long as two members still breathe on this planet.

I don't have a good way to end this desultory, haphazard rant. Stop hurting people ? Pause the world ? Talk again, get angry with words and make bad things stop happening with muscle but don't kill ? I don't know. I don't fucking know but that's the point tonight. I feel sadness, and fatigue. Very, very despondent too – that's one word we miss in French, despondent. hdlo out.","2019-04-21 23:04:54","4","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/bfuvmj/humans_fatigue_after_sri_lanka_attacks/","True","hdlo","1747927209.36132","our planet is dying","manual"
