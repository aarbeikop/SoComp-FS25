---

This happened two days ago, and my anger still hasn't worn off. I mean **holy fuck**, I can not believe people are actually that fucking clueless.

I was on a trip with omni friends and we were at a bus stop, gathered around a bag of vegan snacks I had brought in case I couldn't find anything to eat. My friends were just trying out some snacks, and some other guy from our travel group must have overheard our conversation and asked me why I was vegan.

I said for ethical reasons, and that I think it's wrong to kill and exploit animals for your own pleasure if you don't have to.
He proceeded to ask what's wrong with milk (""You have to milk cows, so why not drink the milk?""), so I explained how it really works.

Then he asked me if I've ever heard of some Chinese tribe or culture that doesn't eat onions and potatoes because they think it's wrong to kill plants (he didn't say why it's not wrong to kill plants other than onions or potatoes from their point of view). I, somewhat flabbergasted by this supposed ""argument"", said that I didn't believe that because we have scientific evidence that suggests otherwise. **And he honestly fucking laughed at me** as if to say: ""Dude, you see? You're just picking and choosing what you want to believe"". I then explained that organisms without a central nervous system cannot feel pain, and the laughing continued.

He continued to ask me if I know that mushrooms have an incredibly complex system of roots and can communicate with one another, and I said that I did know that. And then he said that we apparently don't know that animals really feel pain and that plants don't. I conceded that, no we don't know 100% due to that fact that we can't look into another consciousness, but an overwhelming amount of evidence points in the direction that this is in fact the case. But it just provoked the same response as before, this guy was just utterly immune to evidence.

Having never before been confronted with such utter and cartoonish ignorance, I was honestly so shocked by the fact that this guy actually seemed to believe what he was saying, that I didn't even think of asking him about the planet sized holes in his logic. Instead I just urged him to gather some information on his own if he didn't believe me and if the topic interested him further. I told him to look into what it is actually going on inside a slaughterhouse, so that, even if he is OK with animals being killed, he actually knows what it is he is deeming moral. That seemed to give him a little bit of pause, and the laughing died down a little, but I still feel that he left thinking everything I said was ridiculous.

---

Reading other posts like this was oftentimes kind of funny to me, but actually experiencing this behavior first hand is just infuriating and soul crushing. Anyway, I could really use some cheering up right about now since my faith in humanity is kind of in the toilet. Hope you all have a good day.","2017-08-16 16:08:07","35","28","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/6u323y/i_always_read_about_peoples_utter_ignorance_on/","True","crossbreed55","1747890833.947074","our planet is dying","manual"

There exists a relationship between sightings of UFOs, contact with Extraterrestial Intelligence, and Psychic Phenomena. Intelligence agencies across the globe have come to this conclusion and the reason for their silence on these topics is that they still do not have a full grasp on what exactly the implications of these topics will have on the population.

To fully understand this relationship, we must get a grasp on each of these topics individually.
#Remote Viewing

##Project StarGATE
[CIA powerpoint on Project StarGATE](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00789R003300210001-2.pdf)

[Remote Viewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing) is a method of perceiving non-local information of the universe using the power of human consciousness. The CIA began studying the potential of Remote Viewing at [SRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International) in the 1960's with the famous psychic [Ingo Swann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann). The two most famous physicists involved in these experiments were [Russell Targ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Targ) and [Hal Puthoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff) who were very interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics which would allow for psychic abilities to operate.  Ingo was one of the first members of [Project StarGATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project) which was the study performed by the CIA to determine the weaponization capability of psychic phenomena. The reason the CIA was so invested in this area of research was that the Soviets during the Cold War had spent over 20 million Rubies by 1973 on a similar remote viewing/telepathy program ([source](http://blog.learnremoteviewing.com/?p=1562)). I will be referring to the CIA in this section because of their recent declassification surrounding a lot of these documents.

[This is an example](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030004-1.pdf) of using Remote Viewing (astral projection) to spy on a Soviet base off the Ural Mountains

[Here is a document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) purporting to show a Remote Viewing session of Mars at 1 Million B.C. which we will come back to later in the post.

##Revisiting Quantum Mechanics

[Nonlocality]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_nonlocality) is a property of Quantum Mechanics which states that entangled particles affect each others' quantum state instantaneously, seemingly transmitting information faster than the speed of light. In [this](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) CIA paper we gain insight into what the CIA calls [The Gateway Process](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/catalog/122) using [Hemi-Sync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-Sync) technology. This paper shows Wayne McDonnell writing to a commander:
> You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand how and why the process works

He then goes on to explain the foundations of [Transcendental Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation), [Brain Coherence](https://npepjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40810-015-0015-7), [Holograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), a universal consciousness matrix, [OBEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience) and much more. He does all of this to lay out the idea that under altered states of consciousness the human brain is capable of perceiving nonlocal information and capable of interacting with a holographic underlying framework to the universe.

As if this isn't strange enough, there is a really shocking point at the end of this paper in McDonnell's conclusion. After describing how to induce the gateway experience in an individual, he states:
>Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeeded

This is important because it establishes precedent from a CIA document that human beings are capable of interacting with intelligent entities while being in an altered state of consciousness.

###Relevant CIA papers challenging current academic stance of Quantum Mechanics

[The Bohm-Aharanov Effect and Scalar Interferometry](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900680014-4.pdf)

##Quick aside - Connection to DMT?
There is a lot of research done by people such as [Terrence McKenna]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna) which shows that psychedelic drugs (which places the subject in an altered state of consciousness) often cause the subject to see and interact with seemingly intelligent entities while tripping. [This great article](https://www.sociedelic.com/apparent-communication-with-discarnate-entities-induced-by-dmt/) shows an undeniable correlation between ingestion of psychadelics and contact with intelligent entities.

##Remote Viewing and Humanoid Contact
Revisiting the [Mars paper](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) with this new insight into the Gateway Experience we gain a better understanding of the purpose of the experiment. After having the subject place themselves on Mars at approximately 1 million B.C., the subject observes some type of mass geological event. He is asked to move in time to before this event, and we get the following interaction:
>SUB: I'm seeing ah.... It's like a perception of a shadow of people, very tall... thin, it's only a shadow. It's as if they were there and they're not, not there anymore.

>MON: Go back to a period of time where they are there.

>SUB: I just keep seeing very large people. They appear thin and tall, but they're very large. Ah... wearing some kind of strange clothes. 

>MON: All right, now holding in this time period, holding in this time period, I want to move from your physical location in space to another physical location, but in this time period.

So we find that the time of interest in this experiment was *specifically* the time period when some type of humanoids were supposedly living on Mars. The experiment then goes on to hit major geographic points on Mars where the subject describes Pyramids, Obelisks, and large megalithic structures. The experimenters are not remotely surprised to find humanoids on the surface of Mars, in fact it appears to be the entire purpose of the experiment: To observe geographic locations of Mars which might have once supported actual humanoid life over a million years ago. When the subject makes contact with another humanoid, we get the following exchange:
>MON: Move close to one of them and ask them to tell you about themselves.

>SUB: They're ancient people. They're ah... they're dying, it's past their time or age. They're very philosophic about it. They're looking for ah... a way to survive and they just can't seem to get their way out, they can't seem to find their way out... so they're hanging on while they look or wait for something to return or something coming with the answer...

> MON: What is is they're waiting for?

>SUB: A group of a party of them that went to find ah...new place to live. It's like I'm getting all kinds of overwhelming input of the corruption of their environment. It's failing very rapidly and this group went somewhere, like a long way to find another place to live.

...

>MON: All right, now before you leave this individual, ask him if there is any way that you, ask him if he knows who you are and is there any way you can help him in his present predicament?

>SUB: All I get is that they must just wait. Doesn't know who I am. Think he perceives I'm just a hallucination or something.

>MON: Okay, when the others left, these people are waiting, when the others left, how did they go?

>SUB: ... It looks like the inside of a larger boat. Very rounded walls and shiny metal.

>MON: Go along with them on their journey and find out where it is they go.

>SUB: Impression of a really crazy place with volcanos and gas pockets and strange plants, very volatile place, it's very much like going from frying pan into the fire. Difference is there seems to be a lot of vegetation where the other place did not have it. And different kind of storm.

From this interaction, we get the impression that this experiment yielded information showing a tall, thin humanoid race living on the surface of Mars with an impending cataclysm. These people then leave Mars and arrive on a different planet with different problems but at the least a large source of vegetation.

#Wikileaks files implying Government knowledge and interaction with ETI / UFOs
It is tough to convince people in a couple short paragraphs that the government is aware of extraterrestials and have had a relationship with them since at least the 1950's, so I don't intend to spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader that this is the case. Instead I will cite documents which were released from Wikileaks to show you that at the very least there are official diplomatic cables and emails between high profile politicians and government officials which supports the idea that extraterrestials have visited Earth in the past and are more than likely still visiting us. This idea also includes the possibility that the Apollo program was not what it appeared to be at first glance.

Recently a congressman made headlines and subjected himself to media ridicule when he brought up the possibility that advanced civilizations had once lived on Mars.

Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., asked a panel of space science experts testifying before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on Tuesday if it's possible there was an advanced civilization on Mars in the past.

http://www.newsjs.com/url.php?p=http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/338374/dana-rohrabacher-asks-nasa-about-martians/

Speculation about possibility of intelligent life on Mars is nothing new, of course, though the notion was dismissed by NASA after the Viking mission. Not everyone who worked on the project agreed with the official conclusion, however. Starting with those early orbital images of anomalous features in the Cydonia region, a growing number of scientists around the world have been challenging the idea that Mars is a barren, lifeless desert, asserting instead that there was once a thriving civilization on Mars that left behind giant structures that have long since fallen into ruin. This post will attempt to make that argument featuring a number of the clearest examples of anomalies yet photographed by NASA on Mars and elsewhere in our solar system.



First things first, let's examine the definitions of pareidolia and pattern recognition according to Wikipedia.

Pareidolia is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to an image by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists. Examples of these would be seeing shapes in the clouds,or the face of Jesus in a tortilla chip.

Pattern recognition (in psychology as opposed to computer science) describes a cognitive process that matches information from a stimulus with information retrieved from memory.

 Let us begin with an anomaly imaged on the surface that is NOT an example of pareidolia:

https://i.imgur.com/NSULKCY.jpg

Another view of the same object:

https://i.imgur.com/FBUvZ5Q.jpg  

Three lines of equal length forming a pattern I'm sure you all recognize, an equilateral triangle etched into the surface of a rock, the base of which is in parallel alignment with the ground. There can be no argument for pareidolia against a simple geometrical figure, a thing either has the shape of a circle, square, triangle, cube or sphere etc. or it doesn't. The question then becomes, how did it get there? The In order to fit in to the current model according to NASA, the rock would have had to have been formed with the triangle already there, any natural process that could result in such a symbol etched into stone would require a much more dynamic collection of forces, having these forces come together to form even a simple geometrical symbol by wearing away the surface of a stone in such a specific way is so far outside the realm of probability that there can only remain one simple conclusion, namely, some intelligence put it there.

Game over, in other words. There was intelligent life on Mars, and may be there still. And yet, the existence of artifacts and ruins on Mars does not necessarily mean that the beings who created them were aliens. The simplest, most probable explanation is that they were us, humans. When you consider the rapid growth of technology that enabled us to go from heavier than air powered flight to landing on the moon within a single lifespan, the idea that human culture had once colonized our solar system before being wiped out by natural disaster (or war) seems quite plausible. In light of the evidence, this scenario is perhaps the most comforting to consider, without triggering the fear of hostile alien invaders from Mars that has been a part of western culture for over a century.

Now that we are clear on the difference between pareidolia and pattern recognition, let's begin with some other examples of anomalies containing simple geometric features in a way that would be very difficult to explain as a result of natural processes.

Letters, numbers, symbols. This is where things get interesting. I don't care to speculate about how these symbols match some western cultures on earth but it's impossible to think about without imagining all sorts of science fiction tropes like time travel. At this point, however, no theory can be dismissed as ridiculous, every possibility should be open for debate, at least until the authorities step in and tell us what to think again. One thing's for sure, there are some fans of ZZ Top on the red planet. Can't say I'm surprised about that.

People. Humanoids anyway. Some look like the grey aliens we have become familiar with. Some look human, but too small to be human as we know them, or so was previously thought https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_skeleton. Could they be humans as we don't know them? Cousins, descendants or perhaps ancestors? I have no idea, but if what we see here is real, the implications are staggering.

Conclusions:

There once existed a thriving technological civilization on Mars, sometime when the planet had oceans, a very long time ago.

Mars currently has water, vegetation, wildlife, and people. Not human beings like us, but people nonetheless.

It's impossible for NASA to not know this. There is good reason to think that they are using image processing software to paint over the best artifacts. Whatever happened to Mars apparently created a massive, possibly planet wide debris field, artifacts are plentiful and difficult to conceal.


So the American government lies to the people of the world again, this time about the most important discovery in recorded human history, knowledge that will turn everything we took for granted as the truth about ourselves and render it the quaint backwards notions of a primitive, developing culture. I can't blame them for keeping such a powerful secret, how many of us are truly ready to confront the truth of our existence on a heretofore unimaginably cosmic scale? There exist similar anomalies elsewhere NASA has looked in the solar system, including Luna (Earth's Moon), Venus, Pluto, Phobos, Eros and Comet 67-p. We may not the big kids on this block, and almost certainly aren't the most developed species in our local neighbourhood. We aren't even the smartest species on our own planet. Cetaceans have highly developed brains that dwarf ours in size and capacity, and they have no technology at all, yet their languages are much more sophisticated than what currently passes for language among humans. We need to get over our collective sense of the human race's self importance.


Let's say that there is definitely a race of tiny humanoids living on Mars. How is the arrival of their neighbors from the third planet going to affect them? What's the most likely thing to happen, given that our civilization currently is a plutocracy ruled by a feudal cabal of ruthless psychopaths? Will they be given any say at all with what happens to them? If our leaders view the people of our planet with a range of feelings from indifference to contempt, how will they feel about a race of Lilliputians? 


The history of Mars is intertwined with the history of Earth. Has to be. The meaning of Cairo can't be just coincidence. I'm not up to speed with the hidden history side of this story, but I've seen and heard enough. Not that I don't have my own opinion on these matters. Some expertly qualified professionals have opined that the cataclysm that ripped away Mars's oceans (and reduced the fifth planet to what is now the asteroid belt) happened 65 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were extinguished on Earth. I may be just a self educated layman, but judging from the condition of the artifacts uncovered, this seems like too long an estimate. Ten thousand years or so seems more probable, considering that many of these objects are lying in the open and are still recognizable. Assuming there hasn't been several civilizations that have risen and fallen in the meantime, which is starting to look likely.

The world as we know it is on the cusp of disappearing forever, and it's about time, we have a much needed, better one to create, for the sake of all, not just humankind. It's time to put on our grownup pants and start dealing with the mess we've made.




This collection was gathered mostly from Facebook groups on the subject as well as online. I have had a few issues with getting the entirety of the collection onto Imgur to share, the program crashes frequently during large uploads and is very difficult to sort and organize. New photos will be added to this folder as I get them.

https://imgur.com/a/GN4wQ

Every time I had to delete my folder to properly upload, everything got doubled in my profile. Currently my collection stands at about 1900 images, my profile has over 4500. Opening via mobile redirects to the app.

To the best of my knowledge all of the Mars rover anomalies can be verified on the gigapans, the most interesting formations have been marked in the snapshots.

I'm not particularly interested in having a debate about the meaning of these images, but encouraging debate and raising awareness is why I'm doing this. I'm sure many of you will have an extremely negative reaction to the idea presented here, by all means feel free to analytically slice me to pieces. I'm confident that most people are able to ascertain the truth when they see it with their own eyes. You would have a better chance convincing me that the great pyramid of Giza was a natural formation than some of the objects in these photos.
