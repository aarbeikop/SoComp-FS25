"4f67he","collapse","skeptical","Humans are irrelevant","Here's something to consider for all of you:

[If we treat humans as a normal omnivore animal, the world has about 1000 times too many humans right now.](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/publications/misc_pdf/fowler-book/appendix06-4.pdf)

Think about the implications of that. India had 238 million people in 1901, 1210 million in 2011. Congo had 12 million people in 1950, 66 million in 2010. Brazil had 10 million people in 1872, 205 million people today.

What do you think happens when the fossil fuels run out, the farmland degrades and starvation becomes global? They're going to consume everything. Everything bigger than a rat might go extinct. Governments artificially maintain control over the teeming masses we created. The wildlife reserves are basically plots of forest with government-hired guys with guns standing around. We've reached a stage where they poison the horns, where they basically keep track of every big rhinoceros with a drone. What do you think happens when the government stops paying them, or when there stops being a government? It all dies.

Instead of asking yourself ""How do I survive the collapse"", the better question to ask is ""How do I ensure most people DON'T survive the collapse"". That's what you need to be asking yourself. Everyone wants to be ""the one"" who eats his stored food, shoots some deer in the forest and survives with an interesting story to tell to his grandchildren. That's what I hoped for, but as humans we need to reach for a goal higher than ourselves. In the words of Pentti Linkola: ""If there were a button I could press, I would sacrifice myself without hesitating, if it meant millions of people would die.""

The simple fact of the matter is as following: If you're not a Kalahari Bushman, if you're not an uncontacted tribe in Papua New Guinea or the Amazon forest or an Andaman islander, you quite frankly have no business surviving whatsoever. You're a product of agriculture and industrialization, the only reason you exist is because humans dominate 100% of photosynthetic capacity on plots of land that we deforested. You're a product of a civilization that emerged in the blink of an eye on a geological timescale. Civilization is 10.000 years old at most. The industrial explosion that reduces infant mortality below 1% and gave birth to an enormous mass of genetically degenerated humans as a consequence is 200 year old at most.

What about the species that are about to be lost forever? [Rhinoceros showed up on the scene over fifty million years ago.](http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/117/1175860259.pdf) What does a single human life matter if the Rhinoceros disappears from this planet forever? What do a billion of us matter? I want you to radically reconsider your bioethical inclinations, tainted by the human anthropocentric bias. Human life doesn't matter. Before you dismiss me, take a walk downtown and tell me how all these teeming masses enrich existence. They bother each other, there are so many of them that they can't walk in a straight line without interruption. They take each other to court, about the ownership of square inches of dirt. When a fox finds chickens living like that, he kills them all.

Biodiversity comes before all else. The creation of life is the only act of God that all cultures around the world agree on. Biodiversity is the product of the fundamental order of the universe, an uninterrupted signal transmitted for millions of years by the highest principles that gave birth to our physical incarnation. Seven billion apes are like a growing grey noise on the radio, until the message being broadcast can no longer be heard. The non-human species that came into existence are physical incarnations of Plato's theory of forms, they depict the highest most fundamental nature of reality, evolution itself is merely a mechanism by which the messages are shown to us spectators. Hence why nature has evolved a crab through multiple branches of life, hence why vultures in America and the old world look similar despite not being related.

So, what must be done? All life that can be evacuated and survive outside of their current ecosystem must be evacuated. And the noise? The noise has to be removed from the radio.","2016-04-17 11:10:57","60","100","0.74","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/4f67he/humans_are_irrelevant/","True","knockknockitsmeagain","1747861964.131331","our planet is dying","manual"
"4eq4bn","conservation","scientific","Is conservation important?","I would like to apologise up front for my wording or this. Putting thoughts into text has always been an issue for me. So onto the question: Is conservation important? And why is it or isn't it? A question was posed to us in a geography class. ""Why save the rhinos? Why bother? We should be worried more about ourselves surely? We should fight for ourselves shouldn't we?"" He continued to question the importance of conservation of nature. His reasons being that, for example, the rhino doesn't play a huge role in the ecosystem. This is probably true, the rhino going extinct would not have too many adverse effects apart from those on the rhino population of course. He was also insistent that continuing the human race it far more important and that conservation of the human race more crucial. So he argues if we want to stop greenhouse emissions it should be to save humans. I don't see why we would disagree with that. But then surely conserving nature would then help in conserving the human race would it not? Should the lone polar bear on melting ice not only worry us because it is fluffy and cute and dying but also because of the ramifications on the human race. It almost seems like a self defeating argument. We shouldn't conserve nature... But we should. So why should we conserve the natural habitats of our planet and why should we make an effort to save dying species(particularly from events that don't affect us e.g rhinos)?","2016-04-14 07:43:56","6","9","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/4eq4bn/is_conservation_important/","True","perpetualexemption","1747862034.171743","our planet is dying","manual"
"4flup5","vegan","unknown","Feeling pretty mad and isolated from the rest of humanity ATM","So I'm a biology major/animal rights advocate and the day I've been dreading but stayed quiet about came-  fetal pig dissection day.  A whole 2 hours of listening to other giggleshit students joking about how they named the dead fetal pig ""Hamlet"" and talking about how cute teacup pigs are that they've seen.  Gross shit about how their dead pig would have been a little boy or a little girl when they get to the reproductive organs.  I guess it's extremely funny to people that a pregnant pig as bled out and the babies torn from her uterus so we could could have some great dark fun today.  I honestly don't understand how people who heroically do undercover rescues of farm animals stand interacting with society after what they've seen, that we only get a tiny window into in the form of grainy youtube videos documenting abuse.  


It's put me in a garbage mood the last few hours.  I'm an adult and I feel vaguely embarassed because it sounds like I'm too old for this kind of ennui, but it's things like this that occasionally come along that remind me other people are emotionally alien to me.  Whether it's animal suffering or the suffering of people in developing countries effected by capitalism and imperialism, people simply don't seem to give a fuck about anything unless they're given some sort of social cue to pretend they care.  Maybe 1% of the population is capable of introspection or examining how their actions take a toll on others.  I'm beginning to believe this is simply an innately human flaw produced by millions of years of violent evolution.  It's the reason we have football stadiums worth millions of dollars while thousands of people die far enough away from us.  It's why climate change is going to cook the planet as violent selfishness takes us to our graves.  We really are a lost cause.","2016-04-20 05:21:22","6","1","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4flup5/feeling_pretty_mad_and_isolated_from_the_rest_of/","True","BiologyMisanthrope","1747862670.1496232","our planet is dying","manual"
"4evykt","futurology","unknown","what if we can read our memory out?","1:""who am I"",what memory in my brain decide who I am.this is the only 
answer.I can be lining,a Chinese or I can be Tom an American if I had adopted by 
an American family when I was a baby.so I am not must be lining by GOD,I am I 
now just because my memory.


2:what is life's meaning to us.all is feeling.I feel I am alive then I am 
alive.I feel who I am,then I am.it is work to everyone even scientist or 
illiteracy.we don't need anything to prove our life is live,just the feeling of 
our own is enough.


3:our technology is developed very fast now.I think we can read our memory 
by some machine one day soon after.so maybe some day we can have our own memory 
in our hands.then what would we think about it.if we can read our memory then we 
can expect the write technology.I have a idea about it now,we can read our 
memory into a chip then transplant it into a baby's brain(use my sperm or other 
way).then following the baby's growing up,there like a sound deep in his heart 
told him about his pre-life.then some day he old enough to recognize these 
information.then ""I"" am back.this just like parents educate their child who he 
is.just one outside and one inside.


4:we can't reject whatever memory in our brain.unless there has already had 
a set of memory.for example:I have my own memory,so you hard to change my 
identity to myself.but if I am a baby,not any memory,so you told who I am,then I 
think who I am.


5:we all will die at some day.and what is death like?it is a example:""are 
you sleeping""""yes,I am.""""you lie to me"".we don't know we are in sleep and when 
we were in sleep.it is the feeling of lose consciousness.so we can image a scene 
or feeling:""are you died?""""yes,I am,I just died at 8:40 am.""""get the Fxxx 
off"".you never know you are died if you are died.even who you are.


6:so if I am on my last day,and my memory(new updated) in my hand.I will 
think if I put(write) this into a new body if I can live again.use my sperm to 
make a new body.refer to above about what is life meaning for us,what is 
""I"",what feeling is death.I call this new life is TA(Chinese spelling,the 
meaning is she,he ,it).the whole process to me just like a sleep time.I fall 
sleep in an old body and wake up in a new body.


7:TA's body can supply consciousness to me make me feel I am still alive 
but just change a new body and my memory in TA's brain can decide I am still 
that ""I"" .so TA's life is not so different to us now.we use our body's 
consciousness to make up our memory and feel alive.we use our memory to decide 
who I am.so we can be immortal from then in this way.the only way TA's life 
different to us is TA do not need rely on the only body to survive.this kind of 
life is totally freedom for us.


8:do you think you will choose this way to prolong your life in your last 
day?or there are some people would do it?I think the desperation of when we face 
death will make us to make this choice,what can we lose when we face 
death.maybe there are still some people don't like this.but according to the 
huge advantage of TA to us now.TA will totally replace the current human life 
style,those who don't like it will died eventually by nature.and their 
descendant will accept this way.


9:gene technology and AI technology can provide various body to us in the 
future.it has some standards.1)can run our memory well.2)can easily get energy 
from the circumstance 3)less necessary of energy to survive.why these standards 
can be use.because more rely on energy or material then less freedom of life.I 
call this stage of life is observer(advanced TA),just watch the universe run,not 
participated.just like us watch TV series.


10:so human will ""disappeared"" in the future,our body can be any kind of 
shape.and we do not need to occupy any other planet.if we are interesting of 
that planet and those life on it.we can be them (alien can be human live on the 
earth for a while and leave when it want to travel in the universe again with 
change a new body to fit the new circumstance).


11:this is the only way to our future.whenever we make the read&write 
memory technology come true,TA will come.in 100 years or 1000 years?it is long 
time to human but it is too short to universe.can we ban this technology 
develop?can we ban TA?I don't think so.because it is the best desire for us,we 
all(most) want live(health) as long as possible.ethics always changed to adapt 
the human society's need.maybe it will delay TA come but can stop TA's 
coming.


12:we are alien too.at least I can confirm two common things to any alien 
in this universe.1)we are all creature, so we all have the strongest desire for 
live.2)we all have intelligence.that mean we all have memory(data for run).so if 
there is an alien civilization.they must meet the problem of their memory just 
like us in their civilization's development.so they(alien) must in the same way 
I said before.this is the reason of why we are alone .all intelligence 
creature's civilization will evolve to TA and ""disappeared"".so this is the explanation of Fermi Paradox


13:3)the movie ""Big Hero 6 "",do you remember the ending of this story.Hiro Hamada 
use the chip of Baymax'memory to make the past Baymax come back.you see,if we 
can have our memory in hand.everyone would do it.if you search the key word 
""read memory technology""or other words on google,you can find many articles.it's 
not my whim,we actually on the way to TA.TA is our destination can't avoid.if 
you follow the clue to going on.you will find a lot of very interesting things can change your mind about the world.","2016-04-15 09:29:07","2","1","0.63","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/4evykt/what_if_we_can_read_our_memory_out/","True","puzzlerch","1747862747.229978","our planet is dying","manual"
