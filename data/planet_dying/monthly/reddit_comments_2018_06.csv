"e1gzo76","t3_8uo4s7","8uo4s7","collapse","skeptical","I did the same thing last year. I came to the realization that I wasn't going to retire so I took 7 weeks off and hiked, kayaked, camped, met cool people, did drugs, went to music festivals,  visited friends that lived far away from me. It felt good. 

Part of my trip was hiking the W in Torres del Paine national park. It required booking tickets and hostels several months in advance. Being an avid /r/collapse reader, I really started to get nervous a SHTF moment would happen before I ever got to do anything fun. Once I got out, I was fine if civ collapsed or my life collapsed but I would have been pissed if something happened that triggered a fast collapse and I spent my whole life in school or a crappy job. 

Now I'm back to having a shitty job and I'm itching to run away again. So yeah do it. Do it now. Even if the techno optimists are right, that doesn't mean you're going to live forever. Do what you want to do. There's no rules for how to live your life. The default thing to do - get a job, have kids - is destroying the biosphere, you're free to not do that. It's probably better if you don't. 

This will sound dumb (as in cliche and not profound). I don't share it IRL but I'm on the internet so I don't care what people think - A mantra that I like to live by came from an EDM song ""do what you feel like, who fucking cares, heaven is so close, just be prepared""","2018-06-29 00:28:40","10","[deleted]","1747909673.456502","our planet is dying","manual"

I think we take a very privileged perspective of the ""wonder of nature."" I think there's a very harsh reality that nature is also exceedingly rough around the edges. It's not like before human society existed we were in perfect union with nature. The earliest humans murdered each other. Everyone died by our standard of ""middle age"" from starvation and disease. 

I don't think many humans pre-civilization sat back and marveled at the wonder of nature, because there wasn't anything else in contrast. They probably hated nature. Nature was their primary oppressor. I'm just saying, that I think we fantasize about something that probably isn't a reality. 

But I do agree with you, our system is built around a shitty ideology that makes us use our immense resources to mostly gain worthless material and consequently destroy the environment.

I think we're kinda selfish to begin with and it only really takes an incentive of wealth and superficial stuff to get us to forget about anyone but ourselves.

But your average Fox News viewer isn't actually going to hurt anyone. The worst they'll do is make an ass of themselves in public, which is only a problem for them. Talk to them if you know them, try to get them out of the far right echo chamber if you can, but threatening violence is too much.","2018-06-22 01:41:58","1","tumblruser290","1747910038.8200278","our planet is dying","manual"

If the issue at the heart of our discourse (and it is) is a lack of nuance, details, context, however you want to phrase what I can only call good information then the only thing you're ever going to be able to do is talk to people who are willing to be spoken to one on one and hope you get throught. ""Meaningful Discussion"" is not possible when societies have devolved beyond a certain point. Our capacities for anything of that sort died a long time ago, at least when it comes to talking about the actual roots of our problems. (***Capital, the state's relation to it, the social conditions deriving from the consequences of said relationship and our unwillingness or even support for this socially destructive setup***) The kill em where they stand talk will keep on until an actual outlet for the discontent presents itself. No one with any amount of sense actually thinks your parents are Nazis, they're probably nice people, it's the nice people that trust most easily anyways. But so long as they're plugged in to Hannity, Carlson and that weird British Guy they're still compromised on one level or another. And that's something that does have to be tackled, just not by a firing squad. Maybe a nice talk with the TV off and some nice food.

I don't know what kind of idiots you're dealing with on Facebook, but they're probably not as representative of the country as you think they are. If they were, this thread would reach the front page.

And I'm really trying my hardest to respond in a calm measured way because I, like you, don't want our problems settled in the street  (not when my side would lose anyway). I will grant to you however, that the dehumanization talk is dangerous, not because it's dangerous now but because it's virulent and if it continues to grow then I will have to buy a gun, you will too and everyone will have to board up their windows. Let's hope it doesn't get there.

And just briefly on the Southern Strategy thing. You're not digging deep enough OP, our problems don't start in 1964. America has always had a place for fascism when times aren't good, a place for reactionary politics, it's in our nature. You have to go farther than 60ish years if you want to get to the root of it. I hope this came out well, this is like the third rewrite and I hope I get through.","2018-06-21 06:14:07","0","[deleted]","1747910038.8258061","our planet is dying","manual"

"e0u1eh0","t3_7upo2t","7upo2t","conspiracy","unknown","Would it serve to add to the conversation here regarding my near death experience and take this to another possibility? I became a ""born again"" Christian as the result of a NDE during a horrific auto accident as a teenager. I'm not sure if it would open a proverbial can of worms if I were to state that we are in essence, capable of reaching our higher self, aka ""Christ like"" self as his spirit ascended to the higher 6th dimension. I've read a lot of content that speaks of the uncertainties of our journey After death and I can assure you that I do know for a fact that when we die, it is just a transition to the next stage or level of being as in the spiritual realm. I did not go to the pearly gates for judgement nor were the flames of hell licking at my backside. When I left my body I met a being, who strangely looked familiar at the time. I was very drunk as a 17 year old teen but was suddenly very sober upon leaving my body. Go figure. This being told me; ""It's not your time. You must go back for you have much work to do."" I spent the majority of my life trying to find the meaning in these prophetic words to me from a seemingly familiar man who reminded me of Jesus. I was later told by a spirit called ""Abram"" from an old Mayan shaman who was channeled or ""reached"" by a man who is the medium in FL, that this person was ""my higher self""... I was in a state or shock and yet also recognition of myself, the familiar being, and the completion of the circle of mystery that had surrounded this event during a 100 mph auto accident. I've since discovered that my ""work"" is to help people overcome their fears of death as well as the help enlighten them to the aspects of our spiritual identity as beings who are direct descendants of the ""god source"" and that our true essence will more than likely be debated throughout eternity but that we are in fact eternal beings on a quest to get off the Samsara karma wheel. As we are beings of light and images of ""god's"" likeness, we need to shed the evil and negative aspects of this carnal incarnation and strive to be as pure as we can in order to ascend to the next dimension or levels as they are also known. Jesus was very emphatic about his teaching and all that he said to corroborate the essence of purity as the ""key"" to ""heaven"". in MHO, heaven is a ""state of mind"" and not a destination and ""hell"" as we know it here on earth is the continuous trap of everlasting life in this cursed karmic wheel. As I've actually seen demons on several occasions as well as UFO's, my interpretation is still being analysed and understood... I'm just here working as a ""puzzle assembler"" trying to make sense of it all from what I know from the other side and trying to help people wake up if that makes any sense...","2018-06-17 19:47:35","2","Lonewolf3758","1747910821.4133172","our planet is dying","manual"
