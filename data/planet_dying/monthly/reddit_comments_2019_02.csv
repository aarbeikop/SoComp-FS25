"egvisep","t3_aso6gi","aso6gi","climatechange","action-oriented",">I live in australia, every day getting scarier than the last with storms and heat. I'm only 25, sometimes I sit outside in the incoming storms and cry, because I can feel the roar of this planets last few breaths before it collapses within itself, I love nature and everything in it, I always have. I HATE humans, we've always turned what we touch into ash, my hopes were always in saving the LIFE on this planet, but we're killing the hopes for that too.

&#x200B;

Australia has a population of 24.6 million people.

Exactly how many have died due to these storms and heat waves that you think are going to wipe out life?

We face a challenging future to ensure that increasing numbers of people enjoy a life free of misery and want with issues such as climate change adding to the burden. But this seems to be a million miles from your fears.

For example, depressing song lyrics are not, in any way, a sign of impending extinction. People have been fretting about apocalyptic events for as long as there have been people; that people still fret about such events is evidence of nothing.

If you read up about climate change, and the effects it will have on human society should we choose to do nothing, you will rightly be concerned. However, I don't think there has been a serious, peer-reviewed paper suggesting that anything even close to human extinction will be caused by climate change; furthermore, protecting ourselves from climate change is something that is in our hands, and it appears that there is increasing political will to make the changes necessary.","2019-02-20 18:43:59","6","[deleted]","1747922821.177679","our planet is dying","manual"

&#x200B;

I'm sorry but I went through the same phase you are going through back in October actually. I was having something that I could only describe as panic attacks and severe depression when I first heard about the IPCC report that came out at the time. Nothing you are saying here is new. It's all very, very well-known, well-studied and you just frankly gave a bunch of links to articles from websites like ""Skeptical Science"", ""Glacier Hub"", etc. with the only scientific journal or study you linked to was one by Yale.

&#x200B;

You are way too defeatist and you are writing some long essays to vent your frustrations but what are you actually doing about it? How will this essay change anything? You spewed non-stop statistics and biased information to make everything seem so horrible that it's irreparable. If you did your research, you would find out statistics on how America is rapidly reforesting the continent. Costa Rica is a renewable haven and can run for 300 days of a year with no coal or oil. Scotland, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, etc. are so ahead of the curve in terms of environmental policy and infrastructure it's awe-inspiring. China is surprisingly very forward thinking when it comes to the environment (double edged sword I know but a huge nation with humanitarian issues should be taken with a slight pinch of salt. At least they're trying). You say things like countries are deforesting their countries, but you never acknowledged any of the positives. Do you not see the HUGE shift in public opinion on climate change? Everyone who should be taking it seriously IS taking it seriously. You're going to care about the opinion of skeptics and uneducated individuals? Why? If the scientists and leaders of the world take it seriously which they DO (except for Trump and Bolsonaro), why do you care what the uneducated civilian thinks? They wouldn't notice anything even changed.

&#x200B;

Look into both the negatives and the positives and more importantly, ACT. Join the Citizen's Climate Lobby, become a protestor or activist, set up your own initiative or company, solve problems in your own local community. Don't just copy and paste your essay onto Reddit and hope something in the world will change because of it.","2019-02-04 00:22:28","4","blackgxd187","1747922874.3991199","our planet is dying","manual"
"efpotk1","t3_amttvf","amttvf","environment","emotional","""it doesn’t touch on the idea that humanity emits a multitude of gasses into the atmosphere, many of which trap far more heat than CO2""

Actually, it does: When people talk about CO2, very often they mean ""CO2 equivalents"", where all greenhose gases are considered, and their effect expressed as ""how much CO2 would have the same effect"", because communicating only one figure to point out a problem is easier than publishing a long list.

And, as you mentioned, all (or most of) the other problems are directly or indirectly tied to warming. So let's tackle this one first (which, in itsself, is an enormous task!) and see what other problems remain afterwards.","2019-02-04 07:57:37","1","ebikefolder","1747922874.400785","our planet is dying","manual"

I realized recently that if there's anything I can do, it's communicate to and encourage every single person I can to just search and look for themselves.

If I can't do that (not all situations are appropriate), I just try to make them realize how most of everything that's happening in this world that's wrong starts with belief and the word can't.

I replace that with another one when I share my beliefs.

Belief that things can change

Belief that my children can live a bright future

Belief that this earth can be saved

Belief that human minds can heal

Belief that I can change now, if i so wish



I also believe that if others choose to replace the word can't by can and choose wisely what they believe in, things will be alright.

EDIT: Insight from another post...

I project a movie in my head with my idea as a story, my mind as a projector, emotions as music, and my mouth and body as a screen.

What I project to the world is of my own creation, not the contrary. Meaning that it's not the world that shapes itself, it's the collective of projections that does.

That's when I realize I can shape the world if I so wish, any way I want to.

This is called the panspermia theory, scientists don't know if it's true but it is perfectly possible that it is.

Just to clarify, we have absolutely no idea how life started on earth, and anyone who claims they know with absolute certainty is either ignorant or lying.


> and more so since our distance from the Sun is a perfect sweet spot for life to occur, we just made it.


Yeah we live in what is referred to as the habitable zone, otherwise known as the ""Goldilocks zone"", because it's just right for life to exist.

We think this primarily because as far as we know, the one key ingredient for life is the presence of liquid water. Which is why the earth is so good because we just so happen to live in a place where liquid water is abundant. 

> I wanted to know is if it's possible for life to occur at different distances from different stars

Theoretically it absolutely is. So long as there's liquid water life should be able to thrive. On one of the moons of Jupiter, Europa, scientists believe that there could be a vast sea of liquid water several miles beneath the ice on the surface, and as such they believe it is one of the leading  candidates for alien life in our solar system.

Now there is a caveat with this line of thinking, in that it shows our unavoidable cultural bias. Since we only know of life that needs liquid water to survive, we spend our resources searching for liquid water in the cosmos. However as far as I'm aware there is no reason why alien life couldn't harness some other form of liquid.

>  because knowingly every planet is different such that if said meteor/asteroid would hit it and bring life with it, does that mean because it's not a set distance as we are from our Sun to said planet and its Star then life would die?

As with many of these big questions, we simply don't know.

As far as we know there is only one type of life and that is life that uses DNA as building blocks. But that's not to say that some alien life can't evolve without DNA, and as such is able to survive in situations that we would find abhorrent.
