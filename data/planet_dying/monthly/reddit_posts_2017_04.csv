"65aei4","environment","emotional","What’s the Big Deal about Trees?","I want to show you why trees are such an important part of restoring the planet.  Perhaps we don’t appreciate the value of trees and what they do for us.  I’m going to show you how we can repair the planet virtually by planting trees.  It might seem like it is too simple a solution, but in my blogs I’m going to show you the immense value that trees provide for our planet.

It is my conviction that all of us have a vested interest in the survival of the planet, either because we now have children, and although the subject may not have been in the forefront of our thoughts before we had children, after having children, the survival of the planet definitely becomes more important to life and livingness; because if the planet isn’t going to survive or support life, why even bring young innocent children into the world at all?  Or perhaps we just don’t want to die earlier than we need to, or possibly we have friends and relatives that we don’t want to die.  Or maybe we want earth to continue a while longer.

In my blog, I am going to take up different aspects of things I feel are important to repair the planet.   Sometimes when people talk about restoring the planet they talk about recycling.  And since the subject is familiar territory, I’m going to take up this topic of recycling as the entry-point of this blog, but I plan to take up a lot of other issues that we can expand upon because repairing the planet goes a lot further than just recycling.

What's the Point of Recycling?

One concern which I think is pretty basic for everyone, is how important is recycling after all?  Recycling is the returning of basic components taken from the earth to be used again, or to be returned or given back into the earth.  Now one could think that a garbage dump is effectively the returning of materials back to the earth, but “recycling” should entail the returning of materials to a reusable state.  So “hiding something under the dirt” is not always really recycling.

I have seen the looks on people’s faces when I suggest recycling.  Sometimes I see a look that conveys something along the line of what is the point?  Just send it to the dumpster and it can be turned into a golf course!  Well, I’m going to be getting into that more in later blogs.  I'm really glad that so many cities have gotten on the bandwagon to make it easier for everyone to recycle by collecting recyclable trash as separate from garbage.  An important topic for me is the recycling of paper and the saving of trees.  I guess the object of most recycling is saving.   More about that in a later blog.

Let’s Start With Paper

Right now, I want to talk about the subject of paper.  When I was thinking about why I believe so strongly about recycling, the first thing I thought of was paper.  First of all, paper of course comes from trees, (usually).   Now, just for making paper in the United States, 110 million trees have to be sacrificed each year (some estimates are double that).  So recycling paper can replace part of that million-plus trees each year.

And why I feel so strongly about restoring trees, comes, I guess, from my childhood.  I was raised in Nebraska, and as one of the flattest of the Plains States, Nebraska can be pretty relentless; pertaining to the weather; because there is very little to break the wind.  In the early days, when the Plains were even bleaker than they are today; since there were less trees to provide shade and cool the air.  The hot summer sun just beat down and baked everything it touched.  My ancestors arrived in Nebraska from Scandinavia in the 1800's.   At that time, Nebraska was (And actually to a great degree, it is still even now) mainly just fields with no mountains, no big lakes, and mostly just plains with wind and very hot, and rather extreme cold weather.

But as more people continued to come to Nebraska, towns were built up like: Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island and Nebraska City.  People built homes, and planted trees around their houses and pretty soon, because of the towns, there were way more trees than before.   And because of planting so many trees, the weather patterns changed.  The trees, I was told, brought more rain.  Have you ever thought how trees do that?  Or if, indeed, that is even true?

Why Such a Big Deal about Trees?

I’ll take that up in my next blog.  Right now, I want to delve a bit more into some particularly wonderful things that trees do for us.  A tree generally takes about twenty years to mature.   While it is maturing, it benefits the planet in many ways: from giving fruit, and providing a home to countless animals, to lowering the temperature in hot weather, and providing oxygen for the atmosphere.   A tree also holds the soil together so the earth does not run off into the sea; taking vital nutrients with it.

Statistically, it has been shown that trees can reduce violence.  Areas without trees have greater counts of violence than areas with trees.  Also, it has been shown that people who are ill; heal faster if they have a view of a tree outside their windows.   If a person has a home, trees can increase the property value.  They also provide play and enjoyment for children as well as adults.

You know, trees provide homes for many types of birds.  When someone says that their friend or relative “eats like a bird” that’s actually a misnomer.  In fact, birds eat quite a lot, because flying takes a lot of energy.  Some birds will eat 80 insects per hour or 850 insects per day.  That’s quite a big deal for such tiny bodies.  The fact that birds will eat insects has proven invaluable to farmers when insect plagues have threatened their crops.   But birds, even though they are very valuable, are at risk because they are so tasty.  So in order for the birds to eat all those bugs and protect the farmers’ crops, they must be safe from harm.  Trees provide a safe haven for them; out of reach from many predators; thus allowing them to eat more bugs.

Trees are also one of our most valuable renewable resources.  Trees can be an energy source.  We may not realize how much energy we throw away by not recycling paper.  For instance, the amount of paper, (as well as wood) that we throw away each year, is enough to heat 50 Million homes for twenty years!  Can you believe that! Twenty Years!  So you can see why I think we can make a difference by not wasting our riches.  In addition, by providing shade, a tree conserves energy.  Houses are cooler with a tree shading it; so air conditioning bills are lower.

I hope you like my blog, because I’m writing it for you.  I believe we can restore the planet; because if I didn’t, I wouldn’t bother to write this blog in the first place.  In my next blogs, I’m going to talk about how trees change the weather, and how many trees we have, and how many trees we need and what we could or should do about that.


Bye for now,

Grandmother Earth

It's rarely acknowledged, but we usually view large clusters of deaths as more terrifying or tragic than individual deaths spread out across the world. A mass shooting is the most newsworthy event, but individual gun deaths barely make the local news.

It's clear that what we care about is skewed, not quite aligned with reality. So when it comes to the most dramatic event we can imagine, I think it's worth actually asking why it matters to us if humanity ends.

Our individual deaths are guaranteed even if we figure out how to 'save the planet', so why do we care so much? Is there some comfort in the idea that even after we die, other people will continue living? 

I think most people have this idea that at some point we will leave earth and start roaming the galaxy. At some point the sun is going to swallow earth anyway, so we have to leave eventually.

Otherwise, no one would ever know we existed. I think that's what scares us more than anything. That we evolved, changed a whole planet, created language and stories and art, and then we just stopped existing.

Not only that, but the sun could burn every trace of our history before extraterrestrial archeologists had a chance to find our pyramids, let alone our landfills. Is that what truly scares us?

*****

You blew me away the day I met you. The way you smiled, laughed, talked. The way you looked at me. I never believed in love at first sight, but there was *something* there. At least for me.

The weeks went ahead. You made eye contact with me on every occasion you could. You made up excuses to come and see me. And then invited me over to your place. There was a tension in the air, but nothing happened that day. I was over the moon. Never had I felt such a strong passion for a guy. You were cute, smart, sensitive... Everything a girl could hope for and I had a strong indication that you were into me too. I slept over a few days after that, but still nothing happened. I felt like something was off that night. The whole night you talked about all the relationships you ever had. Literally the whole night. About the ex who cheated on you. The other ex who manipulated you emotionally. The woman of 35 you had a relationship with when you 23.  There was so many, and I felt so tiny with my total of two. So insecure. You called me dude, which I also thought was really weird. It all made me feel like I had somehow made up the feeling of mutual attraction. So we watched some tv under a blanket, and I slept on your couch and you in your bed.

Still, the next day you talked about how nothing happened the other night, even though you tried all your best moves. How you wanted to continue what we stopped under those blankets. I was again ecstatic. My brain wasn't fooling me, I hadn't made it up, you did want to know me better. So I came over again. We had a nice time, and then you brought up how you really, *really*, didn't want to have a relationship. Just casual sex. It felt like someone punched me in the stomach. I couldn't breathe. This feeling would stay with me, every day, over the next few months. It would be there when I woke up. It would be there when I went to sleep. It would be there when I was laughing with my friends. Dragging me down. I vowed to myself to not go through with whatever was going to happen next. You must have seen my doubt, as you asked if I was sure if I wanted to make a move, seeing that casual sex goes from wrong to even more wrong. I didn't know what you meant with that last sentence, but I said yes. A yes that meant 'yes, I know I don't want to do this'. So we again watched some tv under a blanket. You touched my leg, tension was everywhere. And when the movie ended, I asked about that casual sex sentence you mentioned earlier. But you saw this as an invitation and kissed me. It was that exact moment I knew I was lost. That I couldn't pursue you, because it would mean my downfall. And yet, there I was kissing you back. You took me to your bedroom and we had the most amazing sex I've ever had. I didn't even know wasn't supposed to not hurt. It was mindblowing. And I, was completely lost in everything that was you. 

A week later we went to America with a project we both had been working on. I looked forward to it, since I thought it would mean we would spend more time together. You ignored me however most of the time. Flirted with the only other female friend I brought along and who you suddenly took an interest in. Asked her out for drinks while I got sick during our meal together, not even bothering to ask if I was okay. She ended up taking me home, when you went out to get said drinks with other people. It was okay, you weren't mine. Of course it hurt. It hurt a lot but it was okay. Then another day came where you suddenly did have an interest in me. Maybe you were horny, maybe it was because that other friend blew you off. But you grabbed me around my waist, hugged me, asked to sit between your legs during the movie we all watched, threw again a blanket over us. And I, again, was as happy as I could be. It stayed that way until the next day. We were going to go out for food that night, but you weren't there. So I asked. And the others said how you had a date with a girl you knew from a vacation you had there once, and who was super into you. They talked about how you said how amazing that sex was. They talked about how you could one night stands even when you traveled half the globe. I felt so used. Didn't know what to do. I couldn't stand the talking about you, they couldn't shut up about it, but I couldn't leave. And then, the next day, you talked to me personally how great that night went. With a sick smile around your mouth. And I just stood there, pretending to be happy for you while I was dying on the inside. It also was our last night there, so we went out to a club. You danced with me. And I, the stupid little girl completely over her head in love, let you. Let you put your hand around my waist, let you pull me closer, let you kiss me. Not even 24 hours after you had sex with that other girl I didn't even care about that anymore, because it was all better. I had you, and that was everything I needed. Just you. I would forgive you all if it meant that I could have you in my life for just one brief moment.

We got back home. The project ended so it would mean I would never see you again. It didn't faze you. I couldn't stand the thought that I would never see you again. So I asked if I could stay the night with you every other two weeks. You said yes. Of course you said yes. I should have had the strength to stop whatever we were having back then. But I couldn't. I could never do that. All my life has been coloured by my separation anxiety. I can't cut people out of my life, even though it would mean my death. So I went on. Months on end I spent two nights a months with you. Night were we stayed up until 4 AM. Where we talked about life. Where you asked about my issues, what bothered me, how you could help. I don't trust people because of my separation anxiety, but my love for you and your caring made me open up in a way I've never opened up to **anybody** in my whole life. Not one person in the 23 years I have walked this earth know me the way you know me. Never did I trust anybody like I trusted you. I gave you my whole life. And I am to blame. Because I shouldn't have. I should have kept the guards up around me that I had had for 23 years. Guards that have meant my survival for 23 years. I tore them all down for you. 

During those months, you however treated me like shit in any other way. I told you about how I felt used when you invited that other girl over when we were in America and then acted like nothing happened. You said that you didn't feel guilty about that because you had told me that we were just casual sex. And that maybe YOU should feel used by me. I still don't know in what way I could have used you in your eyes, as I was as sincere as could be. All I wanted was to love you, and help you, and be there for you. It made me feel guilty, because that really weren't my intentions and it hurt me that you perceived me that way. So I apologized.  
Then I asked you about a promise you made several weeks earlier about how you would go dancing with me. You told me you didn't want to anymore because I was too boring. I asked why. Too boring because I don't do drugs, don't go out every weekend, and never had a one night stand, you said. And I felt like shit again, and decided I would have to change myself for you to like me. Would go out more. Did drugs with you, although I swore to myself years ago that I would never do drugs. I lost myself, my whole identity, for you. I don't blame you, I shouldn't have let that happen. It IS my fault.   
You once left me waiting outside your door in the middle of winter because you forgot I was coming over. You said it was my fault because I should have called because of just sending a text. I replied I have a severe anxiety of calling. You laughed with it, called it ""what is it with these kids those days, it really isn't that hard, just get over it"". I *wish* I could get over my anxiety. But in reality, it really isn't that simple. You didn't apologize because you left me there waiting for a whole hour because you forgot I would came over. Not even one sorry. 
You talked about how your priorities list of people is filled by you, you, and you in the first three spots. I said it was filled with the names of my friends and family, to which you replied that it would mean I have no self respect and that isn't normal behaviour. 
In general, you still talked a lot about all the other girls you would have sex with at that time. How great their breasts looked. How horny they were when you tied them up. You never apologized for something you did wrong, even though I said how upset it made me. You didn't answer my notes I would leave everytime I spent the night over.  You wouldn't admit mistakes when I pointed them out for you. Not once. 

All those things made me feel like utter shit and my confidence went lower and lower. I felt myself sliding off in depression again. I would sometimes think that you didn't even want to be my friend, that you pretended to like me as some sick, cruel joke. But still, I trusted you. Thought I was being too emotional for reacting in such a way to your remarks. And since you were always so caring, I also told you how I thought I was getting depressed again. You told me that a depressed person should never talk with you. That you had a lot of stress you had to deal with yourself while finishing off your PhD. This made me feel for you. I have a tendency to share other people's emotions and I could feel your stress in the way you were talking about it. So I swore to myself that from that day on, I wouldn't bother you anymore with my personal problems. I would watch the way I talked and behaved so you could be happy. If you were happy, I would be happy too. If I wouldn't talk about my problems, you would never know how bad I felt, and you would still be happy to talk with me. So I kept it all inside me. The suicidal thoughts, the self harm.  As long as you would stay in my life, I knew I would be okay. I depended so much on you. Again, my fault.

Beside your behaviour towards me, my love for you was also a very big burden on me. I knew I would never see it blossom into something more, but I also couldn't walked around with it much longer. It tore me down, made your remarks about all those girls you fucked sting. So when you said you would be leaving again for America soon, now for a year, I told myself this would be the ideal moment to tell you how in love I was with you. It would be awkward, yes, but we wouldn't have to see each other anymore for over a year, and I was convinced we could make it work, since I thought you also cared about me as a friend. Because even though I wanted more, I looked at you in the first place as the best friend I've ever had. The friend who knew all my flaws and whom I could trust completely. So I wrote you a letter, a letter with which I thought all my agony would be over. A letter in which I specifically asked to crush all my hope by saying you didn't share my feelings. A letter which you didn't read for over a week. A week in which my mind was free to wander and tear itself down even more than it already was. A week where my decent into madness was finally completed and depression had finally had me back again in his claws. Then the day came when you read it, a few days before you would leave. And you said 'thanks'. That was it. A simple thank you. I was confused, asked I you wanted to talk about it some more. You said that you didn't know what was more to say. So I again asked that I really needed for you to say you didn't share those feelings, but you just ignored my request. You then promptly told me about a go away party you would hold in your apartment. My hopes went up again, that you would probably invite me seeing as you said it was for all your friends. You didn't. The whole night that party went on, you sent me pictures on how you guys were having such a good time, while I sat alone at home. I thought you meant it well back then, that you wanted to share the joy I was missing. 

You left for America. I sent you some messages, which you replied to at first but then started ignoring when you landed. I tried to think nothing of it, thinking you were just busy. However, my depressed mind would come up with other excuses. How I wasn't good enough for you, that this was your plan all along: dump me now that you were across the other side of the ocean and you wouldn't have to deal with me anymore, that my thoughts on how you pretended to like me were right. After some days, you replied again. Since I thought that I had those negative thoughts because of my love for you, I again asked you to crush my hope for you ever having feelings for me. You ignored me again.   
And then that fateful day came.

I had my period that week. Nothing special really, wouldn't it have been for the fact that I noticed my depression gets a lot worse when I have it. Like full blown panic attacks that I can't get under control whenever something goes wrong. Something happened with a friend one night during that week, he went berserk on me and started throwing things, yelling at me. I fled into his bathroom and locked the door. I was completely in panic, didn't know who to turn to. And there you were, the friend to whom I opened up myself completely and who I trusted with whole my heart. The friend who I shielded from all my dark thoughts for weeks on end. The friend who I thought would eventually understand the storm that was raging inside me. I told about what happened, you were concerned, and said I had to leave there immediately. And then, you brought up my request of crushing the hope of my feelings for you. I don't know why, because that couldn't have been a badder moment. But I went with it, as I thought it would be my last chance to finally hear it from you. I thought I could take it, I was feeling already bad at the moment and I thought it was maybe even better to bring it up know, so that a day where I might have felt better wouldn't have been ruined. You said you would never have feelings for me, and I felt finally relieved. It hurt, but I finally had peace with at least that part of my burdens. I thanked you for it, because I know it wasn't easy for you to say. You even said sorry after it, the first time ever in all those months I've ever heard you say that. And you know damn well how good I am at remember conversations.   
But then, you said something that hurt me to my core. You said to please stop treating you as my personal therapist. My mind went blank, all became black before my eyes, my ears started ringing. I trusted you. I shielded you from all my dark thoughts, my suicidal thoughts, my self harm, my stress, *everything*. The issues that I did tell you about, *you* asked *me*. *You* asked *me* to open up, and now I was the one to blame? Before I could even bring my mind together, you proceeded to tell me you didn't want to hear from me again. At least not for a while, so I could get over my love for you. Still blown away by your previous comment, I agreed. *I fucking agreed*. I, the one with separation anxiety, who *knows* how much she can't handle not talking to people who she cares about, agreed. And this is the exact moment I broke. The exact moment depression tore me down into its abyss. The moment I stopped having feelings. No joy, no happiness, no sadness, no enthusiasm, just numbness. My whole me broke down. Feelings came pouring out of my mouth, a word stream I couldn't stop, a panic attack I had no control over anymore. It didn't stop for two days, and you didn't respond to any of my messages during it. I felt so ashamed. All those months, I shielded you from all my stress, and now in one night I tore down all my hard work because I was not strong enough to keep everything inside me. I apologized profusely. You ignored it. I apologized again. You ignored it again. You didn't say anything for six days, and all I could feel was dread. Dread, and guilt and shame. Eventually, you answered. It wasn't empathic, or thoughtful, or anything. You called me crazy and said you really needed to have that space between us. Me, still trusting you completely, ignored your first comment although it hurt like hell. I responded to the second by saying that it wouldn't work for me, so I asked if I could still message you from time to time. You agreed with that, and I made a mental note to only message you once a week and only about the cheerful things that happened to me. I apologized again, and you said it was okay. So I thought it was okay between us, that this was just a rough patch in our friendship, but we would become stronger friends because of this. We didn't.

I messaged you, and you were very short in your reply. I thought you were still ruffled by my previous behaviour so I thought I would just give you same time. I messaged you again after a week. You ignored it. Then by then I had a feeling that it really wasn't okay like you said, I decided to tell you about my then already diagnosed depression. So you could understand why I behaved the way I did, and that I really wasn't crazy but that I was just in a bad place in my mind right now. You just said 'k'. I apologized again, and you again told me it was okay. It wasn't.  
I again starting messaging you, talking about good things that happened in my life and you ignored me. This went on three weeks and then I broke. You have no fucking idea how much being ignored hurts. Not even one clue. It makes you feel worth less than garbage. Like some bug that needs to be destroyed as soon as possible. I begged you to please not ignore me, as it hurt me so much. You ignored my pleas. I stopped messaging you, but I got worse after that. My confidence was a all time low, my mind convinced me how worthless I was, that nobody cared about me. One night, I couldn't take it anymore. I wrote all my suicide notes. Handwritten for my friends who were still in my home country, digitally for you. Yours was the only one I sent as the others were meant to be found next to my body. Yours would never reach destination, not in time. So I sent it to you that night. It was an explanation on how sorry I was for the things I put you through, how great of a human being you were to me, that my suicide was not my fault. Then I took some pills. I however should have known that my gag reflex has a mind on its own. I couldn't even swallow four pills during on hour. I felt like such a fucking mistake. I wanted to die, I was so ready die, to embrace death where I was always so scared off because it seemed like the only possible solution to my problems, and I couldn't. I couldn't even swallow some pills. I felt like a weak human being. But worst of all, *I sent that message to you*. I tried again the next day. I swallowed more then, but threw them back up. I failed again. I sat there trembling, I couldn't tell you how I was still alive, how fucking pathetic would that be. But eventually, after much thinking on my part, I couldn't send you off in your life thinking I was dead. So I texted you. And you had no clue what was going one. You hadn't read my suicide note, you didn't even open the message as a message from me would imply an immediate ignore. You also have no idea how this felt. I was already so low, failing at my suicide, and now I wasn't even worth 5 minutes of your time in what was supposed to be my last moments on earth. I was literally worth nothing to you.  I again told you how much your ignoring me hurt and I asked to talk about what happened. You ignored it again. I then asked for the last time to please talk to me, because I wanted to explain it all, that I was not crazy like you thought. And then you finally replied. I don't exactly what you said, but you made it sound like you wanted to talk. And for the first time in months, I felt relieved again, because I thought it meant that you finally understood how deep I was in my depression. I said how grateful I was that you know finally talked to me and that I would come back later to talk, as I was not feeling well that day. You said 'ok :)' and then, you blocked me. Accidentally, I was at a friend's house the moment I found out. I broke down. Not just a panic attack, or an emotional break down where words would came pouring out of my mouth. Oh no. It was far worse. My friend has to physically restrain or I would have slit my wrists there and then. He had to call 911. 

After a few days of good care, I calmed down again and bypassed your block by using my dad's phone, because I really needed that talk in order for me to be happy again. That talk was for me to forgive myself, because I couldn't forgive myself for my behaviour during all those weeks if I never apologized profusely for it to you. You were completely mad, but you did listen. After I was done talking, you called me selfish. Selfish because of my attempted suicide. Selfish because according to you, I sent that message while chilling in my room. Selfish because I didn't stop to think what the effect would be on **YOU**. I felt so bad, I agreed with you, calling myself a selfish person. But I didn't apologize for that suicide note. I still stand by it. It wasn't send 'all chill'. I cried the whole time. You don't know what it is like to embrace death, a thing you fear so much, because even that thought is better than spending a lifetime in the agony that is depression. You don't know what it is so sit there in the middle of the night with a bottle of pills in your hand thinking how you are worth nothing. I DID think of you. I know what suicide does to people, it was not a light-hearted choice I made. I KNOW how guilty it makes people feel. That's why I wrote that fucking suicide note in the first place. If you would have read it, you would have seen how many times I repeated that you were not to blame for my suicide and is wasn't your fault. That no action of you could have prevented this.   
I asked you to unblock me, because I couldn't live with the fact that you casted me off for good. I wouldn't contact you, since your ignoring caused to much harm in my head and I didn't see you as a good friend anymore. You didn't want to. I explained the importance of it, that I wouldn't contact you, that it was just a simple click on your end but something that I could would speed up my healing process. You still refused.  
You also said  that normal people don't ask other people about their feelings for them. It was again a blow to the stomach. I thought your reaction of 'thank you' was really weird, because I myself think that you should be clear with people all times about your intentions. I told you this. And you said how I forced you to hurt me by asking that clarification of you, and that normal people don't like hurting other people.   
During that whole conversation, you asked multiple times if it was over yet. I explained the importance of it to you, yet you didn't have the patience to wait on for it. Eventually, you just said you had it and blocked me again. It was the last I ever heard of you, and I left me with an enormous guilt for the way I treated you.
*****

That is now three months ago. My panic attacks only got more frequent, and literally *every night* I end up having a nightmare. Mostly it is about you, how you come to me to mend things again, only to leave me again, all while smiling when doing this. Sometimes it is about other people leaving me, sometimes it is about me dying. My mom is buying me a dog after years of nagging because she hopes it will make me better again. Therapy isn't working. My separation anxiety has only got worse after you left. So am I better off?   
Yes, definitely. Because I don't have you anymore dragging me down. It hurts, missing you. It still hurts so much. It wounds me to my core. But I can now finally see you as who you truly were all those time. And I still want to tell you a few things. 

You have a gigantic ego, and your selfishness is off the charts. You act like your ex cheating on you doesn't hurt you anymore, but I *know* it does. Constantly talking about that gives it away. I'm really sorry that happened, but you had a part to play in that as well. People don't cheat in a healthy relationship, there has to be something wrong on either end. And while her coping mechanism was really not justified at all, there was a lesson to be learned there about yourself too. The world doesn't revolve around you. Other people have feelings as well, and you don't get to decide you didn't hurt them when they tell you you did. Bottling up all your feelings isn't healthy. It is a time bomb that is surely going to explode. Maybe in a year, maybe in forty years, but it *will* explode. Feeling things doesn't make you weak, you have to be strong to survive the waves that come crashing over you from time to time. Learn how to say sorry, because you have a responsibility for things going wrong too. Admitting you're wrong isn't admitting defeat. It's simply showing your respect for the other. You still do that negging thing. It may be unconsciously done, but all those months, the only thing you did was look down on me and make subtle comments that would tear away at my self-esteem. I also know how insecure *you* are. You hide it well, behind all your walls, but these walls have cracks. I know how afraid you are of ending up alone. I'm sure you will find a women who you are madly in love with and who is madly in love with you, but one day, she is going to see through all this shit. You may treat her better than you did with me, but your egoism and inability to say sorry is going to kill even that relationship one day. Love doesn't forgive all. I pity you. You're digging your own grave, and you don't even know it yet. 

I'm not saying these things to hurt you. After all you put me through, I still think you are a good person and I know there is good in you. I'm telling you these things because eventually, you will end up hurting yourself. And I still care about you enough to not want that for you, because like every other person on this planet, you deserve your own happiness.

I truly hope you come to see one day that you can't go through life with disrespecting others so much. In the meantime, I will always be here. I won't forget what you put me through, but even when your life may get dark, know that you can always count on me to lean on. Because I never, *ever*, want somebody to go through everything I experienced on his own. Not even someone who disrespected me so badly as you. I really hope that day never comes, for your sake. 

Please don't do this to somebody ever again,

"65isy6","vegan","unknown","Question for vegans about ethical reasoning","Hello, I have been following this subreddit a little while, and have found a lot of useful ideas and info :)  I have recently decided to adopt a vegan (or mostly vegan) diet, although I am transitioning to it gradually - eg. trying to have more and more meatless days, making different choices in restaurants.  I am running into some challenges, but that isn't what I wanted to ask about (maybe I'll do that in another post).  

My question for vegans has to do with the ethics driving it.  Ethical /moral issues are the main reason I think veganism is the right way to go.  I see 4 main reasons for becoming vegan, for myself, 1 related to health and 3 related to ethics.  The health reason has to do with all the studies I keep seeing (eg. Colin Campbell, Esseylstein, Dean Ornish) about the benefits of a plant-based diet, and of course all the data on the harm of eating the 'standard American diet' full of meat, cheese, sugar, etc.  The ethical reasons, to me, are: the suffering of animals (how they are treated, especially in factory farming), the environment (movie Cowspiracy greatly affected me), and the reality of how many humans go hungry daily while in first world countries we use up a ton of resources, land, etc to indulge our desire for meat.

So here is my question.  If animal suffering and mistreatment of animals drives veganism, and since humans are animals too, should we not be more (or at least equally) concerned about human suffering?  I am sure many vegans are concerned about stopping war, child labour, etc.  But for the most part, I don't find concern about human suffering coming up in any veganism discussion.  Of the over 7 billion humans on this planet, how many can't get enough food to eat, and go hungry daily?  (from what I've read, it maybe as much as half the world's population)  How many humans die or suffer due to inadequate health care, lack of clean drinking water, and many other basic things that most people reading this take for granted?  I'm not saying vegans aren't concerned about such things, and in fact I would assume most vegans care more about it than the average carnivore.  But I hardly ever hear it brought up in any articles or discussions about veganism.  I see photos of penned in cows, of mutilated corpses of various animals, etc.  But what about how horribly we are treating our fellow human beings?   I realize adopting a vegan diet will likely indirectly help other humans around the globe, for many reasons.  And I know that 'veganism' is mainly about what we eat, as opposed to geopolitical concerns.  I'm not sure if I am getting my question across coherently, but I am trying to express something that has been bothering me: an intense focus of vegans on all animals, that seems to exclude one species (homo sapiens). I hope this doesn't trigger a lot of defensiveness; I find a lot of thoughtful posts on this subreddit, so I was hoping to hear people's thoughts about this :)","2017-04-15 12:17:43","32","33","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/65isy6/question_for_vegans_about_ethical_reasoning/","True","GadgetNeil","1747883844.355853","our planet is dying","manual"
"657zjn","futurology","unknown","Yes, our jobs are useless; however UBI is not the answer.","In response to the popularity of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/654kt1/a_growing_number_of_people_think_their_job_is/) regarding the astounding percentage of people beginning to understand the uselessness of their employment, I am compelled to argue against the popular ideological silver-bullet thought to solve the inevitable challenges caused by automation: Universal Basic Income.

Increased automation is the fruit harvested over generations of human labor and ingenuity, and a natural blessing of technological progress. UBI, and a fiat financial capitalist economy altogether, are unnatural constructs and artificial institutions that we have created to facilitate markets and allocate resources (albeit inefficiently). The issue lies in the fact that Modern Monetary Theory, Keynesian economics, the infinite growth paradigm and profit maximization have warped the very definition of **economy**, or specifically *economization*.

""Waste not, want not"" is the wholly ignored golden rule of socioeconomics. The definition of 'economize' is as follows: To practice economy, as by **avoiding waste** or **reducing expenditures**.

Think about this for a minute in the context how our world leaders and academia currently define economic success... GDP, inflation, spending, production. It is entirely backwards. Economization is the *reduction of expenditures* and *elimination of waste*, yet we're only happy with our economic data when we create jobs that waste people's time, waste money and resources creating wasteful products that people don't need, waste talent and attention on problems we're created for ourselves, print more money to be wasted on solutions that don't' solve the root problem in the first place, and leave piles of waste to ruin our environment and climate. We call this **economic growth**. GDP is a measure of our collective waste, not created value, and if we're still spending money to solve a problem, **we haven't solved it**. A valuable example is the [Planned Obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) phenomenon whereas a light bulb manufacturer creates a light bulb that last forever, effectively putting itself out of business for lack of repeat customers. Businesses are incentivized to create less efficient products to generate sustained profits, and in the infinite growth paradigm, if you aren't growing, you're dying. This is the very antithesis of economy, and when large stakeholders in industries or countries are in dire straits due to the contradictory nature of our economic system, we bail it out in one way or another. Waste, creating waste, forcing a solution that creates more waste in the future.

This is the basic essence of UBI: nothing changes on a wholesale level. The planet is still bound to the perils of artificial monetary policy, the hidden tax of inflation, money suppliers maintaining control of the economy and greater concentration of wealth & power. Sure we may be able to stem inflation by paying for UBI with overhauling the tax code, health care, social security and welfare, though in the end the public is left dependent on a monthly allowance that no matter how hard we try, in relation to costs *will never be enough to live comfortably*. We'll always argue for a higher allowance, and the fiat currency provided will always inflate prices higher, and the struggle continues into a dystopian society locked in a fiat economical wasteland under a small group of corporate oligarchs.

In true economic theory, a business should strive to put itself out of business, or to improve upon providing your goods or services so efficiently over time that you no longer need to. The time given back to us through automation accomplishing tasks humans otherwise would have been forced to do manually is a economical blessing, and an indication that we're approaching a post-scarcity society.

UBI is a dangerous philosophical roadblock that prevents society from progressing the thought paradigm beyond asking if income, or money itself is even necessary. If the majority of public necessities are met through automation, the economy should be redesigned as a resource based system rather than supply side fiat financial capitalism where society is still bound to the limits of what they can buy with their artificial income. Post-scarcity economics shatters the paradigm altogether, on a political, business, and individual level, where we require a whole new way of organizing ourselves to peacefully transition through the automation age. UBI is not the answer, only a continuation of the same old problem we currently face.","2017-04-13 20:13:34","8","59","0.56","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/657zjn/yes_our_jobs_are_useless_however_ubi_is_not_the/","True","the_buddhaverse","1747883950.950742","our planet is dying","manual"
"66rspb","futurology","unknown","Our species should have a portfolio strategy.","Placing all of humanity's resources in a single stock - one planet, one culture, one genome - makes us too susceptible to shocks. Any trait remains within the evolutionary tree only because it manifests in multiple mutated branches - and then, when some branches die, others carry the trait on. 

The trait we should seek to preserve is human consciousness. The branches we should use to transmit it are whichever ones are humane and practical to create. This means, most obviously, space colonization - diversifying where we live. Less obviously, I think it means cultivating alternative visions of human life - diversifying who we are.

Let's get specific. A vocal and talented minority of our society believes mankind's destiny will be fulfilled only if it continues to maximize its intellect and power, through artificial genetic selection or artificial mechanical intelligence. An overwhelming but passive majority assumes mankind's destiny is plenty fulfilled already, thank you very much, and does not require such novelties.

Both groups should be allowed to test their hypotheses, eventually in separate communities on separate planets. This could yield two utterly distinct humanities incapable even of mutual understanding. It could also yield one humanity and one mass extinction. It could also yield two humanities that prove to be one humanity, not so very different after all. It could also yield two mass extinctions.

This is better than what we're doing now - watching idly while powerful and unconstrained tools of human empowerment begin to transform the species according to random quirks of privilege and access. Space colonization programs have (barely) begun; they should continue. They should be joined by an honest debate about what kind of humans are doing the colonizing.","2017-04-21 20:27:03","4","2","0.62","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/66rspb/our_species_should_have_a_portfolio_strategy/","True","CollectiveShrug","1747883983.547411","our planet is dying","manual"
"68i54i","conspiracy","unknown","It is time you know the truth.","September 23, 2017.

Unite as one species or perish....just as many human civilizations prior to ours have done so when they came to close to knowing the truth.

Light vs. Dark.

Stop thinking in terms of nation-states, borders, races, ethnicities, etc.

[The Light....and how it should be lived in actions....is described in an easily understandable way in both the New Testament and the Quran.](https://youtu.be/gtM8BRF7Bd0)

Disregard those parts of the NT and the Quran which make you then dismiss the entireity of the text.

The Spirit of the Scriptures is what matters.

Religion is a man made construct which institutionalizes that which was never meant to be institutionalized.

If you come to know the Spirit of each scripture, you will come to know Truth.

Christ was an extraterrestrial who allowed part of his consciousness to be born into a human form. When he ""spoke with God the Father"", his human consciousness was in tune with his higher consciousness. He did not talk to God in the way all of us imagine it.

One day, Christ's consciousness ""woke up"" and prompted him to start questioning Judaism as taught by the Scribes and the Pharisees and the accompanying societal structure which dictated that ONLY the Scribes and the Pharisees were authorized to speak to the Law of God....with everyone else relegated to trusting the with blind faith or be relegated to punishment.

Christ's mission to Earth was to show humanity that living in commune with The Light would allow their consciousness to ""activate"" and be granted the Wisdom long kept from them.

""God"" is the Light...a universal force which gave life to all living things, thus making the very nature of all living things that of the Light...the universal force which we call God.

The ""Godhead"" of the Trinity is this force. Christ was ""the only Son of God""....but Son is a human term...and it was never said that Christ was to be the only Son for time eternal.

Christ was the first human of this cycle of humanity to have his consciousness ""activated"" with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is that which allows your consciousness to commune with the Force of you live in tune and harmony with the Light....living as nature created you.

Christ was a Prophet...but his words were misinterpreted and the Apostles did not fully comprehend that The Word was to be lived, not institutionalized as a game of Simon Says called religion.

Christ chastised the Scribes and the Pharisees for knowing how to ""enter Heaven"", yet not entering themselves and keeping the secret from the Jews.

The Scribes and the Pharisees were also extraterrestrials and much of the pre-Christ Judaic laws were carryovers from the time of Hamarabe and the Ancient Babylonians and Ancient Assyrians.

These many laws, which required one to be highly educated for a time when the vast majority couldn't read, were a way to keep humanity confused and blindly obedient to a system they were tricked into thinking would lead to their damnation if they did otherwise.

The Scribes and the Pharisees were 3rd dimensional human servants to an extraterrestrial race as well....the Draco Reptilians. The Scribes and Pharisees even say that they serve their satanic gods, Baal and Moloch...the gods of human sacrifice.

The actual Draco Reptilians had ""demons"" living in the 4th Dimension...and these ""demons"" were those who controlled the Scribes and the Pharisees. Conversely, ""Angels"" existed in the 4th Dimension as well and watched over Christ as he attempted to Free this planet from the grips of the Draco Reptilians, their soldiers (the Demons) hiding just out of sight on this planet in the 4th Dimension, and their human subjects who were either themselves possessed or hybrids meant to serve the Darkness.

Early Christians, in a world where the polytheistic Roman Empire still ruled and the Scribes and Pharisees still controlled ancient Israel, were considered a cult and were persecuted as a result.

Eventually they found refuge in a Roman Emperor converted in battle, the Council of Nicea was convened, and the Catholic Church was established.

But when Christ said ""upon this rock you shall build my Church"", it was misinterpreted as building an actual institution. The truth of the message was that Earth....""the rock""...was to become a planet rescued and redeemed from the forces which Rebelled against the inherent nature of all living things...the Light...and became ""the Fallen"" who sought to rule as Gods themselves over humanity.

This was a part of a long war which raged...and continues to rage...in our solar system and galaxy between Light and Dark.

If you think what I am saying sounds very much like ""The Force"" of Star Wars and like Star Wars itself...it does and...yes...that is actually the truth. Whether Lucas was divinely inspired through a reactivated consciousness or was leaked this information, I do not know. Regardless, the films are actually a quite accurate representation of the nature of the universe and a modern interpretation of The Trinity.

Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, in psychic experiments he conducted while in space, confirmed the existence of the Fourth Dimension (and which the CIA corroborated through many studies of its own) and then questioned whether or not all humans could tap into it via consciousness (the Pineal Gland...""Third Eye""...being where the ""Holy Spirit"" awakens to allow humans to tap into the Light of the 4th Dimension) or if it was only limited to certain humans.

This I cannot answer, as I do not have the answer. But I can tell you that I have tapped into this 4th Dimension and it is why I am telling you all of this. I will explain more at the end.

The Illuminati are those humans who are tapped into this consciousness as well, but use it to serve the Dark spirits of the 4th Dimension and the physical ETI race (Draco Reptilians...maybe others) which sit at the top.

Free Masonry...whether started with good intentions or bad intentions...became an institution whereby these secrets were revealed and, over time, has created appendant societies such as Skull & Bones.

The 4th Dimensional entities of Darkness are able to remain hidden and in control by causing chaos, strife, confusion, heartache, death, violence, etc. among humanity

Over time, religion became the means by which they tricked humanity into surrendering its Free Will.

Christ is not a physical being who will return.

(***Disregard the above statement.*** It is far too definitive regardless of what I've received from first hand sources and documents which claim Christ was either actually a physical human like, benevolent ETI who came to Earth or a man who channeled a higher consciousness. My biggest point is that humanity needs to start focusing on the Spirit of Scriptures and just get away from the man made institution of that which was never to be an institution.)

Christ returns when all of humanity unites under the principles of nature...the Light...and stops feeding these intermediary 4th Dimension forces of darkness.

The idea of ""The Second Coming"" as taught and currently understood is a trick to make humanity surrender its Free Will and surrender creation of their reality to a false belief intentionally created by Darkness in a twisting of the original teaching's intent and lesson.

This is where Mohammad comes in.

Mohammad...despite everything humanity has been taught....was a Prophet just like Christ. The Quran calls Christ ""Isa"" and reveres him as the most important prophet and revers Mary, his mother, in the same manner as Catholicism. 

Christ was the ""Lamb""...the one given up for humanity and Earth in an attempt to liberate this planet and its inhabitants from control by the ETIs (Draco Reptilians and probably others), their 4th dimensional warriors, and their human servants who have long controlled the planet and driven humanity...in this cycle...away from discovering its true nature in an era where you are advanced enough to know, understand and comprehend the true nature of that which you call God/Allah. 

Thus, while Islam was not meant to be an institutional religion just as Christianity was not meant to be, its name is worth examining. 

Isa = Christ

Lamb = The Sacrifice of Isa

Isalamb = Islam

Mohammad was sent to in order to set in stone those teachings of Christ / Isa which had been correctly interpreted and to offer clarification of those which had either been misinterpreted or intentionally twisted by servants of The Fallen. 

While Mohammad specifically stated that Islam was not to divide off into different sects, man is flawed and fallible. Thus, his words were not heeded. However, since reality must be dealt with even when the reality goes against that which was taught, it is worth examining the two main sects of Islam. 

Shiia Islam only calls for Jihad as a means of defense when first attacked. It allows for song and dance. While it has definitely taken a hardline interpretation regarding women, as all of Islam has, its interpretation is far better than that of Sunni Islam and...were it to meet sincerely practiced Christianity halfway...the role of women would be accurately understood. 

Western culture's modern idea of ""feminism"" as ""equality"" is a twisting by forces of darkness. Women have equality under western laws, yet women who decry what ""the patriarchy"" has done now seek to emulate those very men whom they blame for the world's woes. They then seek to obtain power...thinking that somehow a female emulation of those they blame will result in a different outcome. 

See how Darkness is so good at getting you to believe it is Light?

Modesty, among both men and women, is a necessity to live within the Light so that humanity is not constantly focused on the physical and material. It is so that you will judge your fellow human....be they male or female...on their character and actions as opposed to religion, skin color, wealth, language, nationality, etc. 

Of course, the need for female equality only came about because males failed to adhere to this core tenet of balance...knowing the role of each sex so as to live in balance and harmony with nature and each sex treating eachother with the utmost of love and respect. Straying from that causes one to dominate the other, domination causes resentment, so on and so forth, and you end up where you are today. But I digress...

Shia Islam, although there were never supposed to be sects, is the closest thing to Mohammad's validation of Christ/Isa's message as interpreted by humanity and Mohammad's correction of that which needed to be corrected. 

Shia Islam brought the concept of Tawidh....that God/Allah is just the name given as a personification for that from which all living things derive....the Universal Force of Light. 

The Universal Force of Light which created you also gave you Free Will...and it was your job to exert your Free Will in accordance with the Light so that humanity could one day be of a state in both knowledge and wisdom to liberate itself and join the larger community of its galactic brothers ans sisters of different species who live with the Light. 

Christ said that after 1,000 years, The Beast was to be loosened from its shackles. This occurred in the 1560s with the Celestial Event of Nuremberg. 

This was ""The Battle of Heaven and Hell"" and this was when ""The Fallen"" returned to Earth and were made to test humanity in order to see how far it had progressed and whether that progression resulted in the messages being correctly interpreted and lived. 

John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" was correct in its assertion that the Battle had occured. 

Everything since then has been a test of humanity to see if you could strike the balance of knowledge and wisdom as you entered an era in which knowledge would advance....especially from the 1800s onward...and challenge you with the temptation that your knowledge  should supplant wisdom and that you yourselves could be ""God"" and try to solve your problems with what is, in the grand scheme of things, knowledge self derived by a species that, currently, is akin to child running around with a loaded gun. 

Your Whore of Babylon....that woman who is not a woman....that woman who serves the Darkness (the 4th Dimension and the Draco)...is Queen Elizabeth. She was also Queen Victoria.

Queen Elizabeth is a Draco Reptilian...as are all members of the House of Windsor...and they sit in that city which quietly rules all of the world: 

London. More specifically, the City of London (separate from actual London)...that place from where all the world's finances....your current God called Money...are controlled. 

The warning given by General Cornwallis to General Washington, as detailed in ""Legions of Satan"" from 1781, is a historical truth. 

The Dark Bloodlines all tie back to the Draco and Queen Elizabeth is the head. 

The Royal Family assisted The Rothschilds in the creation of Israel via the Balfour Declaration in order to corrupt and coopt Judaism, by turning Zionism into Judaism, with the creation of a homeland for the Israelites....in direct defiance of their covenant with God. 

Israel is run by a secular government and many of its top military and political leaders since the 1980s are former KGB assets....as the USSR was secretly controlled by Zionists. 

When the Cold War needed to end, the false securities George H.W. Bush and others created to the tune of $240 billion from 9/10/91 to 9/13/91 with a ten year maturity were used to bankrupt the Soviet Union. 

Thos securities were due to reach their maturation on 9/13/01....hence 9/11, CIA involvement, Mossad involvement, and Saudi Arabian involvement.

Oh yeah...Saudi Arabia! How could I forget them?! The House of Saud are Zionists masking as Arab Muslims. Great Britain created fundamentalist Wahhabi Sunni Islam in the 1700s. Great Britain also created a Zionist outpost in Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire) with the Young Turk revolution of Mustafa Kemal Attaturk. There is actually a memo between one British Foreign Minister to another, in the era, detailing that this was the true nature of the Young Turk movement. It was ""Middle Eastern Free Masonry acting on behalf of Zionism"". 

The War of 1812 was a scripted war in order to burn down Washington, D.C., embed British Spies who would then go on to be multigenerational families of wealth and power in the United States, and have Washington, D.C. rebuilt as one of the Whore of Babylon's 7 flags on 7 continents....hence why D.C. is built as a symbolic homage to Zionism / Babylonian Talmudism. For that is what Zionism...which claims to be Judaism...actually is: 

Babylonian Talmudism. 

The worship and service of Darkness by which men and women are recruited with promises of tremendous wealth and power...but who unknowingly have been walking humanity in this cycle to its death and destruction. 

The Civil War was an attempt to break apart the United States by European monarchies, lead by the British Royal Family, supporting the southern aristocracy who remained loyal to the British in The Revolution. The vast majority of southerners were Scot-Irish, poor men who did not own slaves, whose ancestors came to the United States to flee tyranny of the crown in their homelands. Do not fault them for fighting on behalf of the Southern United States, as they feared ever again falling under any sort of overarching system with tyranical levels of power. 

The desired outcome of the Civil War failed, Lincoln refused to pay back his debt to the Rothschild bank, and British agent John Wilkes Booth was thereby ordered to assassinate President Lincoln. 

From there, Manifest Destiny occurred, the Federal Reserve was soon established, and the United States...unknown to the common folks...fell under the rule of the Whore of Babylon and became a puppet state which began engaging colonialism. 

As many of you are very well aware, WWI and WWII were manufactured events beginning with the many wars in Europe of the 1800s. 

The OSS of WWII was a creation prompted by Britain's MI6...which ran an illegal propaganda campaign in the United States via a Canadian agent in order to turn the United States from being a neutral nation...only willing to join the war if attacked...into an ally of Britain via a media propaganda campaign in the U.S. against Germany. 

The OSS became the CIA, the CIA learned of ETI existence and whom they really served, Third Reich remnants in Antartica and their ETI allies made a truce with Eisenhower in 1952 (the UFOs over DC)...with Third Reich scientists repatriated to the United States under Operation Paperclip used as negotiators...and Eisenhower signed the Greada Treaty. 

CIA, in conjunction with the Military Industrial Complex, then runs wild and does whatever the hell it wants. Overthrows a democratically elected government in Iran since Mossadegh (President of Iran) refuses to play ball with the United States and Britain's demand for cheap oil access. 

Cheap oil access was only half truth. MIC and oil tycoon allies needed to be placated while Babylonian Talmudism Zionists searched for their real objective....Stargates in the Middle East. Yes, they exist. 

Iran was supposed to be the base of operations by which the United States and Great Britain...with their ""friendly"" ETI allies...would acquire the Stargate located in Iraq. It was sold to them as necessary to obtain control of the Stargate, otherwise ""enemy"" ETI would soon portal onto Earth. 

CIA tries to go behind Kennedy with trying to run a false flag in Cuba with a mini nuke on U.S. forces, Kennedy fires Dulles, demands CIA turns over all info re: ETI and military, CIA, MIC involvement....forces still loyal to Dulles in the CIA think little of Kennedy....and so bye, bye JFK. 

That was the day the United States, as it still exists in your head, officially died. Plans for 9/11 were made soon thereafter. The rest of the Cold War was scripted so that the U.S. MIC could milk every last dollar from the conflict and put it into the Central Banks of modern nations...thus into the hands of the Rothschilds...and thus into the hands of The Whore of Babylon and the City of London, that city from whence the entire world is run. 

Iran - Iraq War was an attempt to have Iraq topple Iran so that the United States could then intervene on behalf of its plant, Saddam, in ""rebuilding"" Iran. In reality, it was to get a foothold for access to the Stargate. 

Iraq War I was a fiction as well...with the real objective being the Stargate. 

It failed...hence why the fradulent securities were put in place from 9/10/91 to 9/13/91. 

9/11 was then carried out, Taliban was blamed for supporting Al-Qaeda (a CIA creation, same as ISIS), thus allowing the United States to use Afghanistan as a base of operations. 

WMD claim made by one guy back in 1999...Germany's BND sits on it for a bit...tells Bush administration...CIA is never allowed to interview the guy (became known as ""Curveball"")...didn't matter because war was planned years in advance with 9/11 as justification and to have the USSR out of the way by bankruptcy via fradulent securities. 

We go to war with Iraq, we find the Stargate in an ancient Babylonian temple, Green Zone is built around it, military even has ""Stargate Squads""...literally their name...patrolling the Stargate in the Green Zone. 

CIA was taken over by Zionist forces on 9/11, Office of Naval Intelligence was specifically targeted by a missle on 9/11 at Pentagon because they refused to go along and had the SSP (Secret Space Program) as leverage to stop it. Department of Homeland Security is a Zionist foothold organization in the United States and was created under the Patriot Act to create a police state. 

CIA, Mossad, Pakistani ISI, Saudia Arabian Intelligence, Jordanian Intelligence all ultimately serve MI6 and Whore of Mystery Babylon. 

Something is set to happen on September 23, 2017...and odds are that it's not in your favor. 

Remember your rights. Remember your Free Will. Remember these words. Humanity's current cycle very likely depends on it. 

Russia isn't your enemy
Syria isn't your enemy
Islamic refugees are not your enemy. 

Your enemy is Mossad and the ruling Zionists of Israel.
Your enemy is the CIA, private defense contractors like DynCorp and Stratfor, the heads of DHS

Your enemy is The Royal Family of GB and MI6.....Mystery Babylon....the humanoid servants of the 4th Dimensional beings of Darkness and The Draco Reptilian Masters.

...and your current President? He is being held hostage at gunpoint. 

If you are in the U.S Military, it may be time to start questioning those above you, the orders you've been given, for who and for what you're actually fighting....and if it is truly in the interests of those you're sworn to protect, the principles you're sworn to protect....and in the interests of humanity as a whole. 

You create your reality. Truth can make set you free without bloodshed, but know that you have been under attack for decades and it is the right of all humanity to unite and take back...by any means...that freedom endowed to them by their creator in nature...those inalienable rights which sparked a bunch of farmers and boys to rise up against the tyranical power of the world in 1776.

All that I have stated was learned in the past 9 months...and long rumored things about the family into which I was born...were confirmed via original source material...which had not seen the light of day in over 30 years...via original source material.

....I found this material the day before Easter 2017.

Last fall, noticing Venus ""The Morning Star"" was brighter than any star in the sky, and doing things no planet should do, I sat outside one night and meditated/prayed to this Light...asking for answers or guidance in relation to events of late which could not be explained.

That evening my consciousness was taken to Antarctica and I was given a message by a woman...who looked like that which you'd call an Angel...and received the message which set me on this course.

From that time until I discovered the source material, I was guided by beings of Light from that 4th Dimension and soon learned how information was being given to me via synchronicity events and how I was to know that a discovery was an event.

Believe me if you want. Reject me if you want. I care not because to say nothing would be condemning humanity. 

I went from caring only about myself and material matters...yet a ""spiritualist""...to suddenly believing in the existence of a Godhead.
I am that one Revelation calls the Evangelist.

I was not supposed to be born; one was to come before me yet died in the womb.

I was born to a family which set up the system, with good intention, to unknowingly allow all of the events after WWII to occur.

I was born to a man whose father was a 32nd degree Free Mason...convinced to join after WWII by a friend...who lived near the Bush compound in Maine in his retired years. I'd spend summers up there.

My family was a normal, well to do suburban family. Events in life changed that in my twenties and what happened from September to a few weeks ago was my awakening and my call to leave behind the rat race and pursuit of the material.

Greater forces are at work. So many of you complain about the state of the world, yet expect change to come by the hand of those very people you elect and decry as corrupt. Complaining will not change corruption.

You cannot bring about change by still playing within the current system. This system is set up to subjugate you and then destroy you...with only a few picked to remain so that humanity is cast back to the stone age...if you get too close to the truth.

Humanity is close...and you have all the forces of Darkness afraid that this time you'll win. Because humanity has knocked on the door before, only to retreat in fear at the last minute and allow the Darkness to reset into a new cycle.

 I wasn't supposed to be born...yet I was and was born into the family I described. The birth of a child (not mine) precipitated the start of my 9 month awakening.  I was recruited into the CIA out of college. I was deep into Dem politics and could have easily been in Seth Rich's shoes. I went through these past 9 months because I looked up to The Morning Star and asked for guidance. I turned away from the gold chalice and the Serpent. I've been to Ephesus and prayed there while receiving the Holy Water. As a kid, almost from birth, I feared death. I said I had lived before and that this world felt foreign to me. I'd say I was home but not home.


The false Israelites are those you think. Israel...the anti-Christ...6 points on the flag, 6 triangles on the flag, and the Pentagon (6) within the Star of David on the flag...are those who serve the Synagogue of Satan (Babylonian Talmudism)...and you, the people of Palestine, are rightful descendants of Abraham, one of the 12 tribes, and I acknowledge your suffering.
