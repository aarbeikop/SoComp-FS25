"5l5td5","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","A plea for compassion, sanity, and care for the New Year. [Long]","Two men are in a fast food restaurant's restroom, doing what individuals will do. The man in the stall has trouble breathing, falls to the floor, muttering, ""911... call 911."" The other man leaves, walks up to the counter and says, ""Yeah uh, there's a guy in the men's room, on the floor, saying we should call 911? I dunno. You might wanna do that."" Then leaves.

People stand around asking what should be done. The manager is filling fry cartons. The phone line is tied up into the fax machine.

Something inside you snaps, ""Call 911. Get the manager. Do it now."" You go into the restroom. A doctor who was there for lunch on his off day is tending to the man. A lady calls 911. You relay the mans name, age and condition to the 911 dispatcher.

Slowly moving the old man out, the ambulance arrives. He'd been suffering this for a few days now, and was on his way to the walk in clinic to get medical treatment. Now he's at least being looked at.

This was my afternoon, for a very long twenty minutes. I need to say this. Because it's important, and I think as a society we've lost sight of the emotional component that makes us who we are.

The first man who stated indifferently to the restaurant personnel at the counter about the situation, sticks out in my mind. I don't know what I'd classify him as. Partially empathetic maybe, but certainly indifferent. To see a fellow human being in need, asking for help and not even pulling out a cell phone to make the call yourself. We all have to be somewhere. I understand that. However I cannot fathom getting the short end of the stick from anyone saying, ""Yeah, this guy was having an issue and I needed to call 911. I wanted to make sure he was okay."" I would further hate to meet the person who would give ANYONE the short end of the stick for doing the right thing.

The manager on duty. Filling fry orders. Not aware of what's going on despite the commotion. When the topic of, ""Should I call 911"" is uttered, your attention should snap to. Someone may be having a medical emergency in your establishment. Even if you have no medical training, you need to be there, and be the one to call 911. But you weren't. I had to BARK at you, ""You're the manager on duty, you need to be BACK THERE."" This was after the doctor had started helping the man. As the manager you SHOULD have been the one to call 911.

AND ALSO. SERIOUSLY. This just. This is why I HATE Fax Machines. You have ONE PHONE LINE. For the ENTIRE STORE. And you cannot make the 911 call... BECAUSE THE FAX MACHINE IS TYING UP THE LINE AND TO PICK UP AND DIAL OUT WOULD BREAK THE TRANSMISSION. This is absolutely ridiculous. I get... These companies want to save money. But .... Anyways.

It blew me away. Out of the thirty some odd people in the store, all confused about what's going on, a scant handful actually went, ""What can we do?"" That man was 62 years old. My dad is older. And the last thing anyone wants to hear is about their dad buying it in a place like a fast food restaurant, on the toilet, because no one cared enough to see he got help.

I would die if I ever got that phone call.

People are too cloistered. Into their cell phones, their safe spaces, their little worlds. Maybe we've become too desensitized and simply have grown indifferent thinking, ""Well it happens every day.""

But does it really excuse simply standing by and letting it happen? To merely get up, off your ass, and do the right thing, at the right time, because you're there? And you *can* do something? Even if it's simply to call 911 and offer a few minutes of your time to relay the information to the dispatcher, who can get that info to the EMTs? Or the elderly woman who offered the use of her diabetic supplies in the event it was a diabetic related incident? Even holding the door open to allow other to help the man outside, getting him a chair from the restaurant to sit on?

Little things. Little things add up in a big way. It's one of those few instances in life where politics, ideology, race, origin... None of that matters. An individual needs help. Even though you say, ""But I /really/ want an iced mocha coffee..."" .... It can wait. Everything can wait. That two or ten or twenty minutes of your day, however long it takes, might ensure that someone gets to live.

If there is one thing that we need now more than ever in this world of hate, violence and intolerance, it's compassion, with the sanity of mind to put our differences aside and care for anyone who needs help on this planet.

I don't really know what else to say. I simply had to get this out... Sorry.","2016-12-30 21:06:07","6","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/5l5td5/a_plea_for_compassion_sanity_and_care_for_the_new/","True","graywolf0026","1747876758.7718358","our planet is dying","manual"

#My original post: 

""In a world where millions of people die of starvation and starvation-related diseases, we still inexplicably insist on the gross inefficiency of cycling our plant production through animals before considering it 'food.'""

-- T. Colin Campbell, ""Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition""

#Their reply: 

Or we could let the animals who survive on plants die of starvation and not have to worry about them anymore at all. 

#Me: 

The animals that are alive now are going to be slaughtered either way, that's not a long-term issue. All we have to do to solve that problem is stop breeding them in the first place.

#Them: 

Stop breeding = effectively wiping out entire species of animals, namely pigs, cattle, and chickens.

From a *small farm* perspective, animals are a great resource to farms. Not just because they are used as food for humans.

1. Not all crops are fit for human consumption. Crops are graded and based on the grad the crop gets (for it's nutritional and seed value) it is determined what it is used for. Be it to go to processing for human consumption, reused as seed for another year, or made into feed for animals because it can't be used for either of the other two things and would then be thrown out.

2. Plant waste, such as straw is used as bedding for animals and then reused and mixed with manure for fertilizer. Small barns are not heated for animals, so straw is used to insulate barns and helps keep animals comfortable. Hay, which can't be consumed by humans is used as a type of feed for animals.

2. Animal manure is an amazing fertilizer. Farms need to fertilize their crops, and manure is a great way to do this. It reduces the cost of purchasing fertilizer for smaller farmers as they can use the manure from their animals to work into the ground reducing their need to purchase fertilizer. Using manure helps to *reduce* the need to mine the nutrients directly from the soils at large potash mines.

3. Not everyone can eat a plant based diet. You personally know someone who can't eat a plant based diet. They would die.

4. It isn't just meat that is used from animals. It's many things. Bones for soup stock or for dogs to chew, gelatin (a food product), leather, glue, etc. In terms of waste, almost all parts of an animal can be used to benefit humans.

Small farms depend on both animals and plants to survive. Butchering animals for food as well as selling them is a huge part of a small mixed farm. As well, the animals can use the plant waste more effectively than humans can.

Want to help starving nations? Maybe we need to ask those starving nations what they need to make their food production better for them rather than forcing everyone in the world to stop using animals as produce.

This will be my last engagement on this as honestly, I'm rather upset by the quote and the first world issues it brings up without offering any solutions on how to solve world hunger through a plant only diet while attempting to shame people who need or want to eat meat in their diets.

#Me:

What does that have to do with the 56 billion animals in factory farms slaughtered each year? On sanctuary farms, they still make use of the fertilisers produced by animals, but they allow them to live out their natural lifespans. You don't have to eat a cow to use its poop.

The poorest people in the world aren't my target. They already eat 98% plant-based because they actually have to pay the true price of meat, making it inaccessible. When prices in North America reflected the true cost of producing it, even the middle class only had meat a few times a week. Poor people were lucky if they got a turkey at Christmas and a ham at Easter; mostly they ate the remnants, and usually half-spoiled at that. ""Quality"" meat is accessible now only because of government subsidies to animal feed, and that's the part that pisses me off. Not only is our culture's obsession with meat killing the planet and our bodies, but those of us who choose not to partake are still forced to pay for the meat consumption of others. Meat is unhealthy and should not be subsidised, at least while fruits and vegetables are not.

There are healthy vegans who can't have legumes and nuts. Calorie for calorie, lettuce contains more protein than beef. Protein needs of humans are grossly misunderstood by our culture. You only need 10-15% of your calories from protein, and that's coincidentally the level found in virtually all whole plant foods except starches. Protein needs could easily be met with pumpkin and hemp seeds, brown rice, quinoa, and fruits & vegetables. Sure it would have less variety than including dairy, eggs, and meat; but ""unappealing"" is not the same as ""impossible.""","2016-12-25 06:37:34","1","5","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/5k7a8k/is_this_attacking_meat_eaters/","True","Schrodingers_Ape","1747876950.626684","our planet is dying","manual"

Exactly one year after Admiral Byrds expedition, NASA was invented. Smart move...get the mass population to focus on what's in the sky rather then what's below us. 

In Serbia a W Mammoth was found frozen. The mammoths blood was in liquid form and the meat was fresh. How can a mammoth 40,000 y/o have liquid blood? Did it fall out of the inner earth and die a sudden death and freeze? We know General Byrd saw a mammoth during his voyage. 
I also read about another mammoth was found frozen in LAKE WATER and stilll had fresh greenery in its teeth and stomach. How was the mammoth frozen in lake water if it was found in the ocean?  I can't find the article tho. The one below it the mammoth with liquid blood.

3. In 2005, the US MILITARY was attacked by a 12 ft, 1100lbs red hair 6 toes/6 finger giant. The giant killed one solider before the giant was killed. The book of Enoch gives the exact description of this Giant, which is called the nephillim. The nephillim was the off spring of fallen angels and a woman.  The military and media kept this from the public, but why? 
[12 ft Giant killed by US Military in Afgan Cave ](https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=hr4IB79upbE)


Giants Mentioned in the Bible:

The book of Enoch, which was left out of the Bible, explains these Giants and relation to the fallen angels in great detail. 
[Long video, but explains the book of Enoch in great detail ]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1zz8_MxcnzY)
According to the Book of Enoch, God judged the angels for producing the Nephilim. God decreed that the fallen angels (Watchers) were to be cast into Tartarus.The Nephilim were also judged and it was determined that their bodies were to return to the earth in peace but their souls were doomed. 
What is Tartarus? is the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans. As far below Hades as the earth is below the heavens.  
IS THE TARTARUS THE INNER EARTH???

Also, Genesis SAYS GIANTS LIVED HERE BEFORE THE FLOOD AND AFTER. WHERE ARE THESE GIANTS AT??
(Genesis 6:4)
(Original KJV): “There were giants in the earth in those days; and ALSO AFTER THAT, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.”

Before the flood there were 409,000 Giants that lived on the surface of the planet. There's huge structures that couldnt possibly be moved by any type of technology we have today. Are these structures the Giants built?

In the [Catholic Church ](https://sli.mg/i5gP1y) they worship the Sun hidden in plain sight. Tricking the mass population to worship the sun started during the Roman Empire. If you look closely the sun symbols resembles ancient Egypt drawings. You will also notice the ancient God [sitting down](https://sli.mg/7lEYm7) is much larger then the ""peasants"" at his feet. Is this a giant? Do the fallen angels worship the sun? The sun means ""the morning star"" and the Bible refers Jesus and Lucifer as the morning stars, so you wonder which one are they referring to...

[Are the GovernmentS hiding Giants and hybrids from us] (https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=hIogKJ--4NE)


Are the world leaders hiding the truth about our planet being hollow in order to hide GIANTS and hybrids? If Giants were the offspring of woman and fallen angel, then is the Nazi army admiral Byrd saw an offspring of Nazi and fallen angels? Are they hiding the army of the antichrist under our feet? Are they reproducing and getting ready to go to war against us in the battle of Armageddon ? Is the entrance to the underworld in Antarctica? Was NASA formed to focus our  attention to the sky's rather then what's underneath us? 

Let me say this... the elites rewrote history and created their own.  They use religion to control the mass population, which is why I'm not religious. I believe in God, the Son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Use the Holy Spirit to help you search for TRUTH.   
Don't get caught up in [Martix the elites created] (https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=tV8S05EgnIs) They are NOT human and they are here to Deceive us. When it is time, they will call on their army out of hibernation from the inner earth for the last grand battle of Armageddon.

“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”

Celebrity Tila Tequila: Missing Children & Cloning Centers
Tila Tequila talks about missing children and cloning centers on November 7, 2012. This is the only time that she mentioned cloning centers 

Tila Tequila said all that a little after her ""brain aneurysm"" and ""overdose"" in 2012: http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/03/tila-tequila-hospitalized-brain-aneurism-drug-overdose-almost-died/

She had been whistleblowing about the iIluminati before her hospitalization: 
http://theydontseethroughus.blogspot.ru/2012/03/tila-tequilas-dangerous-crusade-against.html?m=1

You can see in the excerpt from her blog she is rationally and articulately talking about the satanic imagery in gaga's music videos and the media, hollywood and establishment's plans for a new world order.

>Now I was hesitant to write this blog as I know they are forever watching and are very POWERFUL. But I feel as a HUMAN BEING, people have a RIGHT to know what is happening to them and I am here, God sent me here, to fight this War against the Darkness and these people who practice Satanic Rituals, that is now being shown on our TV for even CHILDREN to watch! I mean, Lady GaGa hung herself at one of the music video awards with blood dripping everywhere! Now on her new “ALEJANDRO” cover there is a devil-like man carrying her naked, lifeless body, with a HUGE SLIT on the side of her and blood. Yet people think that’s ok just because it’s “ART?” no.

>Ok well if you guys are interested, i will tell you more. This is just the first level, i can take you deep, deep, deep into this and teach you so much more about the crazy mad poop that has been going on, and who is in alliance with who. You would be SHOCKED to know. But just know, they “THEY” have been lying to you guys for a VERY LONG TIME!

>I gotta go now, don’t wanna cause too much commotion about this before they come and do me wrong again. I will tell you one day how they did me wrong because I knew stuff about them. MAJOR stuff about them and once they found out that I knew, the did some fracked up poop. They own the majority of the media. They can do and say whatever they want, Anyway, enough for now….

http://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280

1) Polar bears, seals and walruses along the Alaska coastline are suffering from fur loss and open sores…

    Wildlife experts are studying whether fur loss and open sores detected in nine polar bears in recent weeks is widespread and related to similar incidents among seals and walruses.

    The bears were among 33 spotted near Barrow, Alaska, during routine survey work along the Arctic coastline. Tests showed they had “alopecia, or loss of fur, and other skin lesions,” the U.S. Geological Survey said in a statement.

2) There is an epidemic of sea lion deaths along the California coastline…

    At island rookeries off the Southern California coast, 45 percent of the pups born in June have died, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service based in Seattle. Normally, less than one-third of the pups would die.   It’s gotten so bad in the past two weeks that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an “unusual mortality event.”

3) Along the Pacific coast of Canada and the Alaska coastline, the population of sockeye salmon is at a historic low.  Many are blaming Fukushima.

4) Something is causing fish all along the west coast of Canada to bleed from their gills, bellies and eyeballs.

5) A vast field of radioactive debris from Fukushima that is approximately the size of California has crossed the Pacific Ocean and is starting to collide with the west coast.

6) It is being projected that the radioactivity of coastal waters off the U.S. west coast could double over the next five to six years.

7) Experts have found very high levels of cesium-137 in plankton living in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and the west coast.

8) One test in California found that 15 out of 15 bluefin tuna were contaminated with radiation from Fukushima.

9) Back in 2012, the Vancouver Sun reported that cesium-137 was being found in a very high percentage of the fish that Japan was selling to Canada…

• 73 percent of mackerel tested

• 91 percent of the halibut

• 92 percent of the sardines

• 93 percent of the tuna and eel

• 94 percent of the cod and anchovies

• 100 percent of the carp, seaweed, shark and monkfish

10) Canadian authorities are finding extremely high levels of nuclear radiation in certain fish samples…

    Some fish samples tested to date have had very high levels of radiation: one sea bass sample collected in July, for example, had 1,000 becquerels per kilogram of cesium.

11) Some experts believe that we could see very high levels of cancer along the west coast just from people eating contaminated fish…

    “Look at what’s going on now: They’re dumping huge amounts of radioactivity into the ocean — no one expected that in 2011,” Daniel Hirsch, a nuclear policy lecturer at the University of California-Santa Cruz, told Global Security Newswire. “We could have large numbers of cancer from ingestion of fish.”

12) BBC News recently reported that radiation levels around Fukushima are “18 times higher” than previously believed.

13) An EU-funded study concluded that Fukushima released up to 210 quadrillion becquerels of cesium-137 into the atmosphere.

14) Atmospheric radiation from Fukushima reached the west coast of the United States within a few days back in 2011.

15) At this point, 300 tons of contaminated water is pouring into the Pacific Ocean from Fukushima every single day.

16) A senior researcher of marine chemistry at the Japan Meteorological Agency’s Meteorological Research Institute says that “30 billion becquerels of radioactive cesium and 30 billion becquerels of radioactive strontium” are being released into the Pacific Ocean from Fukushima every single day.

17) According to Tepco, a total of somewhere between 20 trillion and 40 trillion becquerels of radioactive tritium have gotten into the Pacific Ocean since the Fukushima disaster first began.

18) According to a professor at Tokyo University, 3 gigabecquerels of cesium-137 are flowing into the port at Fukushima Daiichi every single day.

19) It has been estimated that up to 100 times as much nuclear radiation has been released into the ocean from Fukushima than was released during the entire Chernobyl disaster.

20) One recent study concluded that a very large plume of cesium-137 from the Fukushima disaster will start flowing into U.S. coastal waters early next year…

Ocean simulations showed that the plume of radioactive cesium-137 released by the Fukushima disaster in 2011 could begin flowing into U.S. coastal waters starting in early 2014 and peak in 2016.

21) It is being projected that significant levels of cesium-137 will reach every corner of the Pacific Ocean by the year 2020.

22) It is being projected that the entire Pacific Ocean will soon “have cesium levels 5 to 10 times higher” than what we witnessed during the era of heavy atomic bomb testing in the Pacific many decades ago.

23) The immense amounts of nuclear radiation getting into the water in the Pacific Ocean has caused environmental activist Joe Martino to issue the following warning…

    “Your days of eating Pacific Ocean fish are over.”

24) The Iodine-131, Cesium-137 and Strontium-90 that are constantly coming from Fukushima are going to affect the health of those living the the northern hemisphere for a very, very long time.  Just consider what Harvey Wasserman had to say about this…

Iodine-131, for example, can be ingested into the thyroid, where it emits beta particles (electrons) that damage tissue. A plague of damaged thyroids has already been reported among as many as 40 percent of the children in the Fukushima area. That percentage can only go higher. In developing youngsters, it can stunt both physical and mental growth. Among adults it causes a very wide range of ancillary ailments, including cancer.

Cesium-137 from Fukushima has been found in fish caught as far away as California. It spreads throughout the body, but tends to accumulate in the muscles.

Strontium-90’s half-life is around 29 years. It mimics calcium and goes to our bones.

25) According to a recent Planet Infowars report, the California coastline is being transformed into “a dead zone”…

The California coastline is becoming like a dead zone.

If you haven’t been to a California beach lately, you probably don’t know that the rocks are unnaturally CLEAN – there’s hardly any kelp, barnacles, sea urchins, etc. anymore and the tide pools are similarly eerily devoid of crabs, snails and other scurrying signs of life… and especially as compared to 10 – 15 years ago when one was wise to wear tennis shoes on a trip to the beach in order to avoid cutting one’s feet on all the STUFF of life – broken shells, bones, glass, driftwood, etc.

There are also days when I am hard-pressed to find even a half dozen seagulls and/or terns on the county beach.

You can still find a few gulls trolling the picnic areas and some of the restaurants (with outdoor seating areas) for food, of course, but, when I think back to 10 – 15 years ago, the skies and ALL the beaches were literally filled with seagulls and the haunting sound of their cries both day and night…

NOW it’s unnaturally quiet.

26) A study conducted last year came to the conclusion that radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster could negatively affect human life along the west coast of North America from Mexico to Alaska “for decades”.

27) According to the Wall Street Journal, it is being projected that the cleanup of Fukushima could take up to 40 years to complete.

28) Yale Professor Charles Perrow is warning that if the cleanup of Fukushima is not handled with 100% precision that humanity could be threatened “for thousands of years“…

    “Conditions in the unit 4 pool, 100 feet from the ground, are perilous, and if any two of the rods touch it could cause a nuclear reaction that would be uncontrollable. The radiation emitted from all these rods, if they are not continually cool and kept separate, would require the evacuation of surrounding areas including Tokyo. Because of the radiation at the site the 6,375 rods in the common storage pool could not be continuously cooled; they would fission and all of humanity will be threatened, for thousands of years.”
