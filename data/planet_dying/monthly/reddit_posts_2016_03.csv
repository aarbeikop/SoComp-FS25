"4bm4d0","environment","emotional","Save Water, Save Life and Save the World","Leonardo da Vinci once said that “ Water is the driver of Nature.” When we speak the word water it seems to be just a five letter word but these five letters equals the value of earths five continents. The life existing in these continents is because of water only. It’s the water which continues the life cycle on earth making us an exception in the whole universe. 

Like Leonardo said that water is the driver of nature, it proceeds life forward in the right direction and the worst part is that we never understand its importance. We are like the passenger who is sitting behind in his seat relaxing and never understand the efforts put by the driver to move the vehicle forward. But it’s time for us to understand that life can’t continue without water and we have to save it. It’s our planet, it’s our water and only we are responsible for its conservation.

Like Benjamin Franklin said: “When the well is dry, we know the worth of water.”  Maybe that’s why people in deserted area understand the importance of water who doesn’t even believe in wasting filthy water. As per the survey conducted by United Nation most girls in Rajasthan never went to schools because they are required to fetch water from long distances. These girls walk miles to fetch water which takes their whole day and therefore they have no time to attend  school. In a world where people are dying of drought how could one waste water for their selfish motives.

"493kzt","conspiracy","unknown","A letter to the people of Earth","So, just to clarify; none of us has any idea what the true origins of humanity are. We have pieces, pieces that have been broken by the victors of countless wars. 

If something I say in this letter offends you, good. This information is offensive, its damning, its tragic, and its hard to hear. But, its the truth.

""The truth shall set you free""

We believe that civilization began about 6,000 years ago, in a place once called Sumer; now known as Iraq. The history books tell us this. This is a lie. Geological evidence of erosion from Stonehenge suggests that it was erected somewhere between 500,000 to 1,000,000 years ago. It is a well known fact that the Sphinx in Egypt is well over 20,000 years old. Gold mines in Africa have been discovered in over a dozen countries that simply must have been dug tens of thousands of years ago, yet they are cut through the Earth with such precision; our modern technology and all its glory could not re-create the efficiency.

These are just a few basic examples of how our history is much older, and much stranger than the history books at your University allow you to think. 

If you looked into these topics deeply, with an open mind; you would begin to see a pattern. The pattern is such: someone makes a discovery, someone else verifies the discovery, someone more powerful then enters the situation (like a Museum or a government, or someone with ""authority"") and takes the discovery away, or makes it out to be a hoax, or outright steals and conceals it.

Such has been the case with literally tens of thousands of discoveries throughout just the last few centuries.

The purpose of all this secrecy?

The purpose is to keep you small, to make you small, to make you feel like a stranger on your own planet, to jeopardize your relationships with other people when you ask scary questions, to vilify you in social circles, to discredit the honest researcher, etc. 

The purpose is control.

A long time ago, at an undisclosed date, (We're talking tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years ago) what we'll call the ""Priest Class"" arose in a forgotten civilization. You could call it Atlantis, you could call Old Egypt; it doesn't matter; we're talking about the same people. These men made discoveries about nature, reality, physics, geometry, time, philosophy, and spirituality that today would blow our minds. 

For what I imagine was a long time, mankind flourished. It was a golden age.

Something happened. We'll call it X. X entered the situation. X could be a dark spirit, X could be aliens, X could be Satan himself, X could be just a really bad guy who got greedy.

X did something to us. 

X took the knowledge from the people and entrusted it unto to Priest Class. This corrupted the Priest Class to the core, because ""absolute power corrupts, absolutely.""

The rest folks, ""is history.""

They scattered our people to the wind, they destroyed our sacred knowledge and gathered it into vaults and underground bases, they hid our true power and dignity from us, they confused us with different languages, cultures, and religions to keep us fighting each other, they wounded the planet's spirit and imprisoned her in a near-never ending cycle of destruction, they, over time, stole all of the world's mineral wealth and hid it from us; allowing us to starve and cannibalize each other out of desperation.

We are their slaves. This is a letter from a man who wishes to break the chains. We are ALL slaves. Even if you can't see it, you will. They are seeking to overtly enslave us AGAIN. The internet is too powerful, its too much freedom and connection between the various groups of slaves.

They made a mistake.

We have to capitalize on that mistake.

I will die for you.

Will you die for me?
