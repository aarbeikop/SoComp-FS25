"alcssg","collapse","skeptical","The industrialized world condemned the third world to death","[Here's](https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-protesters-march-against-coal-plant/4425482.html) something you haven't seen before. Kenyans are protesting in the street when the Chinese try to open a new coal plant in Kenya.

Most Kenyans don't have electricity. If you take a single intercontinental flight, you emit carbon equal to that of a Kenyan family in an entire year. Kenyans don't cause global warming, but they go out into the street because they don't want to contribute to it. The industrialized world is causing this problem and is capable of ending it. The developing world is merely going to feel the impact.

The photos of the Kenyans who are protesting in the street with their skeleton suits on are photos that are going to be haunting us fifty years from now. When the Earth warms, the biggest impact will take place in those countries near the equator. The ones who feel the biggest impact are those who are least responsible.

I have a boss who bought an expensive car the other day, he proclaimed that you only live once. There's an implication there, the idea that actions that benefit you at the cost of others have no further impact on you, other than those that can be proven through empirical science. 

You live, you die, that's it. That's the attitude that now characterizes Western civilization. There's no reincarnation, no Saint Peter to judge whether you might be allowed into heaven. If you have concern for others, especially people you'll never meet, it's merely an irrational cognitive flaw that negatively affects your own wellbeing.

That's why our politicians and our population are quite comfortable not making genuine sacrifices to preserve a habitable planet. You can look at the IPCC documents and although they are of course rather conservative, they show that wealthy countries far from the equator are not really harmed initially from a modest temperature rise of 2 degree above pre-industrial. Our harvests increase and the impacts are relatively minor.

So, that's what we do. We make some modest changes, we don't allow them to affect our economy or our standard of living and we keep in the back of our mind that we'll eventually need to transition away from fossil fuels anyway. ""We could use some global warming."" That's what Trump says, that's what your uncle says. There's an awareness, at some level, that we're not the ones paying the price.

And it's true. Canada can get away with some global warming. Russia can get away with some global warming. The costs to us of an early transition may very well exceed the direct benefits it has to us. Here's what Trudeau says to a conference of oil magnates: “No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there,” There is a country that would leave oil in the ground: A country that doesn't want to put the burden of its own wealth on other people. It's not a guy like Trump, who is too stupid to understand what's going on, who scares me. It's a guy like Trudeau, who perfectly understands who he is condemning to death through his choices. 

What Trudeau says is a tacit admission that we don't really care about other people. We're nice to the people we meet on a daily basis, because that's how our brains function and because it makes our lives easier. And Trudeau knows of course that Canada won't genuinely be affected, as long as the world eventually transitions.

But there are some people who will be affected: The people who put on their skeleton suits and go out into the streets of Nairobi. They're the people who are paying the price for what's going on now, for the choices that are being made now. If we assume that we don't care about people we'll never meet, then I guess you can say there are no measurable consequences for us.

But I can not escape the notion from my mind, that at some level we will be paying the price. What's happening now is not very different from what happened throughout history. American frontier settlers were men low on the social pyramid, but part of a civilization with advanced technology. They arrive in California, seize land for themselves, find native Pomo with inferior technology, turn them into slaves, earn money by bringing decapitated heads into town and sexually abuse the young girls. They eventually marry, have children and profit handsomely from the land they seized for themselves. They destroyed the lives of other people but they die in comfort, they die as men high in status loved by those around them. That's how life worked out in America for centuries.

It's easy to assume there are no consequences, we live out our lives with a mentality that suggests there are no consequences to the suffering we impose upon others. We have done so for centuries, it seems to have grown worse as we lost faith in an afterlife. My boss said you only live once. I said to him that I always hear people say this, but that I've never seen anyone manage to prove it. It's the first time I've ever seen him nervous.","2019-01-30 13:43:59","253","80","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/alcssg/the_industrialized_world_condemned_the_third/","True","ididwtc","1747921546.44466","our planet is dying","manual"

"ak2ts9","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","How do you all find hope to go on?","Our situation in the world just seems so hopeless. Our planet is dying, maybe faster than we thought. Politics have fallen into a shitshow circus. The middle class is dying. Oligarchs are closing their grip on the world. 

I feel so negative about everything. How do you all find hope to go on? I promise I’m not trolling, just also at a crossroads in my life and I can’t figure out what’s worth doing.

"al0mz0","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","Banned from a local club I helped build up","The past 10 years I have been helping to build a local scientific community that is focussed on astronomy and meteorology. It grew out to be pretty prominent. We had a solid club that was growing, over 100 members when I left.

We started great events and lectures, but money was needed so I wanted to get us government funds. Being scientific, we were in a great spot! Not only were there funds for communities and clubs, but the government actively wants to help scientific clubs increase in popularity by providing money to host events. 

This is where the conflict started. The board of the old community was still around, and they were all 70+. Not that that is a bad thing, but the only answer to government funding was ""no"". No reason aside from ""30 years ago it was terrible for communities"". It was, but this is a new day and age. Nowadays my country has special money jars for clubs like ours so the public can get involved in science.

But okay... I figured they would leave or die one day, leaving new spots to new people, so there was hope. Dont get me wrong, they were mostly great people, just terrible board members.

I went on and gave lectures, I organised lectures from well known speakers and scientist (even an astronaut!), I hosted events, but I honestly felt as if they were out to sabotage me.

During a  science week, we hosted a small lecture event, with lectures from our own members aimed at what triggered their enthausiasm for astronomy (our building was marked as the astronomy spot during the week). I had hosted it, made sure we had telescopes ready, pictures of stunning nebulae could be made by visitors, and I even had a setup that allowed them to take pictures of the moon with their own phones. The large lecture hall housed the people talking about their hobby, and it went great! At first at least....

All speakers had 20 minutes, with 10 minutes inbetween speakers. First one, 15 minutes of speaking and 5 for questions, and I loved it! Second, 25 minutes of speaking so I was sweating there but people liked it... Third again a nice 20 minutes total. But the fourth... A well-counted 110 minutes. And it was the acting chairman of the club, so every time I told him to quit, he just said to the whole room that he is the chairman so he makes the rules.

Worst of all, people loved everything apart from his lecture. They wanted it to end as they didn't want to leave in the middle of it.

People kept sending me moon pictures made with their phones, or even a regular camera with zoom lenses. They were amazed at the details they had captured. I loved that as that got people interested. 

People didnt come back. The reason? They were afraid of another 2hour long lecture about things they didnt come to hear. 

After a while, I wanted another event during a solar eclipse, but this time everyone truely got 20 minutes. I stressed that as people hated the long lecture and that it chased people away. Mister chairman told me that people come to hear him, and I couldnt give him rules, so I got removed from the list of members and got banned from the building.

What hurt me most was that they also banned my daughter, who was 5 at the time. She grew to love looking at planets and learning about them. Currently she is writing a school assignment about the planets of the solar system. She loved to be there and look through the large telescopes. She has her own now, but it still sucks.

Now, a few years later, they host less than half the events I did because the events they do host barely bring any money into the club and people left because the chairman gives all the lectures and they seem to be boring.","2019-01-29 14:42:25","36","2","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/al0mz0/banned_from_a_local_club_i_helped_build_up/","True","Amayax","1747922097.499347","our planet is dying","manual"
"ahzeha","vegan","unknown","Don’t be a meek vegan. Don’t be afraid to mention you are vegan, or to talk about how awful meat consumption is for the planet","So many people online try to silence vegans or claim that we’re constantly shoving our vegan life in their faces. These types of people are insecure, they know eating meat is bad, so your existence makes them face that.

I have been meatless my whole life. Even as a child I had to face adults who would berate me with reasons why they or why I should eat meat.

Kids told me I would die if I didn’t eat meat (this was the 90s mind you), I was even told God wanted his children to eat meat and that it was sacrilegious to not eat animals 😂!

But now people are going vegan because they’re dying or they’re watching their unhealthy family members die of preventable illnesses.

I’m so glad that people are finally seeing the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. I just wish they were more enlightened before experiencing serious illnesses ","2019-01-20 16:50:59","265","25","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ahzeha/dont_be_a_meek_vegan_dont_be_afraid_to_mention/","True","greenteasweetpea","1747922228.639524","our planet is dying","manual"
"alen3f","vegan","unknown","Almond Milk...Not Vegan","With the amount of bees that die and are displaced from their natural habitat to pollinate almond trees, consuming almonds and almond products does not fit in line with the values of veganism. 

Veganism is a philosophy that we can all strive towards because it’s nearly impossible to be fully vegan on this planet in a modern culture, however, we don’t need to be consuming almond or almond products when there are a boat load of alternatives.

Every time I come on here I always see posts about almonds and I think it’s important we factor in the reality of what it takes to create them and the products. 





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update: Thank you all for the comments and discussion. I'm not trying to make anyone feel guilty and I know that from the curious person looking into veganism and the 25+ years vegan, we are all on our own journeys and have a different opinion on what makes something vegan. 

I'll only call myself a vegan if someone asks are you vegan? If I have time to go into a philosophical conversation, I'll explain that I'm not vegan but I try to mold myself life around the tenants of veganism, sustainability and causing the least amount of suffering I can on this planet. 

I love you all, regardless of what you define yourself as. We are all here together and I know we can make a better and brighter vegan world!","2019-01-30 16:51:59","0","41","0.29","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/alen3f/almond_milknot_vegan/","True","goodvibessss","1747922247.081901","our planet is dying","manual"
