"a31q8o","climate","scientific","How about a serious conversation about this?","What if humanity talk openly about what we pretty much all agree on by now:


1. No one alive knows for a certainty where we came from, or why.

2. We are a naturally curious and inovative animal. 

3. We are intrigued by the concept of life and death. Born with existential questions. 

4. We have progressed as a species far enough to know we exist on a tiny orb in a universe far more vast than our brains even have the capacity to imagine. 

5. Said universe is for us intensly hostile but, by some astronomical stroke of luck, we have the opportunity to exist here. To live. 

6. We know earth has an expiery date (altough we all may disagree on what that date is). 

7. We know we spend a tiny amount of money on science to understand what we are compared to what we spend on military, disagreeing and killing each other.

8. We all want our loved ones safe and the best possible future for generations to come.

9. None of us seem too happy about where humanity is headed...

10. We are not, as humans, talking about this.

Why? 


Can we not hit pause for a moment, think, then have a conversation about This? 

Do we not owe it to all the generations that led up to us and all the generations to come to sit down and be reasonable people? 

Is it too big a subject or are we simply distracted by the society we happened to be born into? 
Is there even a chance that we can agree on something bigger, that's more important than personal gain?

What if the way to change the world is to shift the colletive minds to focus on bigger things than individual success.

We can read an atricle that says:
""A huge asteroid approaches Earth, August 29, 2018""
Without making much of a fuss about it. That seems disconnected to me. What will it take for us to take our own existece seriously?

If we don't manage to unite as a species and work together on the one planet we have, we are basically waiting for our own extintion, and sort of just fine with it.
Casually buying shit produced under horrofying conditions whilst patting ourselfes on the shoulder for donating $1 to climatesupport (only when in a good mood and happened to have some spare change).
Without changing the way the world is viewed we know we're more or less fucked. 
This should be a Big issue but nobody seems interested in talking about it. 

What use is it to have been alive if we role the dice on our own legacy whilst also knowing we had an honest chance to activly make it better? Safer and more fair for every one, not just ourselfs and our closest circle. Why can't we see the Great value in that?

Imagine if we tried to preserve our species, literally, as long as humanly possible?
Is that not a worthier goal than owning the most stuff when you die?

Shouldn't we want to have these conversations? 
Shouldn't we be given the opportunity to be curious about our origins, without feeling the need to kill people for disagreeing? 
Aren't we tired of being pushed into a mould to fit a society that takes its inhabitans existence for granted? 

Just a thought. ","2018-12-04 15:37:43","0","2","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/a31q8o/how_about_a_serious_conversation_about_this/","True","en_tanke_bara","1747919427.8072078","our planet is dying","manual"
"a9e1kp","collapse","skeptical","Merry Collapse-mass everyone!"," “'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.'”    J.R.R.Tolkien    

Today is Christmas day. A day that, as a child, filled me with a profound sense of wonder and excitement, (yes mainly because of childish ignorance and the presents) but also because everyone else around me in my family and culture had that same feeling, and like so much of the human experience, it was infectious. A collective agreement that this day, beyond all others, was something to get exited about. 

As I became older of course the excitement and wonder dulled, replaced by cynicism concerning the rabid commercialism that Christmas had become synonymous with, like a parasite consuming its host, leaving a void that turned the whole Christmas period into a most depressing affair. The extra joviality that is all but forced down your throat added to creating a sense that this was all a sick joke performed by the insane. A true nightmarish situation that led to many an arguments and countless hours of depressive self isolation. Not to mention the drinking that one year led to breaking both heels.

This trend looked only likely to continue, and worsen, especially with the solidifying knowledge of the coming collapse. Like a fast growing number of our planets inhabitants I was in the full throws of Climate Grief. Something I can say to be by far the worst sickness I have ever experienced. The anger, the anxiety,  the relentless depression, the complete loss of hope in all aspects of life. A place that I'm sure many reading this find themselves in, where the past becomes a foolish waste, the present becomes a distasteful joke, and the future holds only pain, disappointment, and chaos.       


First of all dear reader, I would like you to know that, if you do find these sentiments ring true with you, then you are right. You are absolutely right to think and feel these things, anyone that tells you otherwise clearly has no grasp on reality or the human condition. Everything that we have ever known, the comforts and distractions, the traditions and trappings, running water, electricity, healthcare, food delivered to your door, will at some point, be it a year or a decade, dissolve like the snow upon the mountain. Replaced by, well nothing. To pretend otherwise is to be content with a disconnect, a virtual reality akin to a blind religion. 

Like a 60 year old life long smoker, we have been given a death sentence, an undetermined amount of time, the bill, and shown the door. 

So, with all this being said, having accepted our fate, that no concrete bunker will suffice, no miracle science will present itself, and the intergalactic council simply doesn't have room or the patience for any more self harming migrants, what is there to be happy for, or even just contented about this time of year?

Well, dear reader, last year I would have given up right there. Sunken into the deep pit of despair that had become so familiar and comforting, hit the bottle and driven the screws further inwards in self destruction and self harm. Stoic in my surety of the future, armed with unshakable facts, armored by thick layers of statistics, riding high on the coat-tails of the four horsemen as they circle overhead, waiting patiently to land. 

But, somehow, something, somewhere inside me has changed. Or perhaps a more appropriate word would be, evolved. 

After four years of obsessive, uncontrollable, soul-sucking, nauseating, inconsolable Collapse Fatigue, there is only one real conclusion that I find myself left with. Something so obvious that it seems silly to commit it to a forum, especially one such as this. But the fact remains...  


Change is the only universal constant. 

The fear that has gripped me so relentlessly is that of my own mortality.

I project that mortality outwards onto countries, empires, technology, species, the ecosystem of planet Earth itself, and whilst it is clear that their destruction shall come to pass, and within my lifetime no doubt, the option of all these things being preserved was never on the cards. 

What difference does it make if I die in 50 years in comfort, or in 10 years along with the rest of my species, or tomorrow crossing the road? Why fear the inevitable? 

Perhaps we give humanity a little too much credit, expecting the imperfect to be capable of the sublime. A human species without greed, cruelty, ignorance, and violence would be blissful indeed, but would it still be the Human species? Of course these may all simply be symptoms of our modernization, but all I have is the experience my short time has given me, and a dream of utopia doesn't last long when presented with modern reality.    

I have a loving family around me, something I realize I am profoundly lucky to be able to say. A family that for almost three decades, I honestly didn't seem to notice. Taking it so much for granted that it had completely melted into the background of a anxious and self interested life. Now however, its like they are suddenly in HD. Soon they will be gone, and so now they burn bright.

Maybe its simply age that brings with it a certain appreciation and understanding, but acceptance of mortality and the finite nature of all things seems to have offered a helping hand. Stranger still, would I have found this kind of appreciation if it hadn't been for the coming collapse? would I have spent my life in blissful ignorance, wasting the days slaving away until suddenly, poof, gone. With perhaps only a brief moment to look back and go, fuck...    


For those that go without this luxury however, for those alone this Christmas, and any other of the 365 days we have decided don't mean quite as much for some ridiculous reason, consider this. 

Your knowledge makes you powerful, but to obsess over it, like anything done in excess, is harmful. You are, as of now, in a far better position than the majority around you. By understanding and accepting the coming reality you won't be as blindsided when it arrives. Perhaps you will even have gained skills to help out a little when the wave finally hits. But then maybe it will topple us all just the same and in which case, so what? If anything that seems fair. 

One of the most thought provoking things I have ever seen is a video of the 2004 boxing day tsunami. As the wave gets ever closer to the shore, there is a single man, laying on his surfboard, on the now deserted beach, waiting patiently. 

To my mind there where three possibilities as to why this man decided to remain.    

One: He was completely ignorant to what was about to happen, and so died as casual as he lived.      

Two: He truly believed that he could overcome the coming disaster and died fighting against the odds, his destiny his own.

Three: He had accepted his fate, and died laying on a beach he enjoyed, above his surfboard he held dear, free from denial.

\*it is of course possible his actions arose from shear panic but that rather spoils the analogy\*

I like to think It was the third option even though that is possibly the least likely, and would love to believe I could do the same, although only time will tell. But for now, the romanticism is a comfort. 

Another such comfort is the fate that will befall the 1%. Yes it is possible that some might have even some semblance of ease and normality in their fortified concrete mansions if they happen to get to them in time, but that's when it really gets good...

Imagine if you will dear reader, the grandeur, the marble tabletops, the oak paneling, the furs and paintings, the sofas and silverware, the luxury's beyond anything we could even conceive of. Now, think on how not a single one of those things matters in the slightest. Not just from a practical standpoint, but to the ignorant bastards themselves. So used to these luxuries that they no longer mean anything, so all that's changed is they have lost all freedom and hope. 

Locked inside their own golden tombs, slowly going insane from boredom and withdrawal, terrified that they might be discovered and ripped from their shell like an oyster, just a mouthful in the eyes of a predator. In fact its something I do dearly wish someone would make into a film. The blurb would go something like this: 

The family of a billionaire politician is forced into their luxury survival bunker when society collapses. At first they retain a certain amount of normality, but once the DVD selection has been watched and re-watched, the jigsaws completed and the drugs and alcohol consumed, they soon begin to loose their happy family demeanor, and their grip on reality itself. They slowly descend into madness, despair, incest, and eventually inhumanity, all without ever being able to accept the fact that they are primarily responsible for their predicament. 

It gives me a little shiver of excitement it really does, the sweet justice of it all. Tis a dream its true, and might not play out that way at all, but it's my dream, and provides no end of comfort. 

All these things combined, left to stew for a time, simmering with anger, distilling in despair, seasoned with bargaining, topped of with the last shreds of denial, *eventually* comes out as freshly baked acceptance, although you need to remake it every day to keep it fresh. Strange analogy I know but there's Christmas dinner being prepared in the background and it seems to be sinking in to my subconscious...         


After coming to hate Christmas over the last few years, I am fortunate enough to have found new meaning in it. Through my acceptance of our apocalyptic future, wonderful new appreciation of the present because of it, incredible fortune to be with a caring family and perhaps just getting bored with my inner Grinch.  

I may well be the first one to die as the wave of collapse reaches the shore, but so what? It was going to happen eventually, and actually, you have to admit that in a way, this is all very exiting isn't it? I mean if I had been given the choice of when to visit humanity, I would probably have chosen the most insane, hectic, Grimdark bit. So bring on the Collapse! I'm sitting on my surf board on this soon to be deserted beach, drink in hand, waiting patiently. Unless of course... it doesn't bloody happen fast enough >.<

Everyone just needs to realize these peoples best interest is not the same as ours. We are all worried about life, family, bills, real stuff. These people who really run the show have one agenda and one agenda only, KEEP US MALLEABLE AND CALM. You can't really think that they would tell us the full story, could you? They just need to keep us calm just long enough so when the time comes, They can make their escape while the 99% of us normal people are running around like chickens with our heads cut off.

Humans are disgusting. Humans contaminate and pollute without respect for the planet. Humans create stupid divisive ideals like capitalism and socialism (both are stupid in the end). And the worst thing is that humans have reduced themselves to breeders overpopulating our planet and they keep doing it.

Quite frankly, collapse is the best thing that could happen. Humans need to disappear forever. What humans have done to nature is shameful. Humans are selfish and because of this humans need to disappear. 

Oh, and I recently read about the rich and their bunkers. Bitch, please. It might buy you a few more years (likely only a few more weeks) but you're gonna die anyway. No, there won't be a colonization of Mars.

"a3ncoy","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I'm disappointed in my BF's family","I (29F) found out last night that my boyfriend's (28M) family is going to another state for Xmas and I am so disappointed in them.

 Backstory: My boyfriend and i have been together for about 7 years and I have always been a little wary of his family due to some of their actions in the past. In the beginning we used to spend tons of time over there (usually at my request) because they live so close and I have always thought that we should spend time with the people we love while they are here. Thru the years I have become more distant. This is primarily because I have found that our values do not line up. I think time and effort spent is the most important component to a relationship and I feel as though they put a higher price on things than they do time. Despite this I have went to each holiday to be apart of the family and support my boyfriend. Last year my boyfriend's mother died before Christmas. It was awful. We all sat around on Christmas feeling lost and unsure. We all said ""Next year will be better!"" and gave it an honest try. For the first 6 months of the year we had dinner every Sunday at my house. The invitation is standing that at 7 pm we eat and talk about our weeks, lives and hopes. Those first few months we had never been closer. Things changed when my boyfriend's father got a new GF. He stopped coming around, got moody and never seemed to want to hear from us. It has been a tough year so we all just kind of accepted it as a phase and hoped things would turn around. Dinner still happens each Sunday but now only my boyfriends brother comes. The sister and father just kind of dropped off the face of the planet. I started to focus more on my family as I feel like I have been neglecting them; during holidays especially; as we spent so much time with his family while his mom was sick. This Thanksgiving I spent driving around to all my family and some of my boyfriends family so that we could all be together even if our time was brief. This meant we didnt spend all day with his family and we didnt cook the meal as we have been doing of late.

Present: Last night we found out from his sister that she, her dad and her brother are all driving to another state and spending the holiday there. My boyfriend and I just kind of shared a look and said that sounds nice. We didnt know what to say. I mean ""this year will be better!"", right? But neither of us can go because of our jobs. SO now I am sitting here trying to find a way to make this Christmas not be the worst one since his mom died. His whole family is leaving with absolutely no consideration if HE can go. I dont mind staying home as my family is here but he has to stay because of his job and now he is forced to spend his second Christmas without his mom or his family. I know my family will love to have him (they adore him) and it will be nice and we have eachother but it breaks my heart to think that he isnt even a factor for them in this decision. If I ask him he will say that its ok and that we will be together; which is true; but i just think its not the same. As if we didnt already feel the strain of the relationship with them due to the past few months this really spoke volumes to me. The sister assured me we would get together the weekend before to exchange gifts. That made me even more sad and furthered my assumption that money and gifts mean more than time spent together. I just feel so lost and unsure of how to make things seem better. More than anything I want his mom back.

"a2sd6s","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","Committed to Committing Suicide","Throwaway because I don't want this to be associated with my main account.  


I've known for certain that I'd commit suicide at some point in my life for quite some time now. I just don't know when. There's so many reasons for me to end my life and only a few artificial reasons to stick around. My depression is largely existential, meaning I'm not depressed because I hate myself or because I was abused, I'm depressed because I legitimately don't see a point to anything at all, and everything that was once enjoyable to me is now ruined. Every time I do something I used to like, I just think over and over ""this is just a distraction from what you should be doing"". Every time I talk about it with people I'm ignored, scrutinized, or fed complete lies to keep me from doing something ""irrational"". I've stopped talking about my suicidal thoughts because everyone just tells me something I've already thought about a thousand times over. I know what my worth is, but nobody else does. I know I'm incredibly gifted and talented, and I love to create, but what's the point in creating if nobody sees the same value that I do? What's the point in doing ANYTHING (college, relationships, etc.) if we're all going to be thrusted into a world that actively seeks to destroy good people? The world is literally on fire and nobody is doing anything to put it out. We have a system in place that is so ingrained in our minds that we're actually engineering our own demise and think that it's somehow good for us. We can't control our urges, and often encourage others to ""live in the moment"" and ""chase life"", when in reality that does far more harm than good. We should be living for the future, because we have such little time left before billions of people are displaced by climate change. I want to die because I don't want to die later at the hands of something I know I could've prevented if given the platform and power. There's a thousand reasons to want to die right now, and the only reasons people tell me not to are because they want me to suffer for the sake of me being in their lives as a background character. It's sad when good intentioned people can't convince someone not to commit suicide. There have been so many red alarms that people should wake the fuck up and realize that nothing is working, but everyone just goes back on their phones and goes back to work and completely ignores what should be done. Nobody can rebel and erect change because everyone is completely dependent on their jobs, on money, and on drugs to cope with our shitty existence. We all deserve to die, and we all will one way or another. We are the greatest parasite this planet has ever seen and it seems like the only thing we can do is continue to get worse. I've completely given up on trying to convince people that the problems we are all facing are so incredibly urgent that it requires the entire way the world works to completely stop. We're out of control, and I don't think we'll be able to stop the inevitable from happening. I think when they look at our ruins thousands of years from now, they'll be glad we're gone and no longer able to destroy all the good in the world. Either that or evil will outright win and dominate forever. I have no faith or no hope left to offer, I only crave death like you all crave your materialistic possessions. There is no redemption for the human race, nor should there be. I wish someone would just kill me in an alley so that I don't have to humiliatingly do it myself. Fuck this. Fuck life. It's more of a curse than a gift. Existence is pain. Pure pain.","2018-12-03 20:03:20","1","3","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/a2sd6s/committed_to_committing_suicide/","True","throwitallaway0206","1747920390.608001","our planet is dying","manual"

You could still enjoy your meat (if you're a die-hard meat-eater) and be vegan at the same time. No animals killed/exploited, no huge amounts of land being cleared and used up, cleaner meat free of antibiotics, disease, bad energy, etc. Animal agriculture would be inexcusable/intolerable at that point. Personally I've been vegan for 3 years and am 20 now and 15 year old me would die if I couldn't have animal products, so I see why its hard for people to see how amazing the diet/lifestyle is from the other side (especially your first few months as a new vegan when you're getting around the bend, but then realize how good you feel and never go back).
