"d26jfab","t3_4f67he","4f67he","collapse","skeptical","In many ways I completely agree with you, but when you start talking about the extinction of modern humans (as opposed to massive population reduction) for the sake of the rest of the biodiversity on this planet, an important point needs to be made that I rarely see brought up: if all (non-indigenous, as you say) humans die, what happens to all the stored nuclear material which we maintain? Without constant monitoring, control and upkeep, all the spent radioactive waste sitting around being kept stable suddenly starts to degrade. If/when humans are no longer around to maintain it, it all suddenly becomes a huge, ticking time bomb which threatens all the rest of the species on this planet. 

Until I came to this realization, I'd always taken comfort in the idea that the biodiversity on earth is so long-lasting and established that, if we were to remove humans from the equation, life would theoretically bounce back to some sort of equilibrium. The reality, however, is that we have created an enormous, global nuclear bomb of sorts with a pressure switch that our species holds down. If we all die, that switch gets released. For better or (almost certainly) worse, we have taken long-term stewardship of this planet into our own hands. Simply becoming extinct is the easy way out, but that nuclear material won't disappear with us and, without us, its existence threatens everything else still alive on this planet. Thus we are left with a responsibility for that which we created, and at least some of us must persevere for the sake of everything else.

I mean, I guess if we focus purely on survival, the tardigrade is the most successful organism, possibly. 

The purpose of life is to propagate life. To these ends, the lion evolved it's claws, the turtle evolved it's shell, the giraffe evolved it's neck. Eventually, purely through random mutation, the rubics cube of DNa was bound to grant some organism an extra boost of intelligence. Intelligence appears to have survival value, and so  intelligent monkeys are more likely to mate with intelligent monkeys. 

We are nothing more than intelligent monkeys. At the same time, we are the most intelligent beings that we know of. I do not know if I believe in gods; I do know there are some alternate bibles, the Nag Hammadi. In one of the texts, (Untitled) On the Origin of the World, the myth of Genesis is told from a different point of view. In this version, god is jealous of man; he sees that man is the only creature that has it within him to become as the gods. So he throws man out of paradise, makes him mortal. 

If you do believe in gods, perhaps man really is capable of becoming as gods. Perhaps, man must continue to evolve, in order to become as gods, in order to create the universe. Maybe if someone created a virus that killed all men, we would cease to exist, and without us there is no god; and since there is no god the universe never existed, retroactively, and so this conversation hasn't actually happened. 

I think that if human life does not matter, then life on this planet does not matter. If life on this planet does not matter, we should find ways to survive, even if it threatens the life of the planet. We are killing the planet, and if we succeed, we kill ourselves; I believe this. Never the less, we are in this to the bitter end, and so am I. I'm curious to see what comes next. 

You are not yet a god. No man should have the authority to end mankind; we live in an age when it may be possible for a single man to do it.

"d22g3o8","t3_4eq4bn","4eq4bn","conservation","scientific","You're shouting a philosophical question into an arena of people who have answered the question long before you asked.

Regardless, my experience with conservation may help answer your thoughts. The Earth, as a habitat, has a baseline. The climate and ecosystem have various ranges that are all well within the habitable range for the human species. Conservation could be translated to,""maintaining normal variations while reducing human impact."" That is to say, the best method of conserving nature in general is genocide of the human species. We are the largest negatively contributing factor. However, human life is sacred to us and put as the highest priority thus creating a paradox in which the best solution for the environment has the worst outcome for us. We compensate by reducing our footprint on the environment and not slaughtering billions (oh well).

As far as the cute fluffy polar bear? Indicative. When one species begin to die, the ecosystem changes. One species triggers an imbalance that nature will resolve. The problem about that resolution is that it's outside of human control. When we no longer have a say in the fate of our species, survival mode kicks in. We don't want survival mode because it will be violent and scary, trust me.

The goal of conservation isn't to conserve the environment a lot of the time. Think about the bigger picture. We're conserving the optimally habitable range of variation for human life. It's a method of self-preservation in itself. ","2016-04-14 11:53:54","4","ObiWonKaTobey","1747862034.5459032","our planet is dying","manual"

"d22j881","t3_4eq4bn","4eq4bn","conservation","scientific","I don't think you will find people on this sub saying that conservation isn't important. I suppose in different subreddits you may get different answers.

Before I answer, I would deconstruct a few assumptions you appear to make in your question:

First, I question the need to think of humans as separate from the rest of life on this planet. I understand why we're in the habit of doing this in our everyday lives, and for many issues it makes plenty of sense. For example, I'm generally sympathetic to animal welfare, but I would stop short of saying that chickens and humans deserve the same rights. But in a more broad sense, humans, and any other organism here, have the same rights to call this planet home and we all depend upon it for all our needs. We all evolved here and were shaped by natural processes here. So, I believe it helps us to think of humans as a part of our ecosystems, rather than just outside actors. This isn't meant to be some kind of hippie-dippie back-to-the-trees kumbaya nonsense, but to guard against thinking of ourselves as total outsiders to natural ecosystems and processes.

Second, and this ties into the previous issue, I would question the importance of conserving any specific species in a vacuum. It's difficult to guess the implications of any one species going extinct and how wild areas bounce back. Take the near extinction of American Chestnut for example. This was a sizeable component of eastern North American forests with hundreds of different animal species dependent on it for food, habitat, etc. Now it's pretty much gone, but the forests here rebounded with oaks and hickories replacing the chestnut. It's simply very hard to predict what happens in the event of an extinction (or near-extinction in this case). Perhaps we got lucky, but maybe we won't be in the future.

So my point is generally this: Conservation need to be broad. We have to do more than just save large charismatic animals, and instead conserve large swaths of land (and water) more-or-less intact (see E.O. Wilson's latest book for more on this) to stave off extinctions. This will, I hope, also be a tool in fighting climate change. Many models scientists have put together suggest that native ranges for many animals and plants will shift if climate shifts continue. If we have plenty of land in conservation than those habitat changes can occur -- animals will be able to migrate uninterrupted, seeds will find themselves landing in suitable habitat, etc -- if not, then we risk extirpation or extinction for these species as they fail to find new suitable habitat because they are isolated by human development and disturbance.

Conservation is also in our best interests. Humans depend far more on ecosystem services than the average person knows. We take crop pollination for granted, but a rough estimate of its value, just in the US, is around $29 billion per year (http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/05/insect-pollinators-contribute-29b-us-farm-income). You can add to that all sorts of other things wild areas do for us that have real economic benefits such as wetlands mitigating storm/flooding damage (estimated to be $13 billion in value per year in the US http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/intro/value/) , sand dunes retaining vulnerable soils near valuable real estate, beneficial insects living in refugia helping to reduce dependence on pesticides. Look at the landslides and dropping water tables in Haiti, which I've seen first-hand, as a result of rampant deforestation. Consider the value of ecosystems that we need to function in order to hunt or fish from them (According to FAO, total value of all fish caught in a year is over $200 billion). This is before even considering the economic benefits of tourism to neighboring communities, and intangible benefits of simply being able to enjoy natural areas.

Look closely at the list above though and you'll notice that many of those economic benefits of conservation aren't tied to any given species, but to the function of an entire ecosystem. And this gets back to your question about protecting individual species. In many cases we don't know which or how many species we can let go extinct from any given ecosystem before the whole thing starts to fall apart and we can't reap those benefits any more. Many of the ecologists I know and work with say that the concept of a ""keystone species"" may be an outdated view. That ecosystems don't necessarily depend on just a few vital actors with everyone else playing background roles, but that as more and more species get removed, we weaken the entire ecosystem. If these changes to abiotic factors and removal of living species happens too quickly, there may not be enough time for natural systems to adapt and continue the functions that we depend on. So even a an anthropocentric viewpoint leads us to conservation as a precautionary measure to make sure we can continue to exploit natural systems.

I won't argue that every species needs to be conserved. A number of people have argued in favor of letting pandas go extinct. I'm hardly an expert, but the arguments they make sound compelling. Chances are that a handful of remaining rhinos aren't ecologically significant (again I don't know, I'm speculating). But they serve as important mascots and if we protect them in situ, instead of or in addition to in zoos, then we are working to conserve a much broader array of species and the rhino serves as a valuable mascot.

To get slightly off track, there seems to be a real futurist bent on Reddit. Personally, I don't know if we're going to start colonizing other planets or not, but even if we do, that doesn't reduce the need to conserve, instead it amplifies it. If we want to, say, terraform Mars we're going to need plants and fungi to do it. And we're going to have to pick from the palette of organisms here on Earth to achieve that. If we've destroyed wild areas, and let many thousands more species go extinct then we have fewer options to work with and success will be more difficult. The point I made about humans not existing in a vacuum, but as part of a system of interdependence on other species will still be true too, it will just be a different set of species on which we depend upon. But I imagine, even if humans become some sci-fi galaxy conquering race, we'll still need to depend on services that other living organisms provide.

Sorry, that was a lot of words. I hope that helps though!

Edit: What we can do is try to get across how real this is, they likely wouldn't stand there laughing while somebody kills a pig next to them but it seems very far away for them","2016-04-20 14:00:16","2","QwertzWins","1747862670.375783","our planet is dying","manual"

Long long ago,there was a lonely old man,he collected firewood at mountain and sell them for his live.he was kind and poor.one day he at mountain as usual,suddenly he heard some noise near him.he came forward and saw a hawk grabbed a golden snake.he pity that little golden snake then throw his axe to the hawk , the hawk was scared and flied away and left the golden snake.the old man got close to the snake and wanted to save the golden snake. the snake start talk suddenly:""thank you, I'm the prince of dragon,my power has lost because I off water too long.please put me into a river.and I will reward you.""then the old man did it by the snake's wish.and the snake then turn into a handsome prince when he touch the water. the prince asked the old man:what is your wish,gold or pretty girl?I can give all you want for pay what you have done to me.
the old man said:I'm too old,gold and gold is not use for me.could you make me youth again?
the prince thought a while and said:come close to me,I will fulfill my promise.then put his hand on the old man's head.the old man felt a hot stream through the top down to the foot.and it's too hot to tolerant.he then passed out with a yell.it's night when he woke up.he opened his eyes found no one around him,he didn’t know what happened just before.then he tried to find a way in the dark to go home.he feel his eye is very clear and his body is very strong.the next day morning he found he became a very handsome young guy by the reflection on the basin when he washed his face.he get into his yard and lift a millstone easily.so the ""old man""join the army of his country and got a lot of credit from battles.finally he was a general of his country and the story has a happy ending.
1.So this is a normal story and I think many culture has this kind of story.we all think the old man is the young general.
2.if I use my theory to explain of what the prince have done to the old man,it will look like reasonable and science.the truth is the prince killed the old man and took his memory out then put it into a body of the prince's warrior（clear the warrior's memory before).
3.no one know the processing so we all think the ""two"" man still be the same guy.even the old man.just the prince know the truth.so this is the feeling of read&write our memory.not so weird and uncomfortable.","2016-04-15 13:49:33","1","puzzlerch","1747862747.571813","our planet is dying","manual"
