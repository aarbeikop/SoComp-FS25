Wildlife simply does not exist without being affected and molested by human existence. 

Those of our species who fight, fight with urgency because we feel we are losing the *real* world. We feel we are losing the world as it would be without us, and if it would be wild and natural without us exploiting it, than that must be what it really should be.

The last places where one can even glimpse at this ancient *real* world are reserves like the Okavango Delta, little more than gated communities that we set aside. The rest of nature is living on the fringes. 

150-200 plants, insects, birds, and mammals go extinct **EVERYDAY**. That is 1,000 times the natural extinction rate. This life should *not* be disappearing. How can we even begin to tell ourselves we're helping when a weekend goes by and 300 species vanish forever?

We kill 56 billion (56,000,000,000) animals for meat consumption a year. Thats 155 million (155,000,000) *a day*. Not including the marine life which is in such massive quantities we measure it in tons.
We love our meat. We domesticate and dominate wildlife so we can bend it to best serve our wants and desire for profit.

Why is all of this so unstoppable? Why is it all at such massive and incomprehensible scales? Population. 360,000 people are born everyday. 151,000 die. That leaves 209,000 people added to the Earth everyday. 

How many elephants are added to the Earth everyday? How many red wood trees? Our species keeps growing, and every other species disappears, one by one. The ones we like best we try and make stick around a little longer. The exciting African fauna. But eventually, they too will falter. Eventually it will just be us and our livestock will make up the vast majority of organisms on this planet, while the natural world and all of its complexity, its landscapes, its energy, will be but a glimmer. 

This is what the human race has done in just 500 generations. This is not doomsday speak, but the truth. The numbers are there. The natural world is not being saved. Us environmentalists are looking at a burning city and going to each building and tossing a bucket of water on it. In the end, we can't stop the positive feedback loop that is this industrial civilization we live in. 

And so again I ask, what are we fighting for anymore?","2016-08-06 16:39:27","0","2","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/4wgl9j/what_are_we_fighting_for_anymore/","True","Auzaro","1747868882.5395179","our planet is dying","manual"
"4y8g3d","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","[LONG] I miss you so damn much, I wish everything was different","I don't know how or why you keep creeping back into the back of my head. Every time you do, you manage to glue yourself onto my brain and stay there for such a long time, making me miserable, uncertain and convince me that I have a big hole in my heart which only you can fill. Slowly taking over my thoughts, showing me a world where I am - *we are* - happy and daily questioning of my existing does not occur. Then you wake me up, making me longing for *the* unreachable, something nostalgic, something *perfect* - something we could have, maybe something we would've had.

You're the *worst* thing that ever happened to me. Not even my mentally abusive father or my lonesome upbringing where I had to fight rejections and bullying from those who were supposed to be my class mates can compare. That I can deal with. I cut ties with my father and my life has improved immensely. I've been to shrink after shrink, and still am, to help me improve my self-esteem (or lack thereof) and deal with depression and social phobia. I even take medications to overcome even the most trivial challenges, but I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But *you*. I don't know how to deal with you. You somehow block the light and the path, forcing me to go backwards. 

And the worst thing? You *never* did anything wrong. My situation is not your fault. Never have, never will. We were teenagers when we met; I fell in love instantly. In my lonely time in school I rebelled; I was treated like I was from another planet, I might as well act like I was. I broke the chains of fitting-in with the norm. That's when we met, you saw my true self. You liked what you saw. You showed me respect. You cared for me. You *loved* me. My memories are cloudy and I fail to remember most of my childhood, even my youth. The time with you, however, is chiseled in granite. I remember it. I remember it clearly. I was a mess emotionally though. I fucked up and ended the relationship with you. I was teenager, so it was a bullshit reason - I vaguely remember it, but it was probably because you wanted to be like everyone else. I don't fucking know, we were teenagers. 

If I had a time machine and could travel back and redo decisions in my life, I can only think of two occurrences in my life I would change. Both of these would have major impact on my current life and I wouldn't be sitting here. If I could, I'd tell myself never stop doing sports - and enjoy the time with the peers who accepted me and a trainer who was a better parent for me than my real father or mother ever had been. He supported me, he treated me like a son. When I could no longer train under him, it was devastating. Like my whole life, I once again felt lonely, rejected. I was let down. And now it's too late to tell him how much I appreciated our relationship, because he died 2 years ago. But first and foremost, if I could travel back in time, I would never end my relationship with you. 

We have chatted a bit online on and off ever since the break-up. Even years after. I always wanted you back, and I'm pretty sure you knew that. But you never did want me back, or so it seemed. I remember a night distinctly where you said no. I was broken. I remember staying at couple of friends, where I met a new girl. Thinking back, I don't remember if I flirted with her because of your rejections or because I just liked her. Or both. Never the less, me and her started our relationship. We've been together ever since. 8 years. 

... And here I sit, in front of my computer, on Reddit, crying. Listening to music brings me back to my teenage years. I don't know why I torture myself like this, but I can't stop. I need to let out my feelings, I need to put words on it. It's difficult. Somehow I feel numb, but at the same time I am overwhelmed by feelings. Days are passing by, people live their lives. You live your life. I live my. But you somehow came back. It's not the first time. But this time seems different. You've been in my head far longer than ever before. When I close my eyes, I see you. When I open my eyes, I see you. I don't know how or why. 

I have a significant other. You have a significant other. We have our separate lives. But I'm not sure if this is the life I want. But I don't know you anymore. It's been over 10 years since we were together. 10 fucking years and you still make me feel empty inside, because you're not in my arms. It's frustrating. I don't know how to deal with this. 

My conclusion is my only way out of this is to meet you again. But we haven't talked in the last 3-4 years now. I'm going to a concert in your city next month and I secretly hope you show up, but I only set myself up for disappointment. It's your birthday soon, I want to congratulate you, but I also feel that is very inappropriate. Actually, I lied about the 3-4 years. It's actually only a couple of months since we talked over the phone. But that was not voluntarily. It was part of your job at the union to call me, what are the odds, right? You knew it was me, but I was unaware until I saw your name in the mail you wrote me afterwards as a follow-up to our conversation. 

Fuck this text is getting long. I'm just ranting. If you read it all, thank you. It was needed to get it out of my head, I will now descend into the darkness and once again meet you in my dreams. I truly miss you. I truly do.

TL;DR - Missing my ex from my teenage years who keep creeping back into my head.

"4y0o7d","vegan","unknown","Another example of Hypocrisy, or ""I don't see how I'm the problem"" RANT","So I am a master's student studying Environmental Biology at a relatively large university. The majority of our classes and research projects are conservation based, and we all know the extent of the destruction caused by the meat and fishing industries. My classmates share articles on how humans are ruining the planet, how we must preserve our ocean, yadda yadda yadda, and yet the vast majority of them are omni. So what I don't understand is, how can they all preach about how our planet is dying and something must be done, and yet don't take any actions to do this themselves? I had a friend who is doing his project on coral reefs insult a boat of fishermen (not to their face of course) for fishing in an area of the beach we were doing data collection at, and yet he eats seafood multiple times a week. How do they think they are better than others? What are they doing any differently than every other person? Studying conservation is all good and well, but how can they care about something so much they dedicate their life to it, and yet continue to contribute to the problem. You can write as many papers on overfishing as you want, but if you continue to eat fish, you're just being a hypocrite. Do they just expect everyone else to do it for them? It just baffles me how even in a conservation and environment based (masters!) program the disconnect is still so rampant.
