Do you think this will be effective in helping others change? I've been vegan for 12+years now, and the way I do outreach has changed. Heck, it changes from person to person.

I'm not saying to hide or downplay your veganism, but do what is best for the animals. ","2015-02-04 17:26:48","25","pinkrayzen","1747837960.3154418","our planet is dying","manual"
"cob9ow7","t3_2urngt","2urngt","vegan","unknown","When people feel personally attacked, they get angry and shut you out. The vegan stereotype is that vegans have a sense of self-righteousness and think they are better than everyone else because they don't eat or buy animal products. A by-product of this ""self-righteous"" attitude is the need to make a difference... or tell everyone who isn't vegan that they are wrong and should change their ways. This is a major turn off for most people and will never get through to them.

Let me put it to you like this: Let's say a religious nutcase came along (you know the kind... religious T-shirt, carrying the Holy Book because they feel incomplete without it?). Say they immediately jumped at the opportunity to tell you that there is eternal torment waiting for you if you don't immediately accept their deity as the one true God. You would feel pretty put off by this and try to distance yourself from this person, would you not? 

Now, following this same example, lets say a person, completely nondescript, came along and got to know you. You two become friends, even. Say a couple weeks later they invite you to some sort of meet-up for their religion. You decline, because you aren't religious, and they don't push it. Another week goes by and you get another invitation. After a while, you start to warm up to the idea and maybe give it a go. A couple months later and you are a regular at said religious gathering.

The difference between these two is that the first one completely attacks your character. They call you a terrible person and tell you that you need to change your ways. It doesn't matter what that person says at that point because you are already backing away from them as quickly as you can. The second one, however, doesn't attack you at all. They only want to make you feel included. They present the opportunity for change and allow you to make the decision to take action. 

This same thing should be done in veganism. You are not going to change anyone by making them feel personally attacked or comparing them to a serial killer by eating meat. A much more tactful way to handle the situation would be to befriend people and slowly show them what it means to be vegan. Instead of posting a status that personally attacks the character of everyone on your friends list, you should abstain, at all costs, from attacking someones lifestyle. You'll get nowhere that way.","2015-02-04 20:49:43","10","[deleted]","1747837960.323349","our planet is dying","manual"

"cob8cm2","t3_2urngt","2urngt","vegan","unknown","Being combative like this is not going to change minds. Creating an open environment for healthy dialogue is the best way. Saying things like ""This is why I chose to be vegan.."" instead of ""How can you keep condemning animals to be MURDERED?"" is probably much more effective. The former is more inviting to learn about veganism whereas the latter is more apt to immediately raise peoples' defenses.

One of my friends is very anti-government and posts lots of eye-opening photos and links about that topic. Some of them venture into the conspiracy territory, but others are really valid and eye opening. Instead of throwing up mean comments about it, the way he just shares a link instead creates a more open environment for me to read it and form my own opinion.

You have to understand that not everyone sees life through your same lens. I have a friend who grew up on a farm. Killing animals is nothing to him. He doesn't view them as living, breathing, thoughtful, emotional creatures. He sees them as sources of meat, and no amount of evidence is going to convince him otherwise. Trying to force my viewpoint to take over his is not going to work and is frankly insulting. How would you feel if you're gay and a religious person comes screaming in your face that what you're doing is an abomination to God and that you're going to burn in hell forever? Good intentions in both cases, but neither one is going to be effective and will likely hurt your relationship with them.

The other part of this is that people use social media differently. If you want to use it as a platform to blast your opinion out about animal rights, you can do that. Other people who use Faceboook as a way to communicate with friends and provide updates on their life may not like the way you are using Facebook. You have the right to do whatever you want on your Facebook just like they have the right to eat as much meat as they want. If you don't like what they're saying, you can go ahead and keep posting. If they don't like what you're saying, they can go eat a hamburger.","2015-02-04 20:15:33","3","SoupyWolfy","1747837960.351136","our planet is dying","manual"

"cobhvle","t3_2urngt","2urngt","vegan","unknown","In my mind, there are two paths to take here:

(A) Continue to use every avenue available to you, including your social media accounts, to preach the gospel of veganism. Prepare to lose friends and alienate people in the name of your calling.

(B) Practice veganism quietly, privately, and proudly, with the understanding that you have done your part, and hopefully set a good example for those who would notice.

The same could be said for anyone passionate about politics or religion. There are those who keep their beliefs to themselves, and those who try to impress them upon the world.

Not for me to say which one is right. I personally choose (B) - I'll do what I do, and try to set a good example, quietly. But, it takes all kinds. You might be more of an (A) person. That's fine if that's the case, but the cost of that choice is that same cost paid by anyone else with a calling - you WILL lose friends.

"cobukp4","t3_2urngt","2urngt","vegan","unknown","Since you say you post pics... 

I have a rule for myself and a polite request to other activists I know. No gore on my newsfeed. A link to it *without* a preview and *with* a warning is one thing, but if you're posting gore that is going to just be popping up in people's newsfeeds then I think 1. it's really inconsiderate to people who may not be in a good frame of mind to look at it (very ableist, fyi) and 2. it's a dumbass move because it will end up alienating exactly the sort of people who do care (including those who are already vegan). You lose your platform them when you betray the trust of those that friend you assuming that you're not going to post something visually disturbing. You will be unfollowed, and often unfriended. That shouldn't be a point of pride if the idea is to get the message out. You're not edgy, you're just annoying. 

So, instead, post links, without previews and with warnings. I've recommended Earthlings to some people on FB and warned them it was tough to watch. And they were grateful for the warning and still chose to watch it and were more receptive, I bet, because of that. 

Engage people in thoughtful discussions. Post stuff about how awesome it is to eat/use vegan products if you don't mind that sort of thing. Personally, I've found it's an easy way to get people to try new things and see that being vegan doesn't have to be hard. And, hell, even if they switch from a non-vegan product to a vegan one or try a vegan restaurant, that means animals are spared. It's not about censoring the idea that veganism is about animals. Keep it about the animals, absolutely. But be smart about it and you'll have a bigger impact while still being true to your ideals.

There could be billions of intelligent ET life out there that are ahead of our time.

There could, but we have no idea on how rare life is and (more relevant) how rare intelligent life is. Even with the incredible vastness of the universe it's not impossible that we really are an exception. (I don't necessarily think we are, but it's worth keeping in the back of our minds.)

> At the same time, we got political conflict and escalations with a constant threat of annihilation if a nuclear war were to begin.

I don't think that *right now* the situation is such that a war going nuclear would be an extinction event. Unlike during the Cold War, there's no-one going around (realistically) threatening mutually assured destruction. I hope nukes will never be used again (except to propel spaceships, maybe), but if they are I'm not convinced it'll automatically mean human extinction. (But they can and we should put some effort in preventing it, that's for sure.)

> Along with that, we are becoming overpopulated as a species

As I said earlier this week in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2ukf61/the_problem_of_overpopulation/), I remain unconvinced that overpopulation is going to be a major problem any time soon IF we can solve other important problems. Overpopulation is a resource issue, and we're not using all the resources we have available to their maximum efficiency.

> Electric cars cause more damage to our environment then gas guzzlers, so not a solution

They *currently* cause more damage. If more pressure is created against the use of fossil fuels in industry, they might not do so in the future.

> Then there's climate change, which is a very real, and potentially catastrophic issue that i believe we must solve during this century, and to do that, more and more sacrifices regarding our way of living are going to need to be made starting as soon as possible.. 

I agree. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of this generation and the following ones. I don't want to be too techno-optimist about this, but I think that we need technical solutions. Changing society is slow without tech to back it up. Maybe even too slow. Humans aren't good long-term thinkers so demanding sacrifices isn't going to work. We already see this happening. Western countries don't want to change their way of life and put strain on their economies and developing countries don't want to use the (more expensive) renewable sources of energy, because they didn't create this mess. Unless the tech gets here to create growth without relying on harmful ways of creating energy, I don't see society changing all that much until it's too late.

> Think about it this way, if you were earth, and for hundreds of millions of of years, things were in general equilibrium with a balanced nature, and you were in control, till out of nowhere humans arrived and started slowly killing you off for their own benefits. Then imagine it eventually got to the point, where you're seriously dying, while the human race is increasing exponentially, and killing you at a faster and faster rate, each year while doing very little in trying to prevent much of these damages we bring upon earth. In just a few hundred years, you see how greedy and self-absorbed this species is, with little to no regard to the world that provided them with all these possibilities. Imagine how you'd feel. 

I'm not sure how useful this analogy is, because it doesn't matter. Earth can't feel, it doesn't observe us. Humans aren't killing it off. The Earth will be fine. The ecosystem might get fucked, but that's happened before and the planet did just fine. Fucking up doesn't mean Earth gets ""killed"", it means humanity gets killed or at least reduced in such a manner that we might lose most of the value we care about.

> It will be a close one, but I personally believe to really further our chances, we have to change everything from our lifestyles, to government, and our personalities. 

If you really believe this, then you probably also believe that we're already fucked. Lifestyle and governments might change, but you can't change human nature (and even if you can, I'm not convinced we should). We need to find solutions that work with human nature, not against it.

> HOW this relates to other potential intelligent civilizations is that they most likely evolved in a similar fashion we did, and hit this first precipice most likely around the same time we did in regards to how advanced we are, and that we will have our first run-on it in the near coming future.

I don't think it's as likely as you think. Some of our problems stem from the way the human mind works, and those biases and ways of thinking might not be universal. Even at the evolutionary level there are things that could prevent an intelligence species from reaching this point. On the technology level there also lots of things that could happen to prevent all this from happening. It's not hard to imagine a counterfactual history were fossil fuels are a historical oddity and renewables get used from a far earlier point.

> IMO, world peace and collaboration is a first must.

I don't think it is. If we sit around and wait for those things to happen, we'll get nowhere. We need to do shit regardless of conflicts.

There's also other criteria to consider, such as metallicity and gamma bursts, which cut down the possibilities considerably.

> There could be billions of intelligent ET life out there that are ahead of our time.

Let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still many steps between a planet with life, and a spacefaring civilization.

According to my calculations, there may be only two such civilizations (including ours) in the entire galaxy by now, though there would be many with more primitive life and civilizations.

> AS of right now, we are constantly making new discoveries at an exponential rate, and moving forward into a full digital world at an unprecedented rate.

Nope. The rate of discoveries and inventions is directly proportional to the number of researchers, the number of which grew exponentially for the last two centuries, but that growth has slowed down in first world countries. By 2050, the majority of new discoveries and inventions will come from developing countries; as their population growth slows down, so will global R&D growth.

> At the same time, we got political conflict and escalations with a constant threat of annihilation if a nuclear war were to begin.

Global thermonuclear war is unlikely, as is WW3. A few rogue states might nuke something, but don't have enough for global devastation.

> Along with that, we are becoming overpopulated as a species,

Not even close. World population is tapering off, set to peak at 11 billion in 2200.

> and although we are constantly finding more and more non-renewable fossil fuels, we will eventually run out of that too,

There is enough fossil fuels left to keep burning for hundreds of years, if we didn't mind the catastrophic climate change that would result from it.

We're already shifting to solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. We will have viable fusion power by 2030-2050, to be expanded on thereafter.

> and (Electric cars cause more damage to our environment then gas guzzlers, so not a solution).

Only so long as our electricity comes from coal.

> Then there's climate change, which is a very real, and potentially catastrophic issue that i believe we must solve during this century, and to do that, more and more sacrifices regarding our way of living are going to need to be made starting as soon as possible.. 

No human sacrifices needed. We just need to build more renewable energy infrastructure, [improve crop yields with biochar](http://extrememadscience.blogspot.ca/2013/11/biochar-buries-fossil.html), and we'll be fine.

Example: [UK 2050 model](http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/pathways/10h43111111111140312133004114340213303101302330210221/primary_energy_chart)

> IS there a second option, such as one having to do with a massive depopulation and one world order?

That's a really shitty idea, and not at all necessary.

> We couldn't live in a more interesting time.

Well that much is true. It looks like we're going to have fusion power, mars colonies, and eternal youth by the turn of the century.
