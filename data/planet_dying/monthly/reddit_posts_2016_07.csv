"4s74hi","vegan","unknown","I understand why we need to reduce our meat consumption, but is there any reason to stop eating meat entirely?","I know all of the environmental arguments about how eating meat is bad for the planet, and I agree that we should eat less meat, but there is no environmental reason to stop eating meat entirely. I'm therefore asking you : Why would I completely stop eating meat?

Before you give me answers I've already heard, here are a few usual arguments and why I don't follow them.

**If men kill animals, they'll find it easier to kill humans**
Can you give me a single proof that this is true? Human psychology is a complicated thing, you can't just make assumptions on human behaviour. Until I've seen solid scientific proof, I have no reason to believe killing animals makes you more likely to kill humans.

**eating meat causes animals to suffer**
No it doesn't. Farm animals live a cosy, comfortable life. As for when they go to the slaughterhouse, maybe it's a bit stressful, but it only lasts a few hours. I don't think a whole life of comfort and a few hours of stress can be called suffering. I am against industrial farms with inhumane storing conditions, but there is nothing wrong with traditional outdoor farms.

**eating meat is murder**
Is killing animals really fundamentally bad? I mean, animals die anyway. And they don't do anything with their lives, so their dying sooner doesn't really change anything. If you kill a human, you kill him before he's done all the things he'll do in his life, but animals don't do anything in their life, so what difference does it make? Also, you have no problem with animals dying in the wilderness, and in the wilderness they probably die sooner than in captivity. 

[Edit] : I get a lot of replies about how killing animals IS murder. I'l therefore clarify my point of view : 
If killing humans was allowed, society would collapse. Everyone would just grab weapons and kill their neighbours. Therefore, killing humans is called murder and is forbidden. However, authorizing to kill animals does not harm society. There is no reason to forbid killing animals.

Maybe you think that there should be a fundamental law of ethics which states killing animals. I don't. If you do, then there is no point in us arguing, because neither of us is right, we have simply made different choices. The question I ask here is : if we don't consider ""not killing animals"" a moral law, is there any good reason to not kill animals?","2016-07-10 20:07:42","0","100","0.41","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/4s74hi/i_understand_why_we_need_to_reduce_our_meat/","True","akka-vodol","1747868171.417755","our planet is dying","manual"
