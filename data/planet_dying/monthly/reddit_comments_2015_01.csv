"cne28dm","t3_2r6on8","2r6on8","Conservative","unknown","> There are some discrepencies that need to be handled such as the Eric Garner case, I honestly thought the officer should have been indicted but we need the police.

You're thinking primarily emotionally and not legally or logically. The purpose of the grand jury was not to determine whether or not Officer Pantaleo did anything wrong. He clearly used a choke hold that was prohibited by NYPD policy. There is no doubt about that. The grand jury's job was to determine if there was probable cause to indict Pantaleo of the death of Eric Garner. So the question is: Did Pantaleo's use of an unauthorized choke hold directly lead to the cardiac arrest of Eric Garner? 

If you're being choked (i.e. obstruction of your trachea), it is impossible to speak. If your trachea is obstructed enough to prevent airflow to the lungs, it is also too obstructed to pass air over your vocal cords to speak, let alone say, ""I can't breathe"" seventeen times.

So what did cause the death of Garner? It was the combined weight of all the other officers on top of Garner who were trying to subdue him. All that weight did not let Garner's lungs expand adequately to allow for proper ventilation and oxygenation. If your lungs cannot expand fully, it is possible to speak and still not get enough oxygen. 

So while Garner's death is tragic, it was an accident, not from a banned choke hold, but from a commonly used procedure to subdue unruly suspects, namely the multiple-officer take down. In order to indict anyone of Garner's death, you would also have to show that they intended to harm/kill him when they tackled him or that his arrest was illegal in some way. 

Focusing on the choke hold and Pantaleo is a red herring. It's a highly-politicized, overly-emotional tool used by race baiters to stir up emotions and a sense of victimhood while ignoring objective realities and law. It's just another false narrative that pushes a political agenda at the expense of the truth, just like the ""Hands up, don't shoot"" lie. Don't fuel the fire by giving legitimacy to this distortion of reality that exacerbates racial tensions instead of alleviating them.

Saying Pantaleo should have been indicted because he used a choke hold on a man who died is like charging a man with intoxication manslaughter if he's driving drunk and hits a car who ran a red light. Sure, his driving while intoxicated, but it wasn't his intoxication that caused the collision. It would be appropriate to prosecute him for the DWI, but wholly inappropriate to charge him with intoxication manslaughter.

"cnp1e9w","t3_2sed61","2sed61","futurology","unknown","> Asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes and gamma ray bursts are only a sample of the mass extinction events nature could throw at us at any given time.

Asteroid impacts will not wipe out human kind, let along life on earth.  The likelihood of a extinction level asteroid impact diminishes as time goes on.  All extinction level asteroids in the solar system had been mapped and is not an issue.

Ditto with supervolcanoes - it will not wipe out human kind.

Gamma ray - the odds of life on earth being wipe out by gamma ray before the sun does the job is not worth considering.  It's far more likely the sun itself will go red giant before a gamma ray of sufficient strength point this way.

To sum up - there's no *natural* extinction risk for humans in the next million years.  That's more than enough time to develop the technology in a leisurely pace to colonize the galaxy.  We want to colonize space because that's a cool thing to do, and as George Mallory puts it ""because it's there"".  There's no need to make up stuff to add urgency to the matter.

>Life will die out much earlier than it needs to

What do you mean ""needs to""? Who needs? There's no such thing as Life, or Nature (mother nature?). It's just words we made up to give certain things names.

For thousands years humans were told (mostly by religion and social customs) that it is their duty to have offspring. 

But recently more and more people make conscious choice to not have children. Because we are not anyone's slaves and we do not owe anything to Life, or Nature or Order of Things.

Perhaps next level of ""growing up"" for our human civilization will be realization and acceptance that we do not really owe it to anyone to continue our line.

Whether in universe or even here on planet Earth.

What makes you think we will have dwindling Carbon in the atmospere?

Sequestering carbon could be an issue, because it was sequestered much faster back when there was no life that could break down lignin. But I think humans can decide when to start pulling Carbon out of the atmosphere, we just need market rules to apply enough motivation.

Earth will be fine in the long run, once we humans either die out or start behaving appropriately.

The rate that we are improving at is lightning and exponential. We will reach the stars in the next 1000 years. Fusion is coming along nicely.

"cnp69ji","t3_2sed61","2sed61","futurology","unknown","Barring any disasters, humanity will almost certainly develop mind uploading technology and become an immortal, software based entity capable of living in space and feeding on stars.

Such software based entities (which would also include AIs) would be perfect for living in space and could go on to build [Matrioshka brains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain) around stars. It will be software based entities that explore and colonise the universe.

Based on our own history of technological progress and knowledge of science, it seems reasonable to say that the technology for space travel and the technology for mind uploading will be developed within 200 years of year. I think that's a pretty conservative estimate and it's just a blip on evolutionary time scales. Given the advantage of being software based, it seems pretty obvious to me that space faring, intelligent life is going to be software based.

Unless we're the only intelligent life in the galaxy or are the most technologically advanced species, there should be stellar civilisations in our galaxy consisting of networks of Matrioshka brains and smaller, more mobile avatars used for exploration or whatever. Also, if the universe is full of life, then the oldest galaxies should have the most advanced software based civilisations.

Too much salinity, such as was found at the height of the Ice Ages where fresh water was greatly confined in land and sea ice, is very inimical to marine life. Over time, the oceans' salinity is increasing and might well cut back livability on the earth because it's where 90% of the oxygen we breath come from marine living blue green algae.

Given current rates of NaCl pollution of our coasts, there is going to be a serious problem within a few generations, and we cannot afford to ship that many gigatons of table salt off the earth, either.
