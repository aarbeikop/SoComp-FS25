"d0pn1x4","t3_493kzt","493kzt","conspiracy","unknown","""Oh hey if I make up a bunch of conjectured claims and link them all together, they must be true right!?"". 

There is no evidence that remotely supports Stonehenge being 500,000+ years old what so ever, indeed Cro-Magnon Man did not begin to settle Europe until ~40,000 years ago. 

Erosion patterns on the sphinx and surrounded pit suggest the presence of water erosion. This would place it back in the Old Dynasty era, around 5,000 years ago (current theory suggests it was built ~4,000). 

> if you looked into these topics deeply, with an open mind; you would begin to see a pattern

This phrase seems to pop up a lot on this thread. It translates most effectively into ""If you utterly disregard any evidence that you don't particularly like or understand then obviously it was Aliens/The Illuminati/Rothschild/Zionists!!!!"".

> The purpose is to keep you small, to make you small

Yes of course because if humanity knew that it had been around in 150,000BC building stone artefacts that would... uh... yeah that would be total social revolution baby, the new world order would crumble away under that knowledge!

> the ""Priest Class""

The stratification of society during the formation of larger settlements and development of more advanced agricultural techniques is not a secret. In fact it's pretty standard anthropology. You also have the rise of a warrior class to enforce the priestly demands and thus the birth of class conflict around the same era. But of course you already know this right?

> These men made discoveries about nature, reality, physics, geometry, time, philosophy, and spirituality that today would blow our minds

So mindblowing that nothing they built lasted? That not one trace of their glorious civilization remains? Sorry, this just isn't how human development works. We want from building small towns and cities in the Hilly Flanks circa 13,000BCE all for it to disappears in 12,500 with the Younger Dryas, yet within 3,000 years we see formalized cities with God-Kings, well established social narratives, and extensive agriculture. Why was your older civilization not able to re-establish? 

> Something happened. We'll call it X.

Don't think I'll even bother with this. If you need to introduce concepts like Satan to back up what is already just a string of utterly unsupported statements then you clearly don't know what you're talking about. What about climatic change? What about disease? But no, you need to satisfy you're pseudo-intellectual-spiritual mumbo-jumbo so we're left with 'evil' being the only possible cause that your fantasy civilization had to collapse.

"d0ormsl","t3_493kzt","493kzt","conspiracy","unknown","While I find the theory attractive, and I'm not averse to the sentiments expressed, further I agree that we are slaves to the system and that there is a better system, and it's up to us to find it, declare it and implement it, I find the specific details which underlie your theory to be somewhat vague, kind of fluffy and hard to pin down, and I suspect unsubstantiated or substantiated only by youtube videos or ""documentaries"". 

I'll give you an example of what I mean; I watched the documentary series ""The Pyramid Code"" which discussed theories that sound very similar to what you describe. One of it's core theories is that the pyramids were in effect, gigantic batteries or power generators of some sort, which somehow used the structures of the underlying rock along with water from the Nile to concentrate electricity into the pyramids. To my mind, if this is true, it should be relatively simple to reproduce a working model of the pyramid power generators on a smaller scale, and measure the electrical charge of the structure. No one has actually done this, to my understanding, which makes me suspect that it's not actually possible.

You say: 

>Such has been the case with literally tens of thousands of discoveries throughout just the last few centuries.

I have certainly heard hundreds of similar claims, and studied many of them with care. Every single one of these claims was fraudulent. Give us just one example; make it your best, so that can examine it.

I'm confident that your intentions are good and your heart is pure, but I suspect that you've been taken in by some new-agey feel good cultish sciency babble myths that abound on the internet. My fear is this: we must live our lives by what we know and believe to be true; we must do what is right. If we do the right things, but we do them for the wrong reasons, we are setting ourselves up for failure; because doing the right things worked, we now believe our reasons are right; we become righteous. When we become righteous we are willing to cause suffering to others in the belief that our reasons and our actions are unassailable; thus our righteousness leads us down a path that can very easily become twisted and evil.

You are asking us to examine our assumptions; this is good and right. Be wary of assuming your own assumptions are unassailable; you may be standing on quicksand and assuming it's as solid as a pyramid.","2016-03-05 19:08:00","10","humanefly","1747861318.66506","our planet is dying","manual"

"d0p8k7z","t3_493kzt","493kzt","conspiracy","unknown","I agree with everything you said. Thanks for the summary.  I want to add that when you look at the things that the ""priest caste"" finds the very most repugnant and makes the most taboo is what is the biggest threat to them, and which is probably the ""way out"" of their oppression.  

It's the psychedelics. 

* DMT
* Mushrooms (similar molecule to dmt)

The gnostic superclass gets to hide out in the shadows using these as a tool, while preventing outgroups from having access to them.  Freemasons love to come and attack this idea because they are low level.  High levels just won't talk about it, or won't give the idea any audience.  

This is a perfect Janus face of the Roman empire that persists to this day (it never died).  We know this becauase Terence McKenna spilled the beans.  So did the Rosicrucians; so did the alchemists.  It's written all over if you learn to read the signs:

* Acacia leaf in freemasonry -- acacia contains DMT
* Mushrooms encoded in freemasonic symbols and catholic symbols, motifs
* Amanita and psilocybe mushrooms are steganographically encoded into many many works of christian art
* Orobouros the snake eating the tail and gaining crown and wings -- this is the 'snake' of christiantiy.  Sorry for the spoiler.  It's Quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent.  It's a program that plays out when you take mushrooms.  You are swallowed by a cosmic serpent, spiral around until you get to the center of it all.  And there you find great wisdom, possibly taking flight with the dragon.  Spoiler!
* Freemason Checkerboard is a closed eye visuals effect everyone experiences with onset of mushroom trip.  Stunning Geometries are also what happens as it intensifies.  That's another reason they worship 'sacred geometry', not just to make mandalas for hanging in windows.
* Santa claus and reindeers and all the christmas motifs are hidden information about the amanita muscaria that grows under conifers which were collected and hung in the trees to dry (ornaments for the tree), because only when the mushroom is dry can it be consumed safely for the 'trip'.  Reindeers because they preferentially eat amanita muscaria.  Red and white of santa are amanita colors.
*  Holy grail was a wooden cup with 'lamb of god' ie: innoculated with mycelium of amanita muscaria, just add water and it perpetually creates more 'white wool' within the cup, ""ambrosia"", as psychoactive as the mushroom.  This lamb is created from dried bits of mushroom, suggesting the mushroom ressurrects itself.
* UFOs are a very common motif associated with psychedelics, interacting with alien entities.  Some people come back with some very interesting insight.  What if someone doesn't want you (government / crown / pope) to come back with any special, potentially world-changing insights (Nikola Tesla).

---

You know psychedlics are taboo for several reasons.  1) the cabal is running both sides of the war on drugs, namely peddling opiods as it's the biggest revenue earner, and science proves that psychedelics shatter addiction to all drugs.  LSD and ketamine break alcohol addiction; Ketamine and ibogaine break opiod addiction.  Very likely psilocybin can work in some capacity on both addictions, but it also breaks addiction to unhappiness (depression).  They want to keep selling their bad drugs to you.  They don't want you to get your hands on the antidote. 

2) This knowledge that OP talks about is accessible through contemplation of ecclectic gnostic wisdom, meditation, but the real awakening happens through altered states of consciousness. That's where the real magick happens.  Which, in metaphysical terms, is using the mind to open doorways, to take new subway routes of your reality; in scientific terms, to access a quantum indeterminacy of reality and using attention, intention and will (magick) choose the reality you want versus the one that will happen by default.  This is one thing they know and do not want you to know.  That magick is actually real and it doesn't work in the way you think (copperfield).

Yes you *can* pull a red blanket from the aether, but no one will ever know..because although the universe autocorrects itself on your behalf, from other's perspective the red blanket was always there. This is not solipsism, this is reality as a mutable but ad-hoc consensus with the possibility of quantum derangement of self-limited scope.

That's why you can't prove magic is real: you're the only one who made it through that hoop into a reality in which it always happened.... from a reality in which it didn't and never would.

This kind of thing got people burned at the stake.  Scoff!  Thinking magick is real.  They never will allow common man the technology of magic.  They can only have officially sanctioned technology fire and earth, of the material realm.  Not the one of wind and water.","2016-03-06 03:43:55","8","[deleted]","1747861318.6737149","our planet is dying","manual"

This part is just straight retarded.

Source?

Again, what is the evidence behind these claims?

>Gold mines in Africa have been discovered in over a dozen countries that simply must have been dug tens of thousands of years ago, yet they are cut through the Earth with such precision; our modern technology and all its glory could not re-create the efficiency.

There's a saying, ""Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence"" I've seen many such documentaries claiming similar things, but I have not seen much proof that hasn't been debunked before.
