"ctwsr04","t3_3gcbo4","3gcbo4","AskReddit","unknown","I'd ask.

I honestly believe that even if the earth was dying - like, even if it was absolutely guaranteed to be unsuitable for living on in the near future - you'd still get a good portion of people who wouldn't want to go.  For example, some elderly people.  It'd be a long journey for them to take in what may be extremely uncomfortable conditions to get somewhere completely new.  Not all of them, of course, but a good portion of them might prefer to stay in relative comfort where they spent their entire lives.  Some people taking care of religious sites may prefer to stay and take care of them with the hopes of a good spot in the afterlife - or just very religious people in general who might consider the end of the planet to be their god's plan and leaving would be interfering, etc.  People who are afraid of space travel.  People who loved the earth as their home for the past X years and are happy to fade out with it.  People who think it's a government conspiracy.  You know there'd be some of those...

I think you'd definitely at least get close to 50% not wanting to go.","2015-08-09 11:56:04","2","samwisery","1747848003.0063648","our planet is dying","manual"

"ctxpz3w","t3_3f7v00","3f7v00","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I actually fear immortality. you would not be moping floors for a thousand years, you will be doing it FOR EVER, nothing changes, everything is the same, there is no a real tomorrow because it would be the same ""floor moping"" than yesterday and today, you would become less than a machine, you, the mop and the floor, alone, for billions, trillions, and even more numbers that you can not even remember, does not matter if there are others immortals, everyone knows every single one, because... is immortality, you already meet everyone, time is an illusion at that point, is you, the mop, the floor and tons of others walking around moping, not talking, nothing new could be born because is... eternity... a new baby is born, he is also immortal, he will learn from others, do as other, take his mop, and start cleaning, and meet people, new people, everyday, but is immortal, so he will soon also meet everyone as well, and go to mop the floor as well.

....

so this time you are the only immortal, the world ends, explode, destroyed, broken pieces in space, no air so is painful at the start, but you will get use to it... because why not? you have all the time of it, to move to another planet, have live o not, or end pulled by a sun, burning and burning, you can not die, just burn away wishing for the sun to collapse already into a black hole, then... you enter the black hole... what happens then? time dilute, lights bends, everything goes dark, but you are still alive, because you are immortal, total darkness, infinity emptiness, just you, your thoughts... after a long time you will just stop thinking, because, there is no point to it, you could slumber into a dream that will slowly fade away into darkness, you know? lets make it to be a eternal dream, everyday more vivid than before, only to become your reality, a dream, your mind becomes the true reality you are in, the real only thing that is you, but even after all that, there is also possible to just stop your dreams, wake up, and never sleep, there is no need, painful things become the only form you can actually tell you are alive, because there is nothing else, only darkness remain, you are still there, alive... yet empty, alone in complete darkness... so go back to sleep and become again a god of a infinity dream that you create... is that really what you want?

....

this time everyone is immortal, but the planet is destroyed, you find a way to stay with someone even if you could not escape the blast, lets say you hold hands? nah the force is too strong and you end separate, but you are going to a new place with another person beside you, or more, just drifting slowly in space, using sight language because no air to speak, and even if you could, could you hear it? so you, and other going in the same direction? or are they? is infinity your destiny, even if they get away 1 millimeter per ""day"", you will end alone, you can not change your trajectory, just drift straight or in a circle, you maybe will meet someone else in the giant space, lets say you do, because is infinity, it is possible, still in space? or in another planet, with no life? or one with advance technology beyond what the earth was ever, or one that is a ball of ice, or one with life so big that you are even less than an ant to then, or one so little that could be destroyed with your hand, you could even become their god, another human comes from space, a second god? would you accept it? and yet, another planet that ends, again in space, again floating waiting for the next planet, now the planet with high technology, you fly around in space, meet others, you can even decide to go and take every other ""human"" in space, you have the time for it, that's for sure, everyone is happy, but... again, here comes again the slow meekness of everyone an immortal, then they decide to destroy the ship and never make another one, they leave in pairs? or alone? in groups? who knows, as they want, even if they are different, they will end taking the same choice, immortality, exp makes a person, so as a immortal everyone one way or another will get the same exp, so they are just copies of themselves, so the choice of one becomes the choices of everyone. Save everyone to break apart in the end, that's gonna happen, because is eternity after all, the most fun moments would be when you were treat like a god. To make a simulation world like matrix? sure, go on, but, still, can all that be still called living? 

....

as well, you and everyone just awaits is eternal boredom, alone or together, who knows, as an immortal you are not longer bound by NOTHING, not even planets or suns can bend you for eternity, the only thing that can stop and ""control"" you is nothingness itself, as a immortal you are no longer a human, fears are not existent any more, you don't fear nothing, be a god or the end of the universe itself, killing or not killing is not even a question, is just you playing around with meat, the meat can evolve and ""seal you"" away in a place, a rock, a cave, or trow you into space, but that's is just another event not important to happen, because you can just wait for the next time, because you are immortal, all the time while you understand that you can end in nothingness, again? boredom? that would be your fear?.","2015-08-10 06:40:01","1","[deleted]","1747848420.615606","our planet is dying","manual"
