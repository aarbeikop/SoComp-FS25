Well I've had a few thoughts and just wondered if they sounded plausible. Also I'm from the UK so things may sound different depending where you're from.

Firstly, there would obviously be an increased need for bus routes for rural commutes and likely more trains. For example I live in a very small village that has a bus, usually for the elderly, once a week so I need a car for work and social reasons. But I personally don't like driving which brings me to my second point:

Increased tax and costs to own a car. This is to hopefully persuade people to use the increased public transport and the money from rich people and die-hard motor-heads (through vehicle tax, road tax and insurance and fuel reserved exclusively for vehicles) would possibly fund this, as well as renewable energy which brings me to my final point:

(Side note: I wouldn't expect emergency services such as ambulances or fire trucks or people who use a vehicle for work such as builders or delivery people to foot this increased bill as much or at all in cases like ambulances)

Increased production of electric vehicles. This means my public transport plan would only be in effect while electric vehicles were massed produced. This means people who work in car factories wouldn't lose their jobs or mechanics.

Now this would require tonnes of planning and money but who thinks this could work? I'd be interested to know!","2018-01-30 20:27:44","1","1","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/7u40wm/buses_instead_of_cars/","True","Waldy565","1747898943.165204","our planet is dying","manual"
