"erj8si4","t3_c2bfyv","c2bfyv","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","This is dangerously close to a Rule #9 violation, but I agree with /u/UT_Teapot that it's important to discuss the anxiety.

I've been where you are, many times. The crippling fear. The existential dread. The thoughts of pointlessness in the face of the immensity of climate change.

I've come up with a few mantras that help me deal with it, some basic tenets that are solid, true, and proven through history. These help me:

1. Change always happens at the margins. Things that were impossible a century ago are commonplace now, but when they started they were 1% or less of the population.
2. Change never happens as fast as you like. It can take years for a critical mass to build up to meaningful change. See: womens suffrage, civil rights, anti-smoking laws, leaded gasoline removal, gay rights in USA, the Montreal Protocol. All took a long time to implement, but now they are mainstream.
3. Our species is not suicidal. Cultures have failed, nations and empires risen and fallen, whole continents turned barren (See: North Africa during ancient Rome) and yet we have persisted. Our species is a species of survivors, and even though we have had the capability to kill our whole selves off for the last 50+ years (WMDs) we haven't done it. We are generally NOT suicidal as species.
4. Society is flexible. It changes all the time, sometimes we don't even notice but it's always changing and adapting. It can conform to fit any mold. We've had floods, droughts, supervolcanos (Krakatoa), famines, plagues, wars, invasions, and all manner of awfulness befall our ancestors, and yet society has continued in the face of adversity. It changes to fit the circumstance, always. We are all changing, right now.
5. We made this problem. We can fix this problem. Simple fact - this global warming issue was caused by our behavior and our technology, it can be FIXED with our behavior and our technology. It will not be easy, it will not be quick, we will have to SCIENCE THE SHIT OUT OF IT, but we CAN do. We made the issue - we can damn well UNMAKE the issue too!

Never give up. The future is not set, and nothing that anyone says can predict the true course we will follow. Ignore the doomsayers and focus on action as best you can in your life and use your voice to encourage others to do the same. Get involved in a climate related cause that means something to you! Don't just sit by and let the years pass in further anxiety. Action is the best antidote, and even one person can change the whole world.","2019-06-19 04:43:58","248","WaywardPatriot","1747929690.923593","our planet is dying","manual"
"erj2bhv","t3_c2bfyv","c2bfyv","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","I come to this subreddit and read up on the news. I also know that I don't now how my future is going to play out. I went through a few instances of existential crises until I realized that when you're dead, you no longer care about anything. You only freak out at how painful death might be. We don't know how any of us are going to die. Could be a car crash, could be a brain aneurysm. For me I'm fucking scared of getting ALS as at least in a situation where the world would be like that of Mad Max Fury Road (which is impossible even if we burn all of our fossil fuel sources) at least there's a fighting chance to survive. They even had hydroponics in the film. 

I know that we have the technology to ensure we can adapt and survive. We can build farms inside shipping containers, we can get fresh water from the sea/air/etc. We can get energy from the atom, the sun, and the wind. We can edit genetics of lifeforms to ensure they can survive in a world affected by man made climate change. Because we can do all of this, and currently are, is what gives me hope for the future and calms my anxiety even when I read the most blatant doomsday alarmism submissions on /r/worldnews. 

I normally don't allow discussions on here, but I'll allow this one so people can discuss how they deal with it.","2019-06-19 03:07:34","47","[deleted]","1747929690.9269161","our planet is dying","manual"
"erjf0x5","t3_c2bfyv","c2bfyv","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","I know [I'm not the only one](https://np.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/comments/bd2yl2/citizens_climate_lobby_has_added_over_50000_new/em147gm/?context=3) to find relief in actively working to solve the problem. And I'm not just talking about recycling or whatever, but [the kind of systemic change that's needed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/). Here are some examples of some things I've done:

* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  

* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). 

* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.

* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. 

* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). 

* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. 

* I gave two [presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/159) to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee & Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for. I [arranged these presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/160) myself. 

* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously ""Safe Passage""](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)

* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee & Dividend and try to get their support. 

It may be that at least some of these things are having an impact. [Just five years ago, only 30% of Americans supported a carbon tax](http://closup.umich.edu/issues-in-energy-and-environmental-policy/13/public-views-on-a-carbon-tax-depend-on-the-proposed-use-of-revenue/). Today, [it's over half](https://news.gallup.com/poll/232007/americans-want-government-more-environment.aspx). If you think Congress doesn't care about public support, have a look at [what the evidence shows](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651). 

[Lobbing works](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/june-2017-meeting-analysis-1127.pdf), and [you don't need a lot of money to be effective](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). 

So if you want to ease your anxiety by actively working on solving the problem, here's what I'd recommend:

1. [Sign up for Citizens' Climate Lobby and CCLCommunity](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax). Be sure you edit your Community Profile to reflect your interests in CCL so you can be connected with relevant opportunities. 

2. [Sign up for the Intro Call for new volunteers](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-weekly-intro-call/) 

3. [Take the Climate Advocate Training](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/new-member/#climateadvocatetraining)

4. [Get in touch with your local chapter leader](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/chapters/) (there are [chapters all over the world](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/chapters/)) and find out how you can best leverage your time, skills, and connections to [create the political world for a livable climate](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/levers-of-political-will/).

5. Start [training](https://community.citizensclimate.org/topics) in whichever topics most interest you and that are most needed in your area. The training is available on CCL Community, on YouTube, or in podcast form, so choose whichever best fits with your lifestyle.

6. Invite your friends, family, and neighbors to join you. Irl might be best, but CCL is also on Instagram, Twitter, and Youtube, and it's especially easy to invite your friends to follow CCL on Facebook.","2019-06-19 06:41:16","45","ILikeNeurons","1747929690.934259","our planet is dying","manual"

"erj9ydl","t3_c2bfyv","c2bfyv","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","Please hang in there, friend! After about two months of persistent and suffocating “existential dread” like you describe, I have finally found some relief and productive outlets. I hope some of these things can help you: (1) This sub and reading encouragement from users like u/UT_teapot have helped me a lot. The same way pessimism often boils over in some posts on other subs (like r/worldnews), the positivity and common cause here carries its own type of momentum. (2) Thanks to insightful posts by u/ILikeNeurons, I have gotten involved with my local chapter of the [Citizens’ Climate Lobby](citizensclimatelobby.org) . Please look into it if you haven’t already! (3) I also found this document, [Coping with Climate Change Distress](https://www.psychology.org.au/getmedia/cf076d33-4470-415d-8acc-75f375adf2f3/coping_with_climate_change.pdf.pdf), (put together by some climate change and mental health-oriented groups in Australia) to be helpful in terms of finding effective strategies. (4) I have never been into this type of thing in the past, but I discovered mindfulness meditation a few weeks ago. The central idea, as I understand it, is that we often conceive of our “self” as our train of thought. This type of meditation has helped me to remember that I am not the stress. The stress is very real and reasonable, but it is not me. That has transformed my thinking lately and opened up some mental real estate for more productive things than dread. It has also helped me avoid the runaway thoughts about the future that I’m sure you’re familiar with. (5) Occasionally you will see users on Reddit or Twitter that post something that makes you feel hopeful or reminds you that there are many of us trying our best to “right the ship.” I recommend direct messaging those people to let them know that they have encouraged you. It’s a small thing that lifts both people up a little. (Taking my own advice, I hope u/UT_Teapot and u/ILikeNeurons see this and know that they have made a hugely positive impact on me.)","2019-06-19 05:03:51","21","thebearsaint","1747929690.9393501","our planet is dying","manual"

Another thing I like to do is look at futurism stuff, like about how we will colonize the solar system (Isaac Arthur's stuff on youtube is really interesting).

"erjnv3q","t3_c2bfyv","c2bfyv","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","Honestly, this probably isn't the answer you'd expect to find in this sub, but I've dealt with my own climate anxiety (and other anxieties in my life) in a pretty unorthodox way: by largely subscribing to the philosophical concept of [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism). Basically, it says that there is ultimately no objective or inherent value in anything, but that we should remain defiant of that absurd reality and continue ascribing value to ourselves, each other and other things we hold dear.

It's incredibly easy to get overwhelmed by the converging crises of climate change, unfettered capitalism, and society's uncanny ability to self-sabotage, but the reason we get overwhelmed is because of the scale of these issues and the relatively tiny impact each person has to change them.

The way I try to approach it is this: focus on the microcosms. Volunteer at your favorite non profit, adopt a puppy from a shelter, go camping with a group of good friends. Focus on the small spheres where you can certainly have a positive impact, and create positive experiences and memories for yourself and others. Because you may not be able to make a massive shift in the direction of the world on your own, but you can make a powerful impact on an individual life (""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire""). If everyone did that, then the collective positive actions will send ripples across the world in ways you can't even anticipate.

Dan Harmon has a really good take on this and I often rewatch this clip when I'm feeling down: [""The knowledge that nothing matters, while accurate, gets you nowhere...but when you zoom in on Earth, when you zoom in on a family, or a childhood or an experience, you see all these things that matter.""](https://youtu.be/de2grEPn7rg?t=112) 

Maybe this isn't the most appropriate answer for this sub since it doesn't have to do much with climate-related action, but it's the way I'm able to get myself out of bed in the morning and keep things in perspective when I'm feeling overwhelmed by these issues.","2019-06-19 10:20:24","14","[deleted]","1747929690.943382","our planet is dying","manual"

We're continuing research work, but many of the graver issues identified haven't even had the causes identified, nevermind any solutions. Still, we continue our work in the hope there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. It helps to get away from work regularly to distract ourselves. 

I guess that's why most everyone here is vegan though. It helps to give yourself the impression that personal agency is meaningful in the face of the sheer size of the problem.

One thing that really helps (me) is understanding that the only difference between us and the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs is that we can think about morality. In evolution’s eyes, in the planet’s eyes, we are just another mass extinction. They don’t care that our means were silos and drills rather than volcanoes. We are but another notch in the planet’s wall, life will persist and will almost definitely be beautiful and diverse again, one day.

Apart from that, I’m still a moral being, and so still feel the guilt of what we are doing and a drive to try and change it.

"erk8c6e","t3_c2bfyv","c2bfyv","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","The thing about the climate crisis is *it's unprecedented*. 

That means even the biggest brains on the planet can only guess at how it plays out, what negative and positive feedback loops will be triggered, etc.

Keeping that in mind, I focus on two things:

**1. ""Horton Hears a Who""** In this Dr. Seuss story, a tiny world is contained on a speck of dust. In the climax (spoiler), all the people are screaming ""We're here! We're here! We're here!"" at the top of their lungs, but it's just not getting thru. *Until*. One last kid decides to help and just says ""Yop!"" and that is the final bit needed to break thru and save them.

I imagine each of us and each greenhouse gas reducing action we take, might be that final ""Yop!"" that saves us. That buys us *just* enough time for scientists to figure it out. So every little thing I do helps. And even if I can't get my family, friends, neighbors, government, corporations to do *everything* I want, each single thing I *can* get them to do might be the ""Yop!""

Unprecendented. We have no *precise* idea where the point-of-no-return tipping point is. So any ""Yop!"" might be the one we need.

**2. The Singularity.** If you haven't heard about it, read up on it a bit. Basically, our knowledge base and ability to process knowledge into useable ideas is growing *exponentially*. Which means technology is growing exponentially. And scientific understanding is growing exponentially.

So exponentially, that at some point, computers will solve problems *by themselves* exponentially faster than all the human brains on the planet ever could. It's astonishing (and a bit terrifying).

Combining the Singularity with ""Horton Hears a Who,"" to me the issue becomes buying science enough time to figure the thing out. We may never return to what we had pre-icecaps-melting, but it might not be as big an extinction and we likely would be able to restore a lot of the species lost over time.

In that more optimistic scenario, we all hustle our butts and do what we can, and the next age of human civilization is one where humans undo and restore. Finally acknowledging the incredible, miraculous interconnected web in each ecosystem, removing invasive species, removing pollutants, restoring natives in the original combinations, and one-piece-at-a-time repairing what we undid. Wow. How cool would that be? It might take a thousand years, but it could be done if it were profitable and government funded (not to mention culturally ""in"").

TL/DR I focus on the fact that no one *knows* for sure what will happen when and instead focus on doing everything I can to buy science and technology just enough time to figure out that last minute save.

""Apollo 13"" is a great metaphor for what I see:

1. Race to save the astronauts, but they have to cut back power usage to help the effort: [""We gotta turn everything off!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tid44iy6Rjs&feature=youtu.be&t=28)

2. That buys the scientists enough time to work on a solution. [""I suggest you gentlemen invent a way to put a square peg in a round hole.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry55--J4_VQ)

2. I'm doing what I reasonably can to reduce my footprint: I tend to walk wherever I'm going, I reuse dishes when possible, I've changed all my lights to LED's and am planning to replace my washing machine, water heater, fridge and stove with more energy-efficient versions.

**Dear Everyone Else offering advice in this thread,**

There looks to be some real solid advice here. (Special shout out to [/u/ILikeNeurons](https://www.reddit.com/user/ILikeNeurons/) and [/u/thebearsaint](https://www.reddit.com/user/thebearsaint/).) I bookmarked this page, which I do not do with Reddit. I will be coming back here for reference as long as it stays up.

As for myself, I need to ""do what I can"" and then find a way to ""let the rest go."" I am not, and have never really been the activist type, due in part to my anxiety issues. I'm also looking for less, not more things on my ""to do"" list, so I don't know how effective I will be with some of the activism advice, but I will take an honest look and try to do as much as I can.

Recycling (really downcycling) at best only saves half the energy of producing new plastic.  China no longer accepts our plastic so a lot of ""recycled plastic"" is ending up in landfills. Better to just eliminate plastic use - check out r/ZeroWaste 

>How can I change my diet to better impact the environment?

Learn to garden. If you have a yard use it for food production.  For food you don't produce yourself, try to purchase from farmers who practice regenerative agriculture.  Figure out how to meet nutritional requirements without meat.

>What can I do in my everyday life to cut down on my pollution?

Live Simply.  Besides changing food habits, don't buy much, and when you do buy, buy second-hand or an object that will last a lifetime. Avoid traveling long distances. Hang your laundry to dry. Live in a small space that does not require much energy to heat. 

>What companies should we stay away from?

All of them.  Whenever possible, make what you need or buy second-hand.  Prefer local enterprises for services and goods you don't have the skills or means to meet yourself. 

>How can we get the attention of people who don't care or refuse to listen about climate change?

It is not easy.  But the biggest problem is not lack of awareness, it is people who are aware but do not act on their awareness, or if they do act they do not go beyond token gestures.

>How can we prepare for the changing environment without feeling like we are just going to die?

It is better to learn to accept death as a part of life and to be thankful for the time that we have. It is not easy to fully confront your own mortality but it is ultimately liberating.  Once you have accepted the inevitability of death and of all things outside of your control, you can focus your energy on what you can control.","2019-06-20 07:07:19","8","1HomoSapien","1747929698.462647","our planet is dying","manual"

- Walk, take public transport when possible 
- check your local waste management website to see what types of plastics and garbage go in which bin 
- unfortunately straws are made of crappy plastic that cannot be recycled so avoid buying/using at all restaurants! You can buy reusable straws or paper straws if needed
- use reusable produce bags at the grocery store
- use cotton tote bags (no plastic)
- bamboo toothbrush
- buy local fruits and veg that are in season
- avoid buying things in lots of plastic packaging (ex if you  are buying yogurt, get the big tub rather than a bunch of individual sizes) 
- try to clean up a place in your community; this doesn't take long and you may be able to get garbage bags donated... This also raises public awareness
- shampoo bar (lush has excellent ones) 
- make your own coffee at home/ no paper cups
- washable cloth napkins instead of tissues and paper napkins
- don't buy synthetic clothing (polyester, acrylic, etc); when washed; thousands of plastic fibers are released which are difficult to filter in waste water treatment plant
- styrofoam takes the longest to decay so try to avoid this the most!!!! 
- research big companies like Nestle that are making quite a splash in the news regarding groundwater 
- avoid fast fashion (synthetic materials)
- use looseleaf tea (most of the bags have plastic in them)

This is a good and doable start to living consciously! You do not have to make big changes all at once, but gradually..for example when it's time to get a new toothbrush or shampoo consider making a change.there is a lot of information online about zero waste/ conscientious shopping/etc.","2019-06-20 04:00:51","4","here4wine","1747929698.468527","our planet is dying","manual"

Why Wall-E feels the need to scavenge useful items and self repair.

Why Eve shoots at anything that moves and why Otto REALLY doesn't want to go back.

Because survivors used plants grown in their underground vaults to lure them back there and ambush them. Early on they still have a few crude spaceships in orbit. They're no match for the escapee's tech though.

The left behind people built the wind turbines we see and used Wall-E blocks to build fortifications.

Fact:

1. Violence world wide has been decreasing over time.    The last two decades have been the most peaceful on record.  Even in the US violent crime is dropping.  Things seem to be getting better.
2. Wealth has never increased this much world-wide.  Literally billions have been lifted out of poverty.  Doesn't mean they are all living at Western Nation standards but the vast majority of humanity isn't destitute anymore.
3. Many people have predicted massive climate change and that we'd all be dead by year X which simply hasn't happened yet.  Yes, I think global warming is a thing and bad stuff could happen in the near future - for instance, ecological refugees is eventually going to be a thing as sea levels rise, coastal cities will be flooded and places like Bangladesh will likely be permanently flooded.  But it doesn't mean an end of the world.  For instance, the extra CO2 in the atmosphere is greening the planet.    Earth will reach a new equilibrium at some point.   Best thing to do is keep an eye out.
4. You seem to think that the globe isn't moving on this.   I think on the contrary that various people are taking actions.  The whole mass migrations happening with people moving into Europe is probably part of this.  The big question is - can we do anything about it tangibly?

Lets face it -- there's too many people on earth.   Population on earth would have to drop to early industrial levels to reverse the trend.  Back in 1900, world population was 1.5 billion (est).  Today we are around 7.5 billion people.  5 times as much.    Now you, if you were the leader of the world - lets say we had a global government.  Would you really be willing to cull 75% to 80% of the population so that we could save the species?

Does anybody on the planet have that authority?  Would we want to have anybody be able to get rid of so many people?  Would you be willing to kill yourself to save civilization?  That's the conundrum of our times.

Like it or not, there's nobody here living that either has the authority or the willingness to ""fix"" the problem because the solution is so drastic and final.  So we either ride it out, adapt, or try to smooth things out.

Earth will take care of the problem by itself.   Just consider yourself lucky if you happen to live in a western nation in the northern hemisphere.  The further north, the better.","2019-06-07 16:51:40","4","Dingbat1967","1747930476.598943","our planet is dying","manual"

Look, nothing happens overnight. There isn’t a magic “fix the world” button that some CEO could press. Even if the powerful made a concerted effort, it would take years if not decades to “fix the world.” 

It requires 90% of the people to do good. The other 10% will follow because they will be forced to (money, politics, new laws, etc). That means it’s on YOU. And me. And everyone else in this thread. So start small and build habits. Your habits will reverberate and push others to do the same. The good you start today will set an example for the good done tomorrow (read: a decade from now).

So here’s a few good spins on bleak situations for some positivity. There’s always a bright side.

-more people are attending higher education than ever before

-we are producing more than ever despite wages stagnating, which means people have more material wealth

-US (example) emissions have been decreasing since 2005
