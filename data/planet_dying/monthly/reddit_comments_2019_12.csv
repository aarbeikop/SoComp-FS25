But seriously, if you want to get out of your current state, stop smoking weed. Figure out why you're in debt and make a plan for how to avoid that in the future. The world isn't going to end in your lifetime. The country probably won't either. The middle ground you don't think exists anymore *did* exist as recently as 5 years ago, and probably will return once the moral panic we're in dies down (they always do).","2019-12-12 16:18:03","10","[deleted]","1747940854.3662431","our planet is dying","manual"

2. The way you use your words in combination with the words you use is amazing. I envy that so much. You should be a writer.
3. You make some amazing points and I've been becoming fed up with this overly online life(lol at saying that on reddit)
4. Fantasizing about the life you should be living like that is a big mood.","2019-12-12 20:00:51","5","itsmeaginik","1747940854.367321","our planet is dying","manual"

A lot of times I get depressed as I see no real future. The only thing I look forward to are my dreams and stories. None of which anyone else is interested in seeing.","2019-12-12 19:00:41","3","cglr224","1747940854.368366","our planet is dying","manual"

It is called Kal Yuga (the age of downfall) in Ancient Hindu scriptures. Self mastery is the key to the problems around us according to anti-dot theories of Kal Yuga. I am not good at it but I am practicing.

"falrb2y","t3_e9pcxe","e9pcxe","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","With all due respect, everyone at times dreams of becoming a celebrity, but it sounds like you only define ""success"" as reaching celebrity status.  That will just lead you further into depression, because most of us will never be world-famous.  And that's just fine.  In our fame-obsessed world we forget that there's real dignity and happiness in earning an honest living and making small changes in your community.  99.9% of the world's population for thousands of years has lived and died without being validated by global fame.

Come on, man.  Who cares what politicians and executives are doing half a world away when you can't even get out of bed.  It's not a politician's fault you can't make that sandwich.  I know, that's harsh.  But seriously, you're depressed because you have no control over your daily life.  Find out where that debt came from.  Take control of the daily aspects of your life.

And yes, I agree with Jordan Peterson that you should clean your room.  Your apartment is likely filthy and depressing, that's why you're depressed.  You've abdicated responsibility for your own life because people have taught you that it's cool to be depressed about global problems you have no control over.  Start exerting control over problems you can fix, and focus on you.","2019-12-12 22:19:00","1","GaiusPompeius","1747940854.373745","our planet is dying","manual"
"fandnz0","t3_e9pcxe","e9pcxe","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","As someone who has been in a similar situation growing up i can understand. 

I grew up in the projects moved around quite a bit from one government housing to the next however, that taught me that i need to focus on a goal and work harder than most.

I started at minimum wage at 18 and now i make enough were im living comfortably because my mindset was find a job i enjoyed and accel at it. 

Some people work to survive, but If you find a job you enjoy it makes your life 100x better.","2019-12-13 11:22:58","1","Generalchance107","1747940854.37569","our planet is dying","manual"

Science still doesn't know what consciousness is. This whole thing could just be a simulation, how could you know? There's an element of faith in the ultimate meaning of life which I think is important for people to have, and maybe you need to develop that.","2019-12-29 07:07:52","2","[deleted]","1747940876.4911191","our planet is dying","manual"

Perhaps we were never meant to hit this point in evolution, or maybe it was supposed to happen, depending on your beliefs. But really friend stop thinking about it. Live your life, when it happens, it happens, and everything fades out of existence. It has a rather stoic beauty really. But just live life and have fun and enjoy it, because we won't be alive to see it anyway.","2019-12-29 05:32:12","1","oxiumodium","1747940876.492474","our planet is dying","manual"

Its weird. But I also think about where was I before existing, probably nowhere. These things of annihilation only feel dreadful because we are alive, and living things have survival programmed into them, and to know you are only delaying your inevitable death freaks the mind out, but when we die we wont know we're dead, so idk. I cant say Ive accepted it, but I just dont think about it. I just see it as another part of life, the conclusion of the play.","2019-12-29 05:55:02","1","[deleted]","1747940876.4941702","our planet is dying","manual"
"fccrof5","t3_eh1xsy","eh1xsy","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","All of what you say appears to be true and I believe it as well, but the moment matters. The life you're living and what you're doing now matters now. The time of the universe cooling and breaking down may last an eternity or may be part of a cycle. But that time is very far off. And why is that time more important than the time we're living in?   

The other thing is that it's the physical material universe that will wind down and come to a halt. But what if there is more than that? It's possible that we go on and that this universe is just one of a potentially infinite number. What we learn here and experience here may somehow stay with us or change us.   

But you really don't need a spiritual outlook, Even if you knew that tomorrow everything would cease to exist forever wouldn't that make you want to live today?","2019-12-29 06:43:55","1","dog_star_","1747940876.495939","our planet is dying","manual"
