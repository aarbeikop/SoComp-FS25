"2r6on8","Conservative","unknown","A thought on race relations in the United States","Lately , our country has experienced what many are calling ""racial"" events , such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner. I just wanted to take the time to give a true viewpoint on race relations in America from the viewpoint of a minority. I am of Indian (Asian) heritage and my parents immigrated to this great country from Malaysia. They always told me that America is the greatest nation on earth and that I should love this country and assimilate but do not forget my asian culture. I grew up in rural north Texas and now live in Dallas. I grew up in a county that was literally 99 percent white and NEVER had any racist encounters. Sure there were stares and people who may not have liked us based on my parents accent or the food we eat but the media portrays the white race as a bunch of rich Klan members out to oppress all minorities. Listen people. This is simply not true. If you work hard in this nation you will succeed. Now there is no doubt that African Americans have the hardest time succeeding in this nation but it has been a constant struggle that needs to end. We are ALL in this together , Asian , Hispanic , White , and Black. We all have to work to make America a better place for all. There are some discrepencies that need to be handled such as the Eric Garner case, I honestly thought the officer should have been indicted but we need the police. We need to solve the black on black crime in this country. Hundreds of blacks die every month due to gang warfare and drug trade among other things. We should be protesting that. America is not a racist nation , in fact it has some of the best race relations I have seen on this planet and I have traveled all over Europe and Asia. We need to continue into the future united and strong.","2015-01-03 07:12:59","21","4","0.71","https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/2r6on8/a_thought_on_race_relations_in_the_united_states/","True","sharwinza2","1747836115.293507","our planet is dying","manual"

With the environmental damage the human race has inflicted on this planet it would be tempting to argue that we have been one of the worst afflictions nature has endured. There is however an alternative stance where we could be seen as the saviours of nature from it’s fated failure on Earth.

Life on earth has a best before date. 600 million years from now most plant life as we know it will have gone extinct as their photosynthesis mechanisms fail in a world with dwindling carbon in the atmosphere and with it the food chains that support multicellular life. 1 billion years from now only simple single celled life could possibly exist and 300 million years after that all cells with a nucleus will fail. Some simple prokaryotes could linger another 1.5 billion years until the temperature of the planet rises to 147 degrees Celsius. These dates may seem too far into the future to worry about, after all our common ancestor with the chimpanzee lived only a mere 5 millions ago. Our existence as a species is a blip on this time-scale, but this time-scale is just a blip in the longer time-scales that life could survive if it were to be spread throughout the galaxy with the aid of an intelligent civilised shepherd species such as us.

Stars are our life givers and as long as they exist a galactic civilisation will be able to sustain life by moving from dying systems to new ones until the days that only stellar remnants like white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes exist. Those days will only start 10 to 20 trillion years after the last stars in our galaxy are formed which could be anywhere between 1 trillion and 100 trillion years from now. Perhaps a galactic civilisation will work out new technologies to sustain life through the degenerate era when the sky is dark from the lack of stars, if it does this could extend earth’s legacy to a nonillion(1030) years from now when the galaxy has ejected or absorbed into it’s supermassive black hole core all stellar remnants, brown dwarfs and planets. To let life fail in its minuscule infancy as we would be if we let nature take it’s course here on Earth would be the worst negligence and tragedy we could inflict.

With a deadline for us to go galactic so far in the future, perhaps it could be said that it should not be an immediate goal, and that perhaps a wiser species will emerge after the humans are gone that could fulfil this shepherding goal. First I would say that life’s doom may be sooner than the final dates mentioned above. Asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes and gamma ray bursts are only a sample of the mass extinction events nature could throw at us at any given time. As (if we ignore our livestock and pet animals) humans are the largest biomass on the planet of land based tetrapods(in fact larger than all wild land tetrapods combined) it could be reasonably expected that whatever would wipe us out would wipe out any species with the potential to evolve all the features required to create a space-faring civilisation in the time frame before the inevitable end of Earth’s life support. As an intelligent civilised species has only emerged once to our knowledge in the history of our planet we must not dismiss the possibility that we are a one off fluke of evolution. We may well be the only chance life has.

The universe is without an objective meaning or purpose, it just exists. What is remarkable is that within that cold indifference the universe has become self aware on a small blue dot in the minds of it’s animal life. It is only in minds that we find any meaning or purpose: subjective purpose. Minds find their own goals and work towards them, as biological beings it is understandable that most of our purpose comes from replication. What is more fitting a goal for a mind than to help it’s ancestor’s descendants thrive as long as possible?","2015-01-14 13:40:43","93","79","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2sed61/why_we_must_colonise_the_galaxy_for_the_sake_of/","True","sznaut","1747836302.829053","our planet is dying","manual"
