I'm not sure I fully agree, but I think it's a worthwhile (short) read. 

He recommends another book (name and author escapes me now EDIT: [Fate of the World, Jonathan Schell](https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Earth-Abolition-Stanford-Nuclear/dp/0804737029/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)) which is a detailed description of what a nuclear holocaust would be like. The horror of a nuclear holocaust is not simply that you die but that humanity's whole system of meaning is wiped clean. Every person, object, project, idea, theory is simply vaporized. It's the horror of *null*. 

There are plenty of people in this subreddit who are misanthropes. (I don't think they would mind me saying that.) They see humans has fundamentally and irredeemably flawed and good riddance when they go.

That doesn't make me hopeful. I think we are fucked. And there's a high probability that we have already triggered our extinction. At best, there will be a severe drop in our quality of life globally (i.e. misery, suffering, chaos) for the coming several centuries.

The human brain can conceive of neither infinity nor nothingness.  Consequently there is a dissonance experienced when trying to conceive of humanity in general or ourselves in particular going away, going to nothingness.  The human brain has cognitive limits.

Ponder these things if they intrigue you, but expect that there are no answers.  There are primarily and perhaps, most importantly consciousness and an awareness of that consciousness.  Sweet!  What more could you ask for - eternal life?

"dggi7ri","t3_668f6k","668f6k","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","""does space have an up or down""
the answer is no. up and down are simply ideas people have invented based on a basic point we can all agree on: on earth, up means away from the center of the planet, down means towards the center of the planet.

if you launched a rocketship at the moon from earth, from the north pole it might look like it was travelling up towards the moon rightsideup, and from the south pole it would look like it was travelling upsidedown, down towards the moon. the directions only matter from where you're standing when you look.

astronomers have invented definitions of what counts as which direction in space, but they're only based on something we've agreed to call the same thing. there's no special reason why we couldn't call one direction west in space and the other east, we've just chosen to pick certain places to define as east and west.

as for your question about stars: light-years are a measurement of -distance-, not time, even though they're called years. a light-year is the distance it takes a piece of light to travel in a year. we use it because measuring the distance in something like miles or kilometers is so big that the number of zeroes starts to make no sense (1 light year is about 5,840,000,000,000 miles).

the reason we don't have stars near our sun or the moon or mars is because stars form in *systems*. billions of years ago, big clouds of matter, of *stuff* gathered in incredibly giant clouds. each of these clouds was incredibly far away from eachother. over huge amounts of time, many of these clouds formed what are called solar systems; like ours. most of the matter, the stuff, in these clouds, fell down into the center, drawn together by gravity, much like water swirling around a drain. eventually, enough matter was pressed together by this gravity, that it generated incredible amounts of heat, and by very complex processes formed into a star, our sun. 

the rest of this stuff, swirling around the sun, eventually turned into their own smaller swirls, but they weren't big and hot enough to turn into suns, so they turned into planets like earth and mars.

the same thing is what created all the other stars in the sky, but they're so far away, that we can barely see them, and they're just dots in the sky. 

this is also why they call them ""dying""; we see things because light bounces off a thing, then hits our eyeballs, and then our brain can see it. normally this is almost instant because light is so fast. but we are talking about incredibly huge distances, and even light is not instant. when you look at the sun in the sky, it actually took 8 minutes from the sun's light to reach your eyes, so you are seeing what the sun looked like 8 minutes ago. when you look at the stars, depending on which one, you might be looking at a star from 4 years ago, to hundreds, thousands, billions of years ago. 

this is why we call those stars ""dying""; those stars might already be long gone and burned out, but we still see the pictures, the light, from those stars when they were still ""alive""","2017-04-19 06:32:33","1","cactuschef3","1747883476.463501","our planet is dying","manual"

So directions like up, down, left, right. North, West, East, South. These are always relative to the observer or some other ""static"" frame of reference. There is no north in space, that's purely a planet thing. If we went to the Mars, we could use these names for directions.

And if we went to larger scale, you could indeed say we have to go ""up from the Plane of the Solar System"". But left and right wouldn't make much sense because of the rotation - there is nothing to lock the left and right.

""Ok so we fly to the moon in our space ship i get that. But if I was looking at this happen from me floating in space what direction would they be going. ""
Hard to understand what are you asking. But that would just be determined how is the stuff in your space shuttle orientated. If moon was straight above your space kitchen table, then you would say you going up. Thats all.

""Also can I go up or down in space or is just all in a straight line? ""
In space you move in orbits because of the gravity of planets and stars. We send out space probes in a straight line, but this path is curved by gravitation. Up and down are meaningless as said.

Stars in the sky are not things dying many light years away. They are INCREDIBLY MASSIVE HUGE fusion reactors very much alive. And many of them have planets also. It's easier for us to find out that they have big gas planets, finding earth sized planets is very hard. Sun is our star. Reason why there is not a second star next to is because of gravity, they would be fused together.","2017-04-19 17:09:55","1","Sabull","1747883476.469564","our planet is dying","manual"

so? why would it? veganism is about the animals. there are other discussions for humans. 

>Of the over 7 billion humans on this planet, how many can't get enough food to eat, and go hungry daily?

a fraction of the animals brutally tortured for the sake of tastebuds. that's how many.

if you want to know whose suffering is worse, it's the animals hands down. trillions of sentient creatures abused and exploited every year. it's by far the biggest massacre ever.

Rather than argue against it, I suggest you propose an alternative.

>UBI is a dangerous philosophical roadblock that prevents society from progressing the thought paradigm beyond asking if income, or money itself is even necessary.

UBI is a temporary band-aid. Eliminating money altogether is a much better outcome, yes. Nobody needs to waste their time trading around little green pieces of paper in a hypothetical future world where everybody has access to a matter replicator.

But how do you _get_ to that point without breaking anything? Our current system assumes that people will be able to trade their labor for money in order to buy things to survive. We don't have 100% automation yet and it's unlikely to happen overnight. If automation proceeds _gradually_, so that we do still need _some_ people working but not enough to supply everyone with a wage income, 10% automation 20% automation, 50% automation, etc. UBI is a functional ""band-aid"" in that it forces money to continue circulating and keeps our basically capitalists society running during the transition.

Then yeah sure, get rid of money once everything is automated. Bring on Star Trek, I'm all in favor.

But we don't _have_ the matter replicators just yet.

>The time given back to us through automation accomplishing tasks humans otherwise would have been forced to do manually is a economical blessing, and an indication that we're approaching a post-scarcity society.

Yes. And that's great. But how do you propose to keep society running during the couple decades it might take to get from where we are today to the point where post scarcity is here?

If you don't like basic income, that's fine. Give us an alternative that isn't burying our heads in the sand and insisting that an infinite number of new jobs that for some reason can't be automated will magically always keep appearing. It seems you _don't_ think that will happen. Ok, so what's your alternative solution instead?

Imagine hypothetically that 100% of all jobs will be eliminated over the next 40 years, in random unpredictable fits and spurts of 1% to 5% in any given year.

What do you propose we do about that?

> If the majority of public necessities are met through automation, the economy should be redesigned as a resource based system rather than supply side

That's...vague. What exactly do you suggest?

The real world isn't like a Starcraft map with a pile of ""resources"" sitting in the corner that you simply scoop up. Goods and services used by humans aren't scooped up either. 80% of all US jobs are already in the service sector. _Most_ people's work doesn't material ""resources"" at all.

So let's imagine that in 5 years, half of all retail, food service, and transportation jobs are automated. But the other half aren't. How does a ""resource based"" system accommodate that? Those 15 million or so people now out of work still need goods and services to survive, but the other 15 million who haven't been replaced yet are still working.  So you want some of them to keep working, but you want the ones who aren't working to not starve to death over the couple years it will take to automate their jobs too.

What do you do about that? The goods and services they consume, again, aren't ""resources"" you can simply go collect from somewhere. They're produced _by humans_, and humans generally want to be compensated for the work they do.

"dglirnp","t3_66rspb","66rspb","futurology","unknown","> Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.

And now you suggest ~~they~~ we should infest other planets too, and start developing strains? :(

More seriously, who should decide what kind of humans goes where? Its a lot better that its done naturally, even if that ends up being grouped by random quirks of privilege and access. Humans will start to diversify once they get far enough away from each other anyway.","2017-04-22 09:34:33","1","empty_other","1747883983.7723038","our planet is dying","manual"

More and more advanced thinkers are putting reptilians at the top of this galactic battle of good and evil. I think it's time to accept that reptilians are the real deal. Again, excellent post.
