"3uzgr3","futurology","unknown","Is This Really The End","I look at the world news. . I try to stay mostly up to date in world relations. It's not something I dedicate mass amounts of time to but a pretty significant amount of time is put into it when I do. So now even seeing the things I see, reading religious texts, listening to conspiracies, just taking in everything that I can see happening. All the stories from different sources so as not to get too biased of a view... and even if I was the one who discovered and pin pointed the time and date, what would I do? So my opinion that follows is what if all the crazy shit that's happening while we're on this planet in our time.. is just our version of the end.. I'm sure throughout history... all sorts of bullshit happened and people thought it was the end or their day..  but all our days come to an end. . No matter what. . It's no ploy of god, it's humanities way of coping with the chaos of the universe, but I'm sure that's been thought of before. But like I think we're just spending our time, playing around on this giant playground we were fortunate enough to evolve on, into this beautifully destructive species that refuses to leave questions unanswered and boundaries unpushed. Now that being said.. do you think it matters whether I spend my life, chillin doing basic work and just paying for my normal stuff and drugs and fading into existence.  Or push to make a mark on reality that could quite possibly be the reason we continue on as a species.. or last go out with a bang like our great ancestors before, beyond the life, when we were still stars, exploding in a blaze and fury spreading the elements across the vacuum so that new life may move forward, like when trees die and are decomposed and redistributed to who ever needs it. I think God pulls us to the spiritual side of reality. But there's no use in stressing unless you want to..

"3ynwk2","conspiracy","unknown","Factory Farming, A Modern Day Holocaust","I have been a long time lurker on /r/conspiracy, wanting to learn about the perversion and corruption of governments and oppression on their own people. However, I am surprised to see little discussion on the oppression of animals by factory farms, which represents, in my opinion, one of the most hidden conspiracies on our planet. In this post, I would like to expose you to the torture and suffering that farm animals encounter on a daily basis, the terrible environmental impacts of factory farming and health risks associated with the regular consumption of meat. 

**Animals are objectified as a commodity**

Did you know that [90 billion farm animals](http://awfw.org/factory-farms/) die each year to satisfy the world's increasing demand in meat and diary products? Farm animals are raised in confined and inadequate stalls, where they have high risks of developing infections, wounds and atrophy of their muscles due to the lack of exercise. In [Lucent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArL5YjaL5U), a documentary mainly about pig farming in Australia, it is said that sows are usually killed at the age of two years old due to their deteriorating health condition. Pigs normally live up to 20 years old. Their meat is commercialized regardless of the potential infections they could have. Another documentary, called [Earthlings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB_ZMiYy_OQ), exposes how farm animals are mistreated during their whole lives, from their birth to their slaughtering. For example, male chicks are crushed alive shortly after their birth and the beaks of the remaining chicks are slightly cut so as to prevent them to hurt each other in their confined environment. Earthlings also shows footage of different types of slaughtering practices : halal, kosher and “conventional”. Independently of slaughtering practices, animals suffer tremendously. The halal practices are particularly barbaric because it requires that the animal dies from losing all its blood. As critical thinkers, I find it inconceivable that we allow ourselves to be insensitive to the pain felt by these animals. Animals are sentient beings and that has been extensively demonstrated in scientific studies. In scientific studies, mice are used as models of autism, depression and anxiety (If you are interested, I could elaborate more on that topic, having a scientific background). If we can use animals as scientific models to understand human thought and experience, how can we say, on the other hand, that it is morally acceptable to let go the intrinsic values of animals in factory farming practices?

**Factory farming is an environmental disaster**

Did you know that factory farming accounts for 32,000 million tons of CO2 per year, or [51%](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294) of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions? In light of this statistic, is it surprising to see that leaders at the COP21 summit have not adopted resolutions intended to reform factory farming practices.
In the [Paris Agreement text](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf), one of the resolutions is to “[recognize] the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger”. If the consumption of meat was drastically reduced, more land would be available for growing vegetables and legumes to end hunger. In this context, the COP21 summit seems highly biased at not addressing the issues related to meat consumption. For more information about the environmental impacts of factory farming, I suggest you watch the [Cowspiracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRQ3Nmnu9yw) documentary.

**Meat consumption leads to various illnesses**

The amount of [antibiotics](https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/were-eating-less-meat%E2%80%94-using-more-antibiotics-farms-ever) administered to farm animals in the US is on the rise and contributes to the increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogens that kill thousands of people every year. In addition, growth hormones are being given to livestock and cows also receive sexual hormones. These hormones could have developmental effects in children. Growth hormones could also favour the progression of [cancer](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hormones-in-food.html). A vegan diet, on the other hand, is more beneficial for health since it implies a reduction of fat and protein intake. The following website lists [57 health benefits of adopting a plant-based diet](http://www.nursingdegree.net/blog/19/57-health-benefits-of-going-vegan/). In addition, the Standard American Diet encourages a protein consumption that is too high for our physiological needs. The human body is best suited for the digestion of carbohydrates: for example, their digestion begins with the amylase found in the saliva and continues in the intestines with the pancreatic amylase. Proteins, on the other hand, require the activity of several proteases that act in the stomach and intestines. In opposition to carbohydrates, the digestion of protein produces ammonia and urea, which must be treated and excreted by the kidney, because they contain nitrogen. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, merely contain carbon and oxygen atoms and thus do not produce toxic byproducts. If we look at fruit, vegetables and grains, some of them contain molecules that regulate insulin resistance, such as [oats](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=54). An adequate modulation of insulin resistance leads to a better control of blood glucose levels and fat formation and retention. Such compounds do not exist in meat.

To conclude, animal suffering in factory farms is widespread and as rational beings, it is our moral duty to condemn this oppression. By adopting a plant-based diet, you drastically reduce your carbon footprint and by eating plenty of vegetables and fruit, you will see positive changes in your health and your life.

Here is [a list](http://www.shellethics.com/ethics/ultimate-arguments-against-veganism/) of common arguments against veganism and their rebuttals.

"3y500w","conspiracy","unknown","What is the conspiracy behind global warming?","Genuinley curious, not trying to hate on anyone.

I see people deny it a lot here, what's the conspiracy behind it? The greenhouse effect is so simple. Greenhouse gasses are trapped, warming the planet, humans release more and more over time, having a dangerous effect on our climate. Millions die from pollution in China alone. This is a very unhealthy future for humanity.

I've noticed that links denying it get 100+ upvotes, but proof the opposite way gets hardly any. Is this one of those conspiracies that is spread simply because it goes against the 'mainstream' idea? Or is it about government regulation? 

I'm just curious because my stepdad denies it as well. If I show him evidence he doesn't really care/prove me wrong. He's not a conspiracy theorist or anything. To be fair, I think he just has fun annoying me at this point.

Would like some input, TY.
