Albedo effect of tundra vegetation accelerates global warming
Posted on April 5, 2012 by Science News Releases

Climate change has increased vegetation in Arctic tundra regions. According to a recent study, the increase in vegetation in tundra regions may further accelerate global warming.

There is money to be made off of the things killing our planet - large companies, deforestation, oil fuel, etc. 

So the people with power and money who could most easily stop climate change choose to look the other way. It is sad. ","2019-03-24 18:15:27","3","BenjiLeigh","1747924580.451054","our planet is dying","manual"
"eja70h4","t3_b4zfe4","b4zfe4","environment","emotional","Love the passion, agree with your messages.. however.

Communicating in this format of passion will lead to communicative barriers from those that need the most influencing. People tend to resist change, they dislike it. Unfortunately, we as a species are extremely ignorant.. and most appeal for the convenience of ""not caring"", whether or not this is true to their actual belief. My point being, that convincing such type of person will prove difficult, particularly over circumstances that they feel are offensive to their lifestyle choices. Therefore, we need to reduce emotive responses, and approach with a rational and decisive approach. 

You're only 15, which is remarkably young to want to make the difference. Kudos to you, I wish I was more inline with my morals at that age!

What any motivated and enthusiastic individual about this issue needs to do, is exactly what you're doing (online) but back any figures and statistics up with the sources. This leads to a more convicting argument, that looks less of an opinion. Furthermore, it is equally important to look into the impact of any purchases (particularly the regular ones) on the environment, and change your buyer behaviour. For example, meat and dairy are among the leading causes of climate change. Therefore, reducing or eliminating such from our diets we can reduce our impact. Also, anything that contains plastic has been created with oil, which is a fossil fuel. So yes, by reducing or eliminating where possible the use of such will also help. Driving and our home's energy suppliers will be using non - renewable energy, also causing considerable impact. By switching to alternative providers and electric cars (if financially feasible) would be huge changes we could make. Or something we could all do it reduce how much we rely on them, walking to school/ town rather than getting a lift etc. I could go on and on, but I'll make one last point about signing petitions. If you can create a social following online, and share petitions that you feel would better impact the world, create them and sign them, share them, it all makes the difference needed to influence those in power, but also increase awareness to those that can make these individual changes also.","2019-03-24 18:41:00","4","Stingelee","1747924580.4539561","our planet is dying","manual"

It will be the outcome of the collective consciousness of humanity - all thoughts,  emotions and actions that will come about and shape the future and thus create any wonderful, horrific or simply chaotic events.

Either way, if something will happen it will be the co-creation of all of us. We are in this together and if something happens, if a collapse happens or if the Earth turns into a Utopian society, it will be because we, all of us together, have made it so.

I do believe something will happen, because it's apparent that the majority is terribly unhappy with the way things are - so they will push for change in any way they can. 

I just hope that this massive change that we are on the cusp of will come as peacefully as possible. Because if we want a different society and world many things need to change - and things can change gradually and peacefully,  as the current system is changed and enlightened from within, as another is built in its place and the existing one is transformed - OR - it can change in a very chaotic and drastic manner, though a complete and total collapse of the current system and widespread chaos.

I hope for the the first option, but it will ultimately be the entirety of humanity (as well as every specific country and region) that chooses how this awakening, that is undoubtedly already happening, will continue to unfold and manifest in our world and society.

"ei3n2od","t3_ayiwpk","ayiwpk","conspiracy","unknown","Whatever happens, I hope we perceive it correctly. Placing what we know is true into our perceptions, despite emotional weaknesses compelling us to lie, is what causes us to react and adapt the most optimally to our environment.

Don't believe that evil is tolerable. It's not to be maintained at some optimum level. It's deception created intentionally by intelligence. They are not partners in contrast or educators. They are disease causing pathogens that infiltrate, corrupt and utilize host systems in order to feed and spread. 

Having a strong immune system response is the proper response to disease. Keeping disease makes us ill and even die. It's a ploy of evil. It's like the idea that God will punish evil, so we don't have to do so. I keeps us happier, but more docile and tacitly accepting of disease.

When we no longer tolerate this disease we will non-coincidentially create a better world. We already have in the past. Now, an organized pack of disease causing pathogens threatens our freedom and pursuit of happiness. They flaunt it and rape us. Forgive them and suffer. Love them and get stockholm syndrome. They know how to hack us like this. Remember what they do and don't be like an immune system on AIDS. ","2019-03-08 22:11:14","2","thinkB4Uact","1747925874.322818","our planet is dying","manual"

"ei8f4b7","t3_azkg1g","azkg1g","conspiracy","unknown","Upon reading this I have to wonder what your motivation is here. Of all the things to be skeptical about, why climate change? Every source I’ve ever read points to humans being the leading cause, to the point where I think trying to refute it makes you look a little silly. And besides, the extent of human involvement and the damage being caused was covered up for decades by people profiting from exploiting the planets resources. Why would it be covered up at all if the real conspiracy was that we were doing *less* damage to the planet? Personally, I’d be incredibly relieved to hear that, and I’d wager that thousands of experts on climate change would be pretty relieved as well. And even if it is all hyperbole designed to frighten us (it is, and I must emphasise this, NOT), the aim is to better the planet and keep it habitable for the only known life in the universe. Do you not think that’s something worth working towards, impending doom or not? Kind of bold, is it not, to refute decades of work from experts on a dice roll that risks all life as we know it? And for what? To be a contrarian? To own the libs? I guess that’d be a pretty sweet own, killing the planet. No coming back from that one.

I don’t care whether you believe in climate change or not, because when it renders the planet uninhabitable, our descendants will die whether we accept or deny it. What I do care about is your attempt at halting progress, trying to talk people out of caring about it. This is our only planet. We are doing irreparable damage to it, and spreading doubt about that fact is not only harmful and regressive, but you’re enabling the assholes doing the majority of the damage.

It's amusing how every conference on global warming involves thousands of people clocking up millions of air miles in private jets to luxury resorts.

Climate changes. It's what it does. Climate has changed throughout the history of this planet.

16. “Yesterday’s snow… Because temperatures in the Alps are rising quickly, there will be more precipitation in many places. But because it will rain more often than it snows, this will be bad news for tourists. For many ski lifts this means the end of business.”

18. “Ice, snow, and frost will disappear, i.e. milder winters” … “Unusually warm winters without snow and ice are now being viewed by many as signs of climate change.”

19. “Good bye winter… In the northern hemisphere the deviations are much greater according to NOAA calculations, in some areas up to 5°C. That has consequences says DWD meteorologist Müller-Westermeier: When the snowline rises over large areas, the bare ground is warmed up even more by sunlight. This amplifies global warming. A process that is uncontrollable – and for this reason understandably arouses old childhood fears: First the snow disappears, and then winter.”

Die Zeit, 16 Mar 2007

20. “Warm in the winter, dry in the summer … Long, hard winters in Germany remain rare: By 2085 large areas of the Alps and Central German Mountains will be almost free of snow. Because air temperatures in winter will rise more quickly than in summer, there will be more precipitation. ‘However, much of it will fall as rain,’ says Daniela Jacob of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.”
