There is no rebuttal.

Veganism has nothing to do with starving yourself of vital nutrients. It has everything to do with an egotistical belief that you are better than everyone else merely because of the molecules you shove down your food hole. I can tell you without a doubt that the food you are withholding is going to be your downfall. Joint pain, sterility, slow metabolism, lower body temperature, hair loss, severe muscular and skeletal deficiencies–not to mention the mental and emotional problems that will arise as a result. Upton Sinclair, author of The Jungle, had to abandon veganism because his mind and body were not able to function on a diet of mere fruits, vegetables, juice, nuts, and seeds. Gandhi, once a proud supporter of the vegan movement, declared their ideas were fraudulent, stating, “No wonder that mortality figures are on the increase and there is a lack of energy in the people. It would appear as if man is really unable to sustain life without either meat or milk products. Anyone who deceives people in this regard or countenances the fraud is an enemy of India.”","2015-12-29 18:03:03","-11","Thrice_Baked_Ham","1747856000.835892","our planet is dying","manual"

"cyalolq","t3_3y500w","3y500w","conspiracy","unknown","The Rockefellers and many of the foundations sponsored by the elite had a set of agendas they wanted enacted.

A world government, fewer people, control of resources.

There are some other agendas, but we can start with these. To make their agenda a reality, they pursued many means of population control, many ways to bring about a world government and basically already had resource control. 

CO2 is exhaled by all people and is part of each and every human transaction. There are methods to avoid it, power sources that don't produce CO2, but they are not discussed by the global warming crowd.

Exxon is now being portrayed as the ""bad guy"" in global warming. This is true, but not how the media tells it. Exxon published 53 papers supporting AGW. Exxon belonged to the Rockefellers and they were driving the message of AGW through Exxon and other resources. 

It's important to understand the depths of the Rockefellers influence and connections. At the turn of the 20th century, the Rockefellers took over the American Medical Association and made it into what it is today. They took a bunch of everyday Joes and made the idea of a doctor as a status symbol, highly paid and godlike. They simultaneously ensured that diseases would be treated rather than cured and the pharmaceutical companies treating the diseases would be Rockefeller companies. 

People couldn't become doctors without the AMA, they could be dismissed from the AMA for curing people.

They did kind of the same with climate science. The history of climate science is a bunch of people jumping on board with the current trend and not being able to explain it, with some being extremely alarmed about it. This happened during the dust bowl, the 50s to the seventies were a scare of global cooling, and then the uptick in temperature came about and a new thing to jump on board and cause alarm over was put in place. But this time the Rockefellers were there.

The Rockefellers of course provided the land and helped the UN get started as the follow up to the League of Nations which they also got started. Both these groups essentially were moves towards a world government.

Maurice Strong started the IPCC and gave them their raison d'être: find human influence on the environment. Maurice Strong was a high school drop out, from Canada, who found himself living in the apartment of a wealthy and influential New Yorker at the age of 19. He was introduced to the Rockefellers and went into the oil business. He helped make Canada dependent on foreign oil and then was put in charge of PetroCanada to get Canada independent from foreign oil.

And then just as the uptick in temperature occurs, he becomes:

> Secretary General of both the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, which launched the world environment movement, and the 1992 Rio Environmental Summit, he was the first Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

He establishes the IPCC and then 600 scientists are set to work to determine ""man's influence in the climate"" during a warming period.

Man's influence was then obviously to warm the climate and CO2 was a good scapegoat for the cause. People make lots of it, it in fact encompasses every facet of human life.

So they rolled with CO2. 

The next step is to get the world to start funding the problem. All that we need to do is fund this world body with a payment from every aspect of our life and also give them the ability to enforce. Enforce against every aspect of our life.

The Rockefellers turned climate scientists into many superstars with very good salaries. And anyone who goes against their story is attacked all around. Only few older scientists are willing to cross them. Young scientists who object to the theory just don't get hired.

The models have been completely wrong. Antartica's ice is growing. No hotspots were found, the temperature hasn't risen in 18 years of the greatest CO2 output, there is no past evidence of CO2 driving warming.

And you can see from the truly ""religious"" believers in global warming what their sentiments are (many leading advocates for global warming have instructed their followers to ""stay on message"" i.e. don't say shit like:) ""I'm not going to have kids"", ""Humans deserve to die"", ""Deniers should be imprisoned"".

Anyways, we have 25% energy poverty in my province. Last year the models predicted a ""mild"" winter with ""high confidence"", it turned out to break the record for the coldest winter, broke the snow record, was what many contractors for snow removal based their prices on and got screwed for. 

Their policies and belief in their models which have never been right cause havoc. Less access to energy and people taking taxes for CO2 will certainly result in terrible consequences. But they've prepped their faithful for this. Part of studying climate change is to go through moral dilemmas where they basically tell you to save humanity you need to be willing to kill most of it.

The thing that makes it most obvious are their lack of solutions. Thorium can prove a thousand years of energy with no CO2 emissions, but they won't mention it. Biofuel is supposed to be producing 3000 gallons per acre of marginal land, but gets no mention. 

I could go through a long list of technologies that exist and are competitive but are not promoted. 

An interesting example is Lomberg. First, I completely disagree with his ideas, but the funny thing is he completely agrees with the premise that CO2 causes warming, but suggests that trillions of dollars aren't necessary to deal with it.

For that, he is called a denier. He proposes solutions, and so he is a denier.

Climate Change is the apocalypse for athirst/would be scientists. And to say it can be prevented is sacrilege. 

That's the basic story of climate change.","2015-12-25 02:17:44","25","[deleted]","1747856013.65621","our planet is dying","manual"

>All this, and more, in spite of rising levels of CO2. It seems that nature just doesn't want to play ball with the UN and its anthropogenic climate alarmism.

>We've seen a 40% greening of the planet, crop yields are up and the plants are loving it. CO2 only exists in the atmosphere at a level of around 0.04%. Of that very small amount only 3% is man made. Heck, ants all over the world produce ten times more CO2 than humans do each year. Is ant CO2 good but human CO2 bad?

>Did you know that if CO2 levels dropped to 150ppm all plant life on the planet dies? By all estimates, before humans came along and started putting CO2 back into the atmosphere, from whence it came, the planet only had about 2 millions years left before reaching that catastrophic level. Levels of CO2 are still less than 400ppm, which is less than ideal for plants to flourish. As an example, owners of agricultural greenhouses pump in extra CO2 up to levels of 1,200ppm so that plants will grow more efficiently and with higher yields.

>The UN is an unelected political body that is using anthropogenic global warming as a means to change the world order and accrue power unto itself. Their Sustainable Development document, which I have read in its entirety, is nothing short of a blueprint to establish a technocratic socialist world order. It's a centrally planned nightmare. If the 20th century is anything to go by, this new version of global socialism will cause way more harm than good. Central planning and socialism in general just doesn't work.

>I have also taken the time to download and analyse John Cook's 97% scientific consensus paper with the data. It's a scam. That guy, who lives just up the road from me, literally, faked that consensus. There was nothing like the consensus he claimed there was. In fact, based upon his data, it's more like a 0.3% consensus if you don't group unrelated categories or include papers that have nothing to do with AGW. If you knew anything you would know that the only place you'll find a scientific consensus is at the UN. The Petition Project, where 31,487 scientists have signed a document stating that AGW is not real, refutes the consensus claim, as does the survey conducted by the Scottish, Climate & Energy Forum.

Pollution is obviously a problem and, of course, we should be trying to get ourselves off fossil fuels. But there is no scientific experiment that proves CO2 emissions are responsible for Global Warming. Climate Change is statistical analysis, it is not science. If I am wrong, please explain the methodology of the experiment that proves CO2 is directly responsible for the increase of global temperature.

>  but proof the opposite way gets hardly any

What proof? There is only ""scientific consensus"". Consensus IS NOT science. Once upon a time, there was consensus that the Earth was flat and that the Earth was the center of the Universe. Do you know what the scientific gatekeepers called Galileo and Copernicus? ""Deniers"". 

That being said, I believe that CO2 is a huge pollution problem and for that alone we need to get off fossil fuels. But remember, if the Government and Elite think that climate change is seriously a ""national security threat"", then why are there still [3000 renewable energy patents classified by the patent office?](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/pdf/USCODE-2011-title35-partII-chap17-sec181.pdf) Wouldn't you think they'd release new energy devices to the public and subsidize them? Wouldn't you think they'd stop subsidizing the Oil companies in favor of renewable energy? 

Furthermore, think about the solution being presented. The only ""solution"" to the problem anyone is talking about is a [Global Carbon Tax](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122826696217574539). So if that gets passed, the UN will have a brand new bureaucracy that collects taxes from Americans and a bunch of other countries. For all intents and purposes, we will be beholden to a new form of government that will collect taxes and make decisions about our industry and the industry of many other countries. The UN will be able to stop small countries from developing their industry if it is deemed that they are producing too much Carbon. This is about control, not saving the world. Will we be able to vote on the people making decisions in this new government? Of course not. No taxation without representation.

""Climate Change"" is a smoke screen being used to set up a new form of government. They are playing on everyone's heart strings and humanity to trick people into paying a new tax that *will not do anything*. Do you think Climate Change would just magically reverse course and everything would then be cool? Of course it wouldn't be in reality but the MSM would start reporting ""We've saved the world! We've done it! No need to worry about Climate Change anymore because now you're paying taxes directly to the UN and now the problem is solved."" Meanwhile the Oil companies will continue to receive their subsidies, pollution will continue to get worse and worse, and all the inventions that could change the world will remain suppressed and hidden in the black projects going on in the bottom levels of S4 and Area 51.","2015-12-25 06:36:24","2","[deleted]","1747856013.674678","our planet is dying","manual"
"cyaxro3","t3_3y500w","3y500w","conspiracy","unknown","Conspiracies happen and operate all the time. If you've had a job you've seen little conspiracies at work. Perhaps there's a bigger conspiracy that keeps customers coming in. You, me, and everyone reading this, are probably involved in one or more conspiracies right now. Not all conspiracies are bad, or even carried out maliciously.

Most people don't know why they believe what they think to be true. We may be subject to conditioning, propaganda, peer-pressure, or lies. A lot of the time though what we believe comes from ""experts"". We recognize our ignorance and so rely on others to guide our thinking. Once we see that thinking in a particular way gets positive results we resist change.

I don't believe that the entire pro-AGW community is involved in conspiracy. Some, like the more well-known advocates, have flesh in the game and so will go to any lengths to obfuscate and pontificate when holes appear in the theory or predictions. Others are simply dependent on AGW for their livelihoods and so will not hear opposition. Take for example the IPCC. We all laugh when prominent believers are tripped up and aren't aware of basic details. But if you're convinced that you're correct and have built a career around it, you have a vested interest in protecting your position. 

While there may be a large-scale conspiracy we can't assume that to be so. We do see a number of smaller, inter-related conspiracies though, and most of those have to do with money. AGW is called, and considered, settled. Being outside of a settled theory carries professional and personal cost. Many researchers, journals, and others connected tangentially to AGW let their real self-interest guide their thinking.  

AGW is a cause for environmental concern and is therefor a political ""mommy"" issue. Mommy issue have huge traction in the public mind. Is it any wonder that AGW skeptics are so vilified? Taking a stance against AGW evokes the same visceral response as being against motherhood itself. People don't know why they're upset but they're willing to strike down all opposition if that makes them feel better. AGW is not so much a huge conspiracy as it is a cultural phenomenon that has the same effect.   ","2015-12-25 13:41:57","3","Sucks_2_B_U","1747856013.6780212","our planet is dying","manual"

climate change was pushed after pollution was deemed too nebulous to act on.   The stakes were seen to fit the agenda for alarmism.

The effort to control the agenda started with money but now the pro-sovereignty crowds have been stimulated into siding with the climate change deniers.    Very interesting and slightly amusing.   Also cringe-worthy.

Its akin to the environmental movement turning pro-nuclear power.   Even to the point of embracing the efforts to claim that the damaging effects of Chernobyl and Fukushima were being blown out of proportion and supporting the reactivation of nuclear plants in Japan,   and condemning the closure of nuclear plants in Germany.

Information and misinformation are truly the new battlegrounds.

My takeaway is that each issue has to be investigated without reliance on the franchise of the media channel we heard it from.    The story being broken is the hero,    not the messenger.    Too many messengers have let a little bit of notoriety go to their heads,   and are distracted by their attempts to profit by the status that their message could afford them.

In other words,  we need to ask questions faster than the media channels can decide for us what the real issues are.    Right now,   the climate change deniers are fixated on the problems of correlating climate change with human industrial activity.    Millions dying from pollution are not of concern to them,  evidently.

We can all be distracted by a Judy Wood from time to time.    That doesn't mean that Richard Gage is perfect either.    But the real stories stand the test of time.    And the lies do end up getting exposed.    

In the long run,   those who do not come clean on their mistakes are shown to be self-promoters more than they were committed to the truth.

In the long run,   the statistical correlations of human activity with climate interference will prevail.    What other natural event on the planet was the equivalent of man's consumption of fossil fuels over the last 100 years?   Merely by volume of impact of the mined and burned (vaporized into the atmosphere) of coal,  natural gas,  and crude oil?    How much is just 80 million barrels of oil a day?   That would be 19,000 normal sized supertanker loads a year for global demand.    Every year.    If you can't imagine this  having an effect on the greenhouse effect,   I would call that make believe.   http://gadgetopia.com/post/6118  And remember,  that does not include mountains of coal every year,   or the deforestation of Indonesia or the Amazon.

It reminds me of the dismissal of the Gulf oil spill a few years back,   the dismissal of the toxic effects of the dispersants (corexit) that were sprayed in the Gulf.     The deal is that the media can suppress the news of the impacts to life,   and that other news events eventually drown out the chatter.    

Only this time,   we are rolling much bigger dice.","2015-12-25 04:32:37","1","rockytimber","1747856013.688877","our planet is dying","manual"

Carbon dioxide, known as CO2, is part of the oxygen and carbon dioxide cycle. Lifeforms other than plants, on land, breathe oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Plants breathe carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen.

If there is any dispute it could be what chemicals are not good for the atmosphere as well as what terms to apply to such a topic. As far as a conspiracy is concerned maybe, eco-fascism?
