"9i9dpl","vegan","unknown","A sign of the changing times!","My dad was always the biggest meat eater that I knew. He was most definitely the ""but bacon though"" guy that we've all argued with at one point or another and it used to drive me bonkers because I knew that he loves animals, nature, and the environment, and almost every man in our family has died of prostate cancer or diabetes and if he didn't change his diet, he could be the next one. 

Several months back he made a joke about wanting to unfriend me on Facebook because of my vegan posts, but then also told me that he had a profound experience at the grocery store where he couldn't bring himself to by meat from the deli counter as he usually did, because he didn't see meat- he saw the bodies of animals behind those glass cases and it really irked him. I was pretty encouraged by this because it meant that he was finally starting to see behind the curtain and that going vegan would hopefully be his next move. 

Well the best thing ever happened shortly after. Earthling Ed came on a tour through Texas and I took my dad to meet him. Within a week of meeting earthling ed, sure enough, my dad went full on vegan. It's been about 4 months and he's still vegan and LOVING it. He was telling people (and himself) that he's vegan for the planet and that the animal aspect of it is just a perk so I let him borrow my copy of Jonathan Safran-Foer's book, Eating Animals. 

A couple weeks ago he and I were hanging out and I asked him how the book was. He told me that it's interesting but that he's not having fun reading it because of how intense it is. Then he told me that he had a pretty interesting dream the night before. He had a dream that he was in a grocery store and got kicked out for doing activism and putting signs all over the egg cartons showing the conditions on egg farms. He went to another grocery store and did the same thing until he got kicked out, and then went on to the next store. My dad is literally dreaming of doing FREAKING ACTIVISM YALLLLL! I'm so encouraged by the complete 180 he's made from his ""but bacon tho"" days and I'm hoping I can get him out to an actual activism event asap! I am so proud of him and I didn't realize I could love him more than I did, but I do. If my dad, of all people, can be convinced to go vegan, than anybody can! 


TL;DR: my hardcore carnist dad went vegan and is having dreams of doing direct action activism in grocery stores

"9jkgik","vegan","unknown","Appalled","I am a highly empathetic person, and recently I have begun to recognize the extent of abuse that has and is taking place on our planet. And it saddens me so deeply it just destroys me to see this happening. I have already decided to dedicate my life to spreading veganism. But it isn’t enough. I know when I truly acknowledge the horrors of this reality that my soul will die. Does anyone have any coping mechanisms to share?
