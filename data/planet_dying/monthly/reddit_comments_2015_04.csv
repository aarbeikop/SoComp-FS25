"cq8r4yq","t3_3261f3","3261f3","vegan","unknown","In my experience, it literally makes no difference what answer you give to non vegans. I could answer ""because the voices in my head tell me to"" and get the same result as if I gave an in depth factual answer. They generally already have their minds made up , they're (most of the time) not interested in changing or even hearing about veganism. They just want to ask where I get my protein and if I feel bad for eating ""all the animals' food"" ","2015-04-11 12:27:52","3","emma1308","1747841510.005908","our planet is dying","manual"
"cq8zu63","t3_3261f3","3261f3","vegan","unknown","Here's a few tips (from an omnivores perspective)-
1: don't try to bullshit science. Like your comment about an omnivores bloodstream. All you do is make it apparent you aren't interested in fact and you make it seem like you believe your opinion, no matter how lacking in research or knowledge, becomes fact. It may not convince us to change our diet, but it will feed our opinion that vegans hate science, knowledge, and basic biology. 
2: don't talk down to us. Like you started off doing. That's a great way to convert someone and make them want to listen to you...
3: realize that unlike the imaginary rights you insist animals have, people have actual rights, and freedom of choice is one of them. 
4: accept that you could very well be wrong. Yes popular opinion isn't always right, but when you hold one that's less popular than the conspiracy theory that GW Bush is a lizard alien (seriously, look up how many Americans hold that belief then compare it to the rate of veganism in the US) you have to accept that there's a good chance you're wrong about something if you think your personal views should extend to everyone else. 
And finally- don't introduce yourself as a vegan, or act like a passive aggressive emo 13 year old in the meat aisle of the grocery store, or randomly go shout at strangers who are just trying to enjoy their lunch. Vegans don't have a negative image because ""hey look, that guys eating a salad!""","2015-04-11 17:59:55","3","xander1100","1747841510.010189","our planet is dying","manual"
