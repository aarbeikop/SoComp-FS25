"csc63b9","t3_3afc1i","3afc1i","vegan","unknown","I feel like meat eating will be what smoking has become.  Even 5 years ago when I smoked, if I was out, it wasn't hard to find someone who could spot you a dart.  30 years before that it was de rigeur, and no one would have even thought of not smoking (old desks in my college had ashtrays on them.)

Now it's nearly impossible.  Almost no one smokes anymore and it's just because it reached a critical mass of being uncool and stupid.  ","2015-06-19 19:15:43","15","[deleted]","1747844992.296522","our planet is dying","manual"
"csc7ln8","t3_3afc1i","3afc1i","vegan","unknown","We need a website that we can all work from and pool our resources and focus not only on spreading veganism in multiple ways with the most important being the literal taking back of our planet from the evil that controls it.

Our current election systems are anti-democratic , Good people cannot win elections basically therefore the world is in the hands of the psychopaths. And a very large % of those  that are born into this system must , by default, systematically gravitate towards this psychopathic behavior in order to survive in the current system.

"cscg13f","t3_3afc1i","3afc1i","vegan","unknown","It'll reach a tipping point sometime soon. Maybe the next few years or next few decades but it will happen. Sometime after that eating meat will become stigmatized, similar to how homophobia and racism are stigmatized. Sometime after that meat-eating and similar exploitation may become legally abolished entirely.","2015-06-20 00:16:10","2","antiqua_lumina","1747844992.321016","our planet is dying","manual"
"cscn57y","t3_3afc1i","3afc1i","vegan","unknown","Some part of me tells me to sit back and let those ignorant fucks figure it out the hard way, let them watch their children starve and scrounge for scraps in a barren land while fighting for water, and see the world fall into disarray simply because of a selfish barbaric habit they've been so stubbornly harboring their entire, miserable lives. But then another part of me would agree with what you said, to warn them and educate them. It's misanthropy vs. mercy; I'm just having trouble figuring out which side to choose. Humans are smart, however, so maybe they'll figure all out before it gets to such a disastrous point. They just aren't being very smart at the moment.","2015-06-20 04:46:55","2","[deleted]","1747844992.3241642","our planet is dying","manual"
"cscoc8k","t3_3afc1i","3afc1i","vegan","unknown","Ethics are what made me go vegan, what animals go through just to supply us with stuff we do not need at all is absolutely atrocious. It was a 'what the hell am I doing?' moment. But environmental concerns are now the real reason I do it. 

I'd like to think that I'm pretty unselfish by not exploiting other creatures. I'd also like to think that I am being socially responsible by doing my part to not make the world a shittier place for future generations. The kids of the future have enough to deal with as it is, their parents destroying the planet does not need to be one of those issues.","2015-06-20 05:42:05","2","JrDot13","1747844992.326593","our planet is dying","manual"
"cscomly","t3_3afc1i","3afc1i","vegan","unknown","Someone sum this up for me. Too inebriated to read anything but the headline.

All I know is that environmentalism and veganism are separate. In current western culture you will see overlap in values, however. One can lead into the other. I started with environmentalism and have pointed this out on here before. Years ago I saw the damage eating meat was doing and went vegetarian. That then extended to strict vegetarian and then vegan.","2015-06-20 05:56:49","1","DustbinK","1747844992.329191","our planet is dying","manual"

If people ask me: I'll explain why it's not ethical or sustainable- but only if they specifically ask for my reasoning. Lead by example and don't be preachy. Most people don't like being told what to do when they have a choice.
