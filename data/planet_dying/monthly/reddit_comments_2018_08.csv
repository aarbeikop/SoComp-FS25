If we could make hydrogen gas (H2) from water (bacteria do it and, on a small scale, we can too), we could take that H2 and burn it with oxygen to make energy and water, which we could remake into hydrogen gas as a never-ending, nonpolluting source of energy. No CO2 in the equation. 

This was something that people looked at quite a bit about 15 years ago.  GM even built a [hydrogen-powered truck for then-governor-of-California Arnold Schwarzenegger to drive](https://newatlas.com/go/3378/), and there were several hydrogen-fueled bus demonstration projects. They generally turned out to be quite expensive to operate, and battery-electric systems have come to dominate the zero-emissions vehicle market.","2018-08-29 20:39:41","2","silence7","1747912620.405822","our planet is dying","manual"

It seems like everything that is tied to environmental destruction or the ability to act to reverse climate change effects is linked directly to an abundance of cheaply acquired energy.","2018-08-09 12:00:42","1","megatonfist","1747912674.2023091","our planet is dying","manual"
"e3vsght","t3_95vjve","95vjve","environment","emotional","Uhm, reducing emissions means to continue emitting. The CO2 doesn't go away, it just accumulates in the atmosphere.

And right now we are not even emitting at a constant rate, we're still breaking anual records.

And it's not like there are inhibiting factors, that allow for some anual CO2 emissions, that can be compensated by the ecosystem. It's the opposite, there are **positive feedback loops,** so we are past the point of no return anyways, just open your eyes, everything is accelerating, be it melting of ice all around the globe, forest fires, permafrost melting and so on. It's not magically going to stop, it's a self accelerating process for now, and hopefully we humans will see at which point the earth reaches an equilibrium again. But for now there is still a lot of ""fuel"" for this process to continue.

edit: You know, there really is a positivity creep in this discussion. We are constantly putting the tipping point further back, even the definition of ""pre-industrial"" is shifting later and later to make the numbers look nicer. There have always been those statements like ""If we don't reach peak carbon at so and so, we won't be able to blahblahblah"". Sure maybe there is some miracle or some stabilizing process that hasn't been discovered yet. Maybe, maybe not. We are breaking heat records after heat records, and that's not because of recent green house gas emissions. It's because we are doing this for a fcking century right now.","2018-08-09 12:25:33","1","Jupiter20","1747912674.205473","our planet is dying","manual"
"e3vwadx","t3_95vjve","95vjve","environment","emotional","Besides a facist or totalitarian reduction of population, what are you proposing as a solution to your assertion that we must reduce emissions by 100%

At this point it's a numbers game. 7.6 billion humans require X amount of clean water, food, and most importantly sanitation services. Not to mention heating energy.

Further, every example of 'clean energy' requires more energy to produce an inefficient collector, solar panels require an obscene amount of energy to manufacture, wind turbines are at best 40% efficient before they fail, hydro has *massive* upkeep, geothermal can't help.

After we all agree to sit still and meditate silently, how are we going to reduce the energy requirements for those humans?","2018-08-09 13:34:52","0","FalseIshtar","1747912674.207165","our planet is dying","manual"

I don’t give a fuck if your liberal or conservative, but saying “them libtards/those cuckservatives don’t belong here” or something is pretty fucked up.
