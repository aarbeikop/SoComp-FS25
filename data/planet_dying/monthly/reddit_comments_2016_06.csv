It would suck and and probably would destroy my psyche doing it, but totally worth it.","2016-06-25 07:34:23","2","[deleted]","1747866588.501021","our planet is dying","manual"
"d4nb8hi","t3_4poi87","4poi87","futurology","unknown","I'd say nearly everyone's predictions of the world in 100 years would be very inaccurate. Imagine what somebody in 1900 thought 2000 would be like.

As to the first one, in my opinion, it's doubtful that humans will die off. There is no valid, sane reason to use nuclear weapons and humans have bounced back from the worst natural disasters in natural history, such as the Toba supervolcano. 

Hopefully we have a mix of the last two.","2016-06-25 07:51:22","2","JoshtheRoman","1747866588.5038579","our planet is dying","manual"

We now have the CRISPR/cas9 DNA Search and Replace facility, imagine that we use that facility to boost IQ by 10% per generation. In a thousand years our descendants would be smarter than we are in the same ratio as we are smarter than chimps.","2016-06-25 02:02:28","0","farticustheelder","1747866588.5083241","our planet is dying","manual"
