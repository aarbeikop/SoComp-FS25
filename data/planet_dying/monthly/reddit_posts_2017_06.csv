"6kcy1j","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","You have problems of anger and managing your feelings.","So i'm a shithead, an asshole and the worst thing in the planet. A fuckhead who don't deserves anything. A fucking slob who spents money just in himself.

I feel like you and everyone else says that just to get me down, since fucking always. Even from my years of school where i had great grades and had the chance to represent our school in a fucking important contest. No one cared about it, and the funny part is that even one of you were super angry because i wasn't home to open him the door. I was 12.


Now you say that i had to put money on the table because i'm old, damn, i pay for some things and i wish i can pay a lot more but i'm a broke ass. I want to get a better job so i can help. And most important, get the fuck out of that looney tunes house.

I know i'm a shitcrapfuck who deserves to die, but i don't know why whenever you want to tell me anything you have to scream and get violent. I think you can express anything without screaming and crying and most important, without hitting me, you did it once, i didn't play along, sorry but i'm not like that.

Believe me, if i had money i will be already out of this house, i feel so bad everyday, ya'll watch the T.V and the sound is so fucking loud. Ya'll never want to make agreements so everyone in the house does chores in an equitative way.

What made me realize there's something wrong with you, is that you don't really want to solve things, everytime i was asking you what can i do to make things better, you changed subjects, and telling me that i just wanted the easy way out and that i was playing the victim, wtf dude, i want to solve things, that's how you solve things, you hear and then say what you can do about the complain and then do it, ya'know.

I hope i can leave this shitshow soon.","2017-06-30 01:47:54","2","0","0.76","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/6kcy1j/you_have_problems_of_anger_and_managing_your/","True","krpkrp1212","1747887215.652812","our planet is dying","manual"
"6f1w0g","vegan","unknown","Veganism saved my life, or at the very least, dramatically improved the quality of my life and health.","(This is my personal account of living with a bizarre condition with disturbing symptoms. Might be TMI at some parts, so if blood and the like freaks you out, you might want to skip it.)

4 years ago, I laid down to go to sleep on night and felt like I was drowning in the blood I randomly started coughing up. It was the most terrifying moment of my life. I could barely breathe. I thought I was dying of a pulmonary embolism, or that I had cancer or some other devastating illness I had never heard of. 

I was rushed to the ER and was stabbed, poked, prodded, scanned, x-rayed, etc, and was told I was perfectly fine and ""sometimes weird things just happen and it shouldn't happen again"" and was sent on my way. Except it did happen again, for around 50 months straight, linking up perfectly with my menstrual cycles. 

For the first couple of years, I would only cough up blood on the worst day of my period and never any other day. Last year, however, I went paleo after being urged by friends who wouldn't stop assuring me how great it would be for my body. I've never really been too big into meat, and I seriously upped my intake of it in a short period of time. My condition severely worsened, to the point that by the end of last year, I was coughing up large, almost black, blood clots for multiple days, even up to a week after my period had ended. The clots always matched what my period looked like at the time perfectly. 

I probably should have gone to a doctor, but I no longer have health insurance, and when I would go to a doctor they'd just scratch their heads and say everything came back ""normal"". In addition to the increased blood clots, I had much more difficulty breathing and was in so much pain. I was absolutely miserable, and my weight shot up 25 pounds last year due to low energy levels and pain keeping me very sedentary (and probably all of the ""healthy"" animal foods I was eating.)

Right around Christmas, it dawned on me that if upping my intake of animal products apparently made it worse, then maybe it would get better if I cut them out entirely. On Janurary 1st of this year, I went 100% vegan. Mostly whole foods plant based vegan, but sometimes I do eat vegan treats and pizza with daiya ""cheese"" and what not. 

I noticed a difference the very first month. I still coughed up blood, but only once, and significantly less. It was back to only happening on the worst day of my period again, instead of several days. I could breathe much easier and the pain was tolerable again. Things continued to improve each month, to the point that the amount of blood I was coughing up was so minuscule that I probably wouldn't even notice if I wasn't watching for it. 

I just finished my 6th cycle this year (also my cycles got really crazy for a few months and started coming much earlier, but have since leveled out) and DIDN'T COUGH UP ANY BLOOD. I also hiked 8 miles on my worst day and could breathe perfectly the whole time. I experienced no pain whatsoever. I can't believe it. I'm so happy I want to cry. (Side note: I also lost a bunch of weight because I'm eating so much healthier and being much more active since I'm not tired all the time anymore. So that's awesome.)

I also want to say that when I first started this journey, it was VERY difficult, social pressure and backlash from friends is INSANE, so I educated myself on all of the other reasons to go vegan, so I would stick with it. It definitely helped. Earthlings, Gary Yourofsky, Cowspiracy, Forks Over Knives, etc all helped to open my eyes to the fact that my decision is not just about me and my struggles, but the struggles of billions of animals who are tortured and killed for the meat industry EVERY YEAR. 

In a way, I'm actually thankful for what I went through, because it gave me a chance to actually open my eyes to the plight of other species and our planet as a whole. I'm NEVER going back to my old, miserable life, and I'm so thankful that I was able to heal myself by choosing to stop harming others.
