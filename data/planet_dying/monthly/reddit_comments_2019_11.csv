It is trivially easy to show experimentally, and was first shown experimentally in 1859.

Since then, we've gone on to use CO2 for infrared lasers. If you've had surgery any time this millennium, the surgeons probably used a CO2 infrared laser cauterizer to close you up. 

So yes, we know pretty damn well how CO2 treats infrared light. It traps heat.","2019-11-16 17:56:59","12","ocschwar","1747938183.003071","our planet is dying","manual"
"f7ote7z","t3_dx9bzo","dx9bzo","climatechange","action-oriented","The post reminds me of a flat earther's justification for their false beliefs. OP, you might want to [check out](https://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/documents/AQ-9%20Task%20Force%20Meeting%20%281980%29.pdf) what the American Petroleum Institute's scientists found when looking into the problems relating to CO2 concentrations building up in the earth's atmosphere in *1980*.  The atmosphere is right on track based on those old projections and we have much more data and tools today to confirm these findings.  This research was buried for decades as we were subjected to a massive disinformation campaign.  Any serious attempt to remedy the climate problems we are facing and will face in the future will look like socialism to one as yourself.  I personally feel we need  a WWII-like focus of individual and corporate sacrifice if we as a species have any realistic hope of reducing/tackling this climate problem for future generations.","2019-11-16 19:50:33","7","Swineservant","1747938183.004985","our planet is dying","manual"

Hint: look around you, all of modern technology is based on the precision and wide sharing of scientific knowledge. There is simply no way any basic stuff could be fudged. (And CO2 as a GHG IS basic stuff)

> Water vapor makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases,

"f7okkxn","t3_dx9bzo","dx9bzo","climatechange","action-oriented","Also any climate graph you look at starts around 1900 or so, around the end of the last ice age. So there ought to be warming from that period to now as we're coming out of an ice age. Medieval times was warmer than now.  


All the shit about the weather going crazy is nonsense too. It's the weather, it's always been unpredictable. We in a 42 year long period of low hurricane activity.  


The famous hockey stick graph has been refuted in the Canadian supreme court. Look it up. Some guy kept criticizing it, the guy who made the graph sued him, so he said OK show us your proof, it went all the way to the supreme court and finally the guy was like ""OK I don't have any proof"". Where is that being covered in the media?  


Most meteorologists also disagree about climate change. The criticism there is they study weather, not climate. OK well last I checked climate was twenty years of weather.  


Oh, here's another question I have, although this would be more for the deniers, if water vapor is 95% of greenhouse gases, why is no one talking about contrails? Airplanes are constantly, constantly, every time I look up at the sky, there's one or two contrails at least. And this is going on all over the world 24/7. Shouldn't that have an effect on the heat that's getting reflected back to the earth?  


Then there was the climategate scandal a few years back where there's actual emails between climate scientists talking about the tricks they use to ""hide the decline"". The media said ""oh well they're only talking about hiding the decline in tree ring samples, not the temperature."" but what are they using tree rings to indirectly measure? Temperature.   


Honestly I don't really know if climate change is real. There certainly is a major pollution problem, we're cutting down the forests faster than they can be replaced, we're using up resources faster than they can be replenished, overpopulation is a real thing, and the way we distribute resources is highly inefficient. I try to live my life having as little impact on the environment as possible, I use timers for my outlets, I take quick showers, I compost my waste (including shit and piss) to make fertilizer for my garden, I like to build most of my own stuff instead of buying whenever possible, I ride my bike instead of drive if possible.  


I honestly do not know what to think about climate change. I know there's a 97% agreement among those surveyed but I've seen some pretty strong criticism of those surveys too, so I don't know. Obviously fossil fuels are a nonrenewable resource. Obviously we can't keep driving species extinct. We can keep turning the forests into deserts. But I really don't know wtf is going on.","2019-11-16 18:30:02","-6","[deleted]","1747938183.0098188","our planet is dying","manual"
