Heartland Partners With ALEC to Roll Back Renewable Energy Sources

As a part of its 2013 agenda, ALEC partnered with the Heartland Institute to roll back the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), state-level legislation that requires utility companies to produce a certain amount of their total energy from renewable sources.[14]

Have you read about all the companies that have parted ways with Alec?

Climate science deniers have nothing left but posting bunkum from paid shills. The pause was a fallacy and we have just had the two hottest years on record back to back. 

People reading these posts aren't stupid and know how to look up peer-reviewed science. There is no great, big name climate change denying scientist is there? Not one scientist is famous for disproving climate change, not one.

They *are* talking about 100% WWS heating, transport as well as electricity by 2050.  Whether that's realistic is a very different matter.  You say that the Chinese know they can't produce PV without nuclear.  Well, until the storage problem is solved (or China builds a magical auto-self-balancing storage-less smart grid), they'll need baseload for far more than PV production.  The real issue with abandoning all fossil fuel combustion for industry is not so much electricity but the primary energy used for smelting and coking.  And at the moment one simply cannot make concrete using electricity.  There is an excellent free online book, ""Sustainable Materials with Both Eyes Open"" out of Cambridge exploring these issues, trying to do for materials what Sir David MacKay did for understanding energy (and it was he who turned me vehemently pro-next-gen-nuclear).","2016-01-26 14:04:01","2","[deleted]","1747856275.2088242","our planet is dying","manual"

I don't expect it but I really do hope socialism becomes an issue in this election. For too long Democrats have shunned the title every other left party in the world embraced. Now that Sanders is making the word more acceptable, it would be great to see a Republican properly attack the concept like Reagan, Milton Friedman, and Thatcher did.

Socialism isn't income redistribution. Milton Friedman favored extremely generous income redistribution and nobody would accuse him of being a socialist. Mere income redistribution within a democracy is more accurately called social democracy. It embraces the free market while still providing help for the poor. Socialism is government control over the means of production. Socialists do not embrace the free market. They believe the government is inherently better at allocating resources. They tolerate free markets for the wealthy since they can afford it or as long as prices seem reasonable.

There's an unfortunate disdain on the right for looking to foreign countries, particularly liberal foreign countries but I wish they would. What they would find in that the US is grossly overregulated, doesn't tax the middle class enough, taxes corporations too much, rightly taxes capital gains at a lower rate, rightly demands work for welfare, and doesn't support its private schools like it should. Yes, these other countries have higher taxes (particularly on the middle class) and more generous income redistribution (but more efficient distribution) which makes them more social democratic but in many more areas they're more capitalistic and less socialist than the US.","2016-01-29 17:10:29","8","johnmannn","1747857225.9439082","our planet is dying","manual"

"czgnks4","t3_439csc","439csc","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","* I agree, it's time to stop waiting for or believing in social messiahs -they're not coming. No one person will change the country for the best. That takes hard work and collaboration on a massive scale and can never be perfect. However, one man can fuck it all up and perfection in that regard is simple; the more anarchic the mayhem the better.

* The problem with ""Hillary is a corporate shill"" is that describes every establishment politician. That's why you're there, that's how you get things done. It's a game of leveraging favors; that's politics in a nutshell. Sanders is non-establishment, though has always been welcomed in the party. He has not gotten the cold shoulder the TEA party gets from the GOP -but he is not a ball player, except within perhaps union circles.

* Democrats didn't call Obama the messiah -Republicans did. ""Oh so let's see how well your messiah does now!"" ""Oh, dems think he's the second coming!"" Now, I suppose, they can say that right back to them about Trump but that isn't the point. Obama did try to do quite a lot of good things that would have brought change but the obstructionist congress, by their own admission, blocked it all on purpose to try and win elections. Frankly, to me that means their party, Donald being Mr. ""outsider"" or not, do not deserve the white house -or the congress. Blocking jobs bills and veterans bills for 7 years doesn't make you anyone's savior.

Thing is, the question for me is not ""Hillary or Bernie."" If I got to pick the next president all by myself, it'd be Bernie, no doubt about it. But America must face ""One of Them or Trump"" as it seems, mind-bending as it may be, Trump will be the candidate. Well, Trump , like Bernie, refuses superpac money -but then, he's a billionaire, which Bernie certainly isn't -and for me, being a billionaire isn't in your pro column when you run for president, it's definitely in the cons. We need a 1% money-worshipper and slick-n-shady business man running the country like we need to put ISIS leaders in charge of the TSA. But more to the point, Donald Trump is deeply entrenched in the business world, moving billions every day. He already has deep connections that make his policies suspect. He can stand to profit in so many ways and so can others if they toss their support behind him. He frankly doesnt need superpacs -but it doesnt mean he rejects them out of some form of morality. He knows he can do without it so it makes him look good. Big deal. Not a sacrifice -like it is for Bernie. Bernie cannot do all that Trump can do by virtue of giving up superpacs. I think he deserves to be commended way more than Trump.

So, would a Bernie presidency usher in a new era of political revolution? Yes, but I think no matter who wins, we're seeing the death of the parties as they were. The page is turning, it's not the 80s anymore. We're moving forward into the 21st century and we have no choice but to accept the change that comes along with the turning of the generations. Both parties will burn and 2 new parties will rise from those ashes with new agendas. We may even see a viable third party arise alongside them. -it may be inevitable.

As for Hillary, Bernie or Trump? Both Hillary and Trump have the connections to get shit done, to put it flatly. Bernie really does not. It's hard to move mountains with beliefs -money works a lot better, and he doesn't deal in that world. Trump, though, would skew the entire government, or cave to his party's congressional urges to skew the entire government, towards him and his rich buddies and away from you. Hillary would do as she has always done, some for you and some for her buddies. Who would make the best president as far as agenda? Bernie. Hands down. And if he wins, he will absolutely need a massive sweep of the midterms or he'll be stuck worse than Obama. Hillary, she might be able to squeeze something out of them. She's a woman, but only slightly liberal and let's face it, not black -which is half the reason right there the GOP won't work with Obama. But if Sanders loses to Clinton, I guarantee she would still be a better president for the people than Trump. It's a no-brainer, frankly. The man is an ignorant boor who will make asses of our country worse than Bush Jr did -and that's saying something.

Bernie will want to get things done, and will likely do the same. Obama is popular among democrats, and since Hillary supports many of his policies she remains the frontrunner.

That may sedate the population for a while, unless they let corporate favoritism get too out of hand. That could explode society at this rate, but I'm sure they'll concede enough to avoid it.

""[Bernie being an outsider] is why you needn't worry about the congressional makeup.

He's gonna have to do that almost entirely on his own, but the more seats he flips and the greater his win margins (votes or electoral) gives him people power behind him. The people are already there, but the lines have to be redrawn before you see wholesale national shifts. But even without that, compare any part of the country to 8 years ago and they're all more progressive. Even Texas where the voices of opposition are the loudest, they're loud because they can't stop what's happening around them.

He didn't fight for liberal or progressive positions because he didn't have them, which is why our generation is so disillusioned with him. 

But like I was saying before, we've never lived in a time where the democratic president wouldn't try to bipartisan in the name of diplomacy though there have been times when they haven't. JFK and LBJ both actively did what they thought was best regardless of what the opposing side thought about it. FDR said he welcomed the hatred of corporations and big banks.
