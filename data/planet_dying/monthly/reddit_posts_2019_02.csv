I have accepted that the end is near for us, it's obvious at every corner, culture, art, music, all of it is reflecting a doomed humanity, those three things have ushered in many things as somewhat of a prophecy or a resonance of the emotions/feelings we have as a whole. I live in australia, every day getting scarier than the last with storms and heat. I'm only 25, sometimes I sit outside in the incoming storms and cry, because I can feel the roar of this planets last few breaths before it collapses within itself, I love nature and everything in it, I always have. I HATE humans, we've always turned what we touch into ash, my hopes were always in saving the LIFE on this planet, but we're killing the hopes for that too. insect populations plummeting globally on average of 2.5% per year, and microbes within the oceans soil - some of if not the most resilient life forms on our planet, are dying. We will take everything with us in our demise.  
What will my future be? I never asked for any of this, none of us did.  
I'm scared, not alot of people say that, you know? but I think it's important to talk about the fact we're scared.  
""the acceptance of the end may be the only thing that saves humanity""

As for music reflecting fear of the world:

I've been watching you  
For some time  
Can't stop staring  
At those oceans eyes  
Burning cities  
And napalm skies  
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes  
Your ocean eyes

No fair  
You really know how to make me cry  
When you gimme those ocean eyes  
I'm scared  
I've never fallen from quite this high  
Falling into your ocean eyes  
Those ocean eyes

I've been walking through  
A world gone blind  
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind  
Careful creature  
Made friends with time  
He left her lonely with a diamond mind  
And those ocean eyes

No fair  
You really know how to make me cry  
When you gimme those ocean eyes  
I'm scared  
I've never fallen from quite this high  
Falling into your ocean eyes  
Those ocean eyes.

&#x200B;

This isn’t something I take some sort of arrogant self-satisfaction in writing. In truth it is the most depressing thing I’ve ever typed out in my drawn-out youth of half-baked high-school poetry and pandering college essays. I’m writing this because I’m frustrated. I’m frustrated by a combination of two traditional narratives I often see in regards to discussing the impending ecological collapse we typically refer to as ""climate change"". The first is that there is hope to maintain the current state of things, always of the “just enough time to act” variety, and the follow-up assumption that seems to come with that is that communicating any sense of impending “doom” or “hopelessness” will dissuade people from trying to mitigate the disaster. Articles such as the following convey this attitude (and I hope to respond directly to this article soon) - [http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/](http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/)

Personally I don’t buy into either of these narratives. The following writing, however short or long it becomes, will seek to address these narratives while simultaneously revealing a more concrete truth buried within them both. 

&#x200B;

Part 1: The Problem: 

&#x200B;

Before we go into things like the politics or response efforts to climate change (and the wider issues of ecological collapse), let’s take some time to just examine the problem itself. In this section, we will look solely at the challenges facing the global atmosphere, how that ties into the biosphere, and the nature of the problems confronting both the natural world and wider human society. 

For most people, the entry point for understanding the environmental problems as a cohesive global issue comes from being introduced to climate change. The basic premise introduced is simple: humans are emitting CO2 in the form of fossil fuel consumption, that emission of CO2 is changing (warming) the climate, and that given a long enough scale, this problem will fundamentally reshape things like coastal communities or the ability to maintain agriculture.

Many see this as the end of the journey in understanding climate change. It present a clear issue, gives it a name, describes it in an elevator-speech type format, and provides a paradoxically simple yet complex solution to solving it: Humanity must emit less CO2 over time to avoid changing the climate too radically in order to maintain the status quo of the industrialized modern world. 

Unfortunately, this narrative is intensely limited. For example, it doesn’t touch on the idea that humanity emits a multitude of gasses into the atmosphere, many of which trap far more heat than CO2.

The factory farm system has added millions of bovine to the surface of the Earth that simply didn’t exist before, and the nature of decomposing societal waste in the form of landfills is also a modern creation of the past century. Both of these processes emit an enormous amount of Methane. This is important to note because Methane actually traps 100 times as much gas as CO2 in its first year of introduction, and retains roughly 72 times the amount of heat after 5 years. There is something to be said for the fact the Methane tends to dissipate from the atmosphere after 10 years, but its ability to accumulate over that time and our continued increase of its production has largely outpaced this dissipation. - [http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/) 

(how factory farming adds to climate change.) - [https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html](https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html)

Yet even with this understanding the severity of something as simple as 1 additional chemical is downplayed. Since methane tends to be seen as more of a “burst” of heating as opposed to the “sustained” heating CO2 leads to, there is an instinct to see it as less of a threat, or at least as less of an enduring one. What this ignores however is the nature of how this type of short-term burst of heating adds to the wider cycle of climate change. 

As Methane adds to the heating cycle, it gives a boost to the melting of arctic and sub-arctic permafrost in the regions of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Russia’s Siberia. This permafrost itself contains an unknowable amount of gasses, all trapped within the once permanently frozen areas of those regions. As these areas are thawed for the first time in 1000’s of years, they release the CO2 and methane stored beneath, thus accelerating the warming cycle in a way that is outside of human influence or control. The problem is pervasive enough that scientists continue to show larger-than-expected amounts of these gasses being released into the atmosphere from this process. - [https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html)

This process gives us an introduction to the wider problem of climate change, which is the nature of its intersectionality with the wider crises facing the World’s ecosystems. Still, taken in this view the common perspective often looks to the atmosphere itself as the source of both the problem and the solution. A deeper look shows how other environmental problems tie into this process. 

Let’s take de-forestation as an example. It is no surprise to anyone who passed 3rd grade science that plants take in CO2 emitted by humans and other animals, and that they in-turn release oxygen for our consumption. This understanding leads us to a natural conclusion: the more trees we have on the planet, the better we’ll be able to regulate the escalation of gasses like CO2 and Methane. Indeed, scientists have said for a long time that the global forest systems are the best means for mitigating climate change. - [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/)

Unfortunately, looking into the rate of deforestation itself will show that we are only adding to the problem by clearing these necessary ecosystems, rather than helping to mitigate the disaster by protecting them. The amazon rainforest is perhaps the best example. Often referred to as “the world’s lungs”, it is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the planet, and is responsible for 20% of all the oxygen inhaled by every living creature on the planet. 

Despite the overwhelming importance of this region, its destruction has gone largely unchecked, ironically pushed to exploit resources that add heat to the atmosphere or for the clearing of land for industrial farming. The fact that Brazil recently elected Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier (liar) who has promised to increase rainforest “development” and shifted control of the region from the country’s environmental agency to its agricultural one, shows that this problem has little chance of slowing. - [http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/](http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/)

(Bolsonaro transfers power over the rainforest to agricultural ministry.) - [https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land](https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land)

One could be forgiven for hoping that forest protection efforts or re-forestation efforts might help make up some of this difference. Depressingly though, this is not the case. The largest bio-spheres of the planet with the largest areas of forest cover have experienced massive forest lost since 2001 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, lost 12 million hectares of forest cover in that 16 year period, with their single highest year of loss being 2017 itself at 1,470,000 hectares in a single year. For perspective, the total area of Michigan is 25,049,329 hectares. This means that the Democratic Republic of Congo alone has cleared an area of forest almost half the size of the entire state of Michigan in less time than it takes a human being to go from infancy to high-school graduation. Taken in conjunction with forest loss in other countries, the situation’s urgency begins to reveal itself. - [https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map) 

Still, not even this combination of factors is able to show the true all-encompassing nature of the environmental catastrophe we now find ourselves living through. To gain a wider picture of the problem, we should look beyond our own visible atmosphere and turn to the other 2/3rds of our planet: The Oceans. 

The World’s oceans absorb 35 - 42% of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, and over 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming. Their importance in mitigating and understanding climate change, and the nature of change that the warming climate will have on these ecosystems, cannot be understated. - [https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/)

This absorption has already begun to affect the oceans, despite the system taking about 20 - 40 years to fully react to the change. This delayed reaction means that, even if humans were to discontinue all CO2 emission today, the oceans would continue to change as a result of global warming for decades beyond that end. This is known as “The thermal intertia of the oceans.” - [https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html](https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html)

The nature of the change which has already taken place has been massively negative. Coral reefs have begun bleaching far more often than in previous decades. While bleaching events are a natural process, their increased rate means the reefs don’t have time to recover as part of the natural cycle, leading to massive die-offs of these “underwater forests” from regions such as the Great Barrier Reef. Naturally, this destruction removes sources of food for important parts of the marine ecosystem and adds to the global ecosystem’s inability to effectively react to industrial human activity. - [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/)

While the death of massive amounts of marine life is obviously catastrophic for both the planet and our dependence on the Oceans, it’s not even the only story tied into the Oceans when it comes to climate change. Another effect is seen when we look at ocean currents, which are slowing and causing changes to weather patterns already. Indeed, global climate scientists have begun to ask whether the entire Ocean current system could “stall.” Since these currents help to power and carry everything from necessary rain patterns to hurricanes and cyclones, a change in these systems would have massive effects on human life. In fact, when hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, the national weather service had to add a new color to their radar mapping system simply so they could accurately track the amount of water being dumped on the State. They had never needed to measure rain in that amount in that region in the modern history of weather analysis. - [https://e360.yale.edu/features/will\_climate\_change\_jam\_the\_global\_ocean\_conveyor\_belt](https://e360.yale.edu/features/will_climate_change_jam_the_global_ocean_conveyor_belt)

Hurricane Harvey color added: - [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains)

Taken in conjunction with these problems, let’s finish by looking at how climate change can affect global weather patterns. While the hurricane example above is a good example to show how the change in the oceans from climate change helps propel a change in the weather, even this link is not a full view of the intersectionality which climate change represents. 

Perhaps the greatest immediate threat some developing countries will experience as climate change progresses isn’t the flooding of coastal cities, but rather the restriction or even complete eradication of water sources and localized water cycles. Many nations hosting millions of people rely heavily on localized water cycles for their populations. Pakistan, for example, requires snowfall in its northern region during the winter months in order to maintain its water usage, since the melting of this snow in those same mountain regions leads to massive water runoff which itself adds to and becomes the country’s rivers. - [http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/](http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/) 

This means that, should those regions warm to a point where that snowfall is extremely hindered or halted all together (as is widely predicted), the country would be left with an unknowable loss in water supply for its population of millions. Add to this the prediction that overall rainfall throughout the country is expected to decrease simultaneously with this loss of the glacial melting cycle, and you begin to paint a painfully dire portrait. - [https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change](https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change)

More on Pakistan: - [https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/](https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/)

This combination of diminishing rainfall and glacial runoff isn’t unique to Pakistan. India, the world’s most populous nation, is expected to feel many of the same effects. Additionally, the major rivers leading into China and Southeast Asia are largely sourced from Tibet and the Himalayas, an area of incredibly high mountains and sprawling natural glaciers. The Mekong river, the Yangtze, and many others find their source in this central region of the Asian continent. Yet the fate of those rivers and their water sources are cast into doubt as climate change hammers away at Tibet and drains the region of this naturally recurring and utterly necessary cycle. - [https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html](https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html) 

So where does that leave us? Well, hopefully this shows the impending nature of the climate catastrophe. Climate Change is not some vague idea or one that has limited effects, it is both propelled by and propelling countless other changes within systems that are vital to both human and ecological survival. Failing to understand the grand nature of this problem, its immediacy, and it intersectional elements has allowed cognitive dissonance around the issue to flourish. In order to move forward with even the most basic amount of optimism, we must confront the reality of what is happening, rather than seeking to downplay it in order to attract wider attention to the issue.

This urgency should be the engine to gain that wider attention.

It is actually very worrying that so many people believe this. This Event, the coldest it ever been in many states is a result of climate change. We are seeing the effects happen. We only used to call it Global Warming because of that's what we thought with the science research we had before what was going on. The world is warming but that doesn't mean that snowstorms can't happen. It means it will happen more often. Extreme weather will happen more often. We need to do something about it or our kids. (Kids that are born in 2019!) Will not live to see 2100. It is time to stop making jokes about it. The evidence is all around us. Australia is flooding on one side and facing forest fires on the other. Changing to clean renewable energy is cheaper than ever before.  


We don't have 20 years, we don't have 10 years, we don't even have 5 years. We need to start demanding a change in how we get our energy now. We have only two choices, Keep making jokes about how something that is happening right in front of us is not happening, or we start demanding change at a local then state then federal level. This isn't about me, it isn't about you. It is about every single person on this planet. If we do nothing we will all die. Kids born today, won't be able to have kids or grandkids as we will be leaving an unfixable dying planet. We already lost 1/2 of every species in the world. We need to try and prevent any more. Please, this is not a scare tactic it is the truth. You do nothing and the world will end  


If you just read this and think I am overreacting, you are part of the problem. You are making the next generation be the last one humans ever have.

-Is suicide really the answer,or do you desperately want change?

-Is suicide REALLY the answer,or do you just want the bullshit to stop?

-Is dying by your own hand,REALLY the answer or are you just afraid/terrified of life? feel powerless? feel like a failure so you deem yourself unworthy to live?

-Is suicide really the answer? Will suicide solve **anything?**

Because,I can say I want to kill myself all day long,but Jesus..IDFK.

Because:The only thing that will happen when I stab myself/shoot myself is that i'll be dead...and that's it.

All the while I have NO idea if life will get THAT bad/apocalyptic that I need to kill myself before these world ""leaders"" decide to kill me/take away everything I care about/love(my family,however shitty they may be,included in that.)

And everything(INCLUDING my **deep** hatred/paranoia/obsession of North Korea included) could be narrowed down to 5 main reasons:

**1**-having to live with Trump-loving parents who watch FOX news ALL THE DAMNED TIME..and I have to listen to that shit because of the damned sound system my dad hooked up to the T.V in the living room...meaning that even with all doors closed,I gotta hear that shit.

Regardless if you love/like Trump and the GOP or not,you do NOT have to watch a news network like FOX news ALL the damn time..unless you want to be scared and angry...which,I'm sorry to say,my parents want to be.

And that shit is starting to infect me like a damned virus.

Shit.

**2**-Being fucked over by my own family...and practically having Florida forced upon me:In NYC,I was on track(for the most part) to either Join the Air Force via AFROTC..or at least graduate with my bachelor's degree and get a job in NY and head for Japan...but of course,the family who I was living with at the time practically kicked my ass out..for no real reason(it's not like I was doing drugs or bringing around dangerous folks into the house..I guess my sin was just being too quiet/wanting my own space.)

And then cue the now 5 years of misery in the shithole known as Florida.

I have never been more miserable somewhere in my entire life up until now.

And what's worse is that,while I DID get my B.A in political science,it's practically useless in Florida.

You have NO idea how many times I thought about either ripping up that damned diploma or burning it.

And what's worse than that is that I have NO IDEA when I *can* leave Florida.

**3**-Now onto my North Korea nonsense:This all began with,of course,North Korea's usual bullshit...and then the year where we..practically were THAT close to war with North Korea(2017),I had applied for JET(this-https://jetprogramusa.org/) and I had practically wanted to withdraw my application because of all that...but what happened was that I decided to press on..and then I got rejected anyway...

Come to think of it...It wasn't even North Korea that was THAT hard on me mentally..it was the fact that I got rejected from JET! Because now that I think about it,when I got rejected from JET,things went to utter shit for me mentally.

So Let me bring you the **PRIME** reason that I hate North Korea to the point where I think(rather thought) they should be exterminated once and for all-

**They would/could have taken away the VERY last thing that I had left,so to speak:
The VERY last dream I had from childhood:which was to go to Japan..via the Air Force(at the time,that is).**

You see,I had two very grand goals growing up:To Join the Air Force and go to Japan.

Obviously,the Air Force dream failed(crashed and burned -_-) but at least I still had Japan...

...And now you have people who say that North Korea,with their nukes,can destroy not only South Korea,but Japan with **very little issue** and with **no nation on the planet able to stop them..AT ALL.**

In other words,you have A TON of people thinking that the North Koreans..are these fuckers: 

https://independenceday.fandom.com/wiki/Harvesters

15 km wide city killing spaceships and all.

All according to the news media..and according to our government and many people on the internet(reddit and quora mostly.)

Like,I couldn't believe it:The last thing I REALLY cared about,the last thing I ever wanted from life...

...Now had this absurdly high chance of being taken away from me...and what's worse is that...I have a strong belief that Koreans do not like Black people at all.

Cruel admission:I liken Koreans to the KKK almost..and one sect of them has nukes...Shit.

Me and Koreans just do not mix.

I pretty much have good/ok relations/luck with people of any other race..but Koreans.

And they don't like black people at all...god help me.

Oh,and they hate Japanese people too..so I guess one might end up kicking my ass at some point because I like Japan...

So,yeah..this has been something that has been fucking up my life and mind quite a bit.

**5**-....Another thing on North Korea:During the early days of my paranoia,there were people who again,thought North Korea was actually THESE guys,city killing spaceships and all:

https://independenceday.fandom.com/wiki/Harvesters

And on R/credible defense..there was this guy(who I am 1000% sure is a fucking concern troll) who ESPECIALLY thought that North Korea were these unstoppable,EXTREMELY powerful,war god demons bred and born from Ares himself who could practically take over the goddamn world!

And my mind just hung on that shit and worse for a whole fucking year..and looks like it's gonna be a second year too(if the therapy/psychiatrists that I'm gonna see/talk too come up short like the last therapist girl I saw.)

And then there's the fact that apparently it's fucking wrong to like Japan/Japanese people/Japanese culture,lest you be called a ""weeaboo"" and shunned/insulted/trolled.

And I kinda understand something cruel:**Some people actually WANT Japan to be destroyed.** Yea...that's fucked up,to say the least.

And of course everytime I think about North Korea,I get so fucking infuriated.

The reason is simple,I guess:They threaten to take away,destroy the ONE thing that I care about the most,and I hate them for that.

I hate having shit taken away from me..especially my dreams/goals. 

And of course,such things led me to bullshit/half-true realizations like ""Life is hell,people are evil,etc.""

But,the truth..hell,the ultimate truth to all this shit is:

**It's not me,it's my fucking mind..my fucking brain.**

My mind is telling me that death is the answer.

My mind is telling me people are evil.

My mind is telling me that life is hell.

All of which are either half true..or complete bullshit.

And what i'm getting at,you ask?

Well,I just thought I'd really put this out there to:

-Illustrate the reason(s) for my North Korea Nonsense.

-To say..I don't really like life,but I don't wanna die either.

All this shit my head is feeding me..I'm gonna try and fight it.

I'm gonna move the fuck on,goddamnit!

But,I'm gonna be honest:This fight is gonna be a bitch.

And then there's the fact that I'll have a better chance of understanding the universe and alien life than Korea and Koreans/Korean culture.

I still fucking hate/fear North Korea...but I guess I can work on everything else about myself.

TL;DR:Some reasons why suicide is actually bullshit,your mind is the biggest fucking asshole you will EVER know and the reasons for my North Korea nonsense...I hope you at least get the gist to my madness,at least.","2019-02-23 01:58:32","2","2","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/atpw7l/afraid_to_diebut_hate_to_liveand_a_little/","True","Hayate_Immelmann_","1747923807.470434","our planet is dying","manual"
