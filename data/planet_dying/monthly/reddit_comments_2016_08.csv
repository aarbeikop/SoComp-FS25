Yes, it can seem grim, futile and hopeless at times but each little piece we manage to save and protect is one more piece not lost to us. There are 150-200 species lost every day but how many more would be lost without our efforts? How much worse would it be if we didn't try? We are addicted to meat but there are signs this is changing. 

In Britain, there has been a 350% increase in vegans over the last decade. https://munchies.vice.com/en_uk/articles/this-is-why-millennials-are-all-turning-vegan 

12% of millennials vegetarian compared to only 4% of generation Xers and 1% of baby boomers. http://www.mercyforanimals.org/were-winning-6-signs-that-veganism-is-taking

The information, science and publication of environmentalism is higher than its ever been before and access to it is even easier. Internet articles, social media, documentaries on all streaming services, even references throughout out pop culture. More and more people are being exposed to environmentalism and the ideals in which it holds. It may be a little late to save everything but the battle is not lost. I will fight to save every piece of nature I can because every piece saved is a piece not lost. The day we give up is the day we die.","2016-08-06 17:36:59","5","evomatrix","1747868882.761724","our planet is dying","manual"

She was the warmth of your cold and bitter past. She was what was worth living for in the days when there was no hope. And if I'm not too involved in this post with my self-disclosure here, I was in those days once in my life too when I was little. 


While I didn't have that particular person (maybe I did have those particular people in my heart that I had held up to), after years of self-training, I've learnt and tried to transform and transcend those loving voices, my warm memories, and the happy hours in my earlier stage of life, into my personal psychological assets, to support me  moving on, and heading to the challenges, especially when there's no love from the outside world for me.


You have to realize that, while the old memories are good, they are only the projections of what you crave inside, and that is love. She is still in your head, is because you want to feel loved, valued, that's your image and experiences on what love might look like to you. But they aren't real. At least not real enough for the current you, or what's more importantly, for her. You need to remember that she has her own thoughts and memories, and life. She is more than just a loving memory of yours. 


I wouldn't suggest or encourage you to forget or erase your good memories about her, because these are going to be your personal assets of self-love too: You are no longer that miserable person who you might still believe in, because you do remember that, you were once loved, and valued, and that's who you really are. Who you really are NOW.


So if she's willing to meet up with you, go and have fun. : ) But if she doesn't show up, you still have those great memories, and these will make you stronger, even without her. :)


You will have a blast on the concert, with her, or by yourself. Best wishes to you, OP. : )","2016-08-18 18:12:55","1","hikariing","1747869817.5399308","our planet is dying","manual"

"d6k6y16","t3_4y0o7d","4y0o7d","vegan","unknown","I think it's often a matter of feeling powerless, too. For instance: I'm concerned about climate change, but it doesn't stop me from driving a car or buying food that has been produced in factories and shipped over long distances to reach me. Why? Because those harms are so built into our system, it doesn't feel possible for even a large number of individuals to mitigate them.

Truthfully, problems like overfishing and climate change cannot - or at least, will not - be resolved by ethical consumerism alone. It's simply not tenable to expect average consumers, at the end of the food distribution chain, to change their behavior en masse enough to affect the workings of the system itself. Ethical issues inside the food system will change when we both reach a critical mass of consumer interest AND institute top-down changes through legislation and policy.

It's still quite hypocritical to criticize fishermen when you eat seafood, though - not sure I understand the logic there. It makes me think of the weird number of omnivores I've talked to who are anti-hunting.","2016-08-16 20:28:04","3","kaugar","1747869977.154688","our planet is dying","manual"

People dont always see their irrational behavior as we can see other peoples.  I think it's kind of like how a fish doesn't know its in water becuase its always been surrounded by it.  People are so use to their environment and behaviors, its hard to see the disconnects from some of their values.  

People dont always  think of things if there isnt something external to point to them in a direction, because they are so entrench in a particular way of being.  If you were to point out this hypocrisy to them, they might reconsider things.  

People get defensive and justify their irrational behavior when you call them out on hypocrisy, because their ego has been hurt.

"d6k7skl","t3_4y0o7d","4y0o7d","vegan","unknown","No one sees how we're part of the problem when we're part of the problem- that's one of the major reasons why many problems persist.  

It's not that many of us don't want to fix these things if we recognized all the ways in which they're damaging, we just aren't conditioned or educated in any significant way to be self-critical about them, to think of how, and analyze how, we ourselves are contributing to these problems or are repeating the same self-serving, broken thought patterns that other humans in the past have employed to rationalize their exploitation of others (which is really an issue, and something that should be taught in school or in cultural ways).  

> Studying conservation is all good and well, but how can they care about something so much they dedicate their life to it, and yet continue to contribute to the problem

Perhaps *especially* for those who claim some level of expertise in the specifically relevant areas (veterinary science, environmentalism, civil rights work, medicine, etc.), because it becomes even *more* bruising to the ego to have to admit that you were wrong (because it means you weren't just *casually* wrong like everyone around you, you were also wrong in some *professional* sense, possibly providing a false viewpoint or what has turned out to be wrong information to the public, etc., in a field you had devoted a significant portion of your life to).  

------

I think a second (smaller but slowly growing) part of the problem has become the hyper specialization of knowledge work (which will come to dominate all work as the world transitions from ""physical"" to ""intellectual"" labor) as the level of informational complexity increases in the world.  It is incredibly easy now to be so hyper-specialized in a field or a pursuit that you lack any context or meaningful interaction with ideas outside your chosen field of study (and the definition of ""field of study"" *itself* continues to narrow as the level of informational complexity increases in the world, causing people to only have the time to be able to reach and make relevant contributions to even narrower and narrower slices of any type of pursuit).  

The good news is that, in terms of ""home economics"", or the skills you develop to accomplish daily routines if you want to call it that, veganism is really simple.  If you can cook, you can learn to cook vegan without much modification of techniques, you just have to learn new recipes.  If you can read, you can learn to look for vegan ingredients on packaging.  

But if you were trying to learn to understand veganism in a very deeply intellectual way (if it didn't come naturally or obviously to you for whatever reason), it involves different topics, like politics, philosophy, biology, agriculture, etc., that have become very deep (just like environmental science has).  And the study of them enough to understand their intellectual motivation for becoming vegan can take immense amounts of time, too much for some people (who require higher burdens of proof) for them to produce effective changes in their lives in a quick time frame.  

-------

Finally, a third point (more specific to academics): intelligence is not the same thing as compassion.  Intelligence is also not the same thing as objectivity.  I'm sure your colleagues are very intelligent people, but highly intelligent people have pretty much just as good a history of buying into bad ideas as Joe Public does, if they were indoctrinated into them from birth, like almost all of us (besides those who grew up vegan) are with [Carnism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0VrZPBskpg) or Speciesism.  

It takes *different* skills to be highly objective about the world and your interaction with the world, than it takes to be highly quantitatively analytical (yes, those are actually different things).  Often, it takes the opposite of what academia requires- the generalization of intellectual pursuits, not the specialization, to have the contextual breadth to make good *global* (not local) choices.

"d6kilxo","t3_4y0o7d","4y0o7d","vegan","unknown","> So what I don't understand is, how can they all preach about how our planet is dying and something must be done, and yet don't take any actions to do this themselves?

Because they want *someone else* to fix the problem without them having to lift a finger... which is pretty much why there IS a problem in the first place.

Everyone wants someone else to fix it, while sitting back and waiting for someone else to do the hard work... yet of course, everyone else is doing the same... leading to a perfect circle of inactivity while everyone sits around griping that ""someone needs to DO SOMETHING"" about it.

> It just baffles me how even in a conservation and environment based (masters!) program the disconnect is still so rampant.

It shouldn't.  Even really smart people who profess to be really into something can have blinders on when it comes to things they'd prefer to ignore.","2016-08-17 01:02:20","2","anachronic","1747869977.170785","our planet is dying","manual"
