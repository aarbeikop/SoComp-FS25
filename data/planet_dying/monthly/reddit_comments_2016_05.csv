The absolute TRAGEDY of the current situation is that, in humanity's bellicose, selfish stupidity, it is destroying the opportunities of countless other species to exist. THAT is on us. We are guilty, and in a just world, we would be punished--with death. Ironically, that is precisely what will happen. But there is no justice in humanity's demise for the perfidy of ecocide: humanity's end is the end state of all species, regardless of moral judgment. Talk/ideas such as yours smack of the criminal trying to escape his punishment, but it won't matter in the end, anyway, so why do it?

The ""saving humanity"" shtick is part of our problem, as it implies--AGAIN--that Man is separate from Nature, that the end state of 4 billion years is Man, and Man is all-important and MUST overcome and triumph into the stars. It's a self-aggrandizing, self-important and childish fantasy, and only contributes to the speed at which things are being simplified. 

Focus instead on being the most loving, honest, cogent person you can be. You can't save humanity, even if you really wanted to, but you can be a net positive while you're here.","2016-05-06 17:45:19","17","deskpoet","1747863673.477068","our planet is dying","manual"

Unfortunately, your concerns are completely justified, and research is quickly accumulating to support your grim prognosis. I just finished the third volume of Ward's trilogy on the subject, *Our Flooded Earth: Our Future in a World Without Ice Caps*, and his estimate is that the full Canfield Ocean will take two or more millennia to appear. The Bad News is the process may already be unstoppable. More Bad News is that the book was written in 2010, and recent research suggests his had underestimated most of the trend lines.

James Lovelock concurs with your lifeboat concept in his final(?) book, *Rough Ride to the Future*. He suggests modeling the survival communities on the mounds of desert termites. 

What you are proposing is not idle science fiction but sober assessment of the human future - such as it is.

"d2vmnhe","t3_4i5mi1","4i5mi1","collapse","skeptical","If your goal is just to have a much smaller population of humans survive and continue the species, you don't need lifeboats.  At least not this century, but possibly in subsequent ones.  Unless, I'm misreading it this post seems to suggest that the world will be uninhabitable in the  relatively near future.  I don't really want to get in yet another argument of Guy MacPherson vs the scientific community, but let's at least admit that you have to kind of go out on a limb to believe we're going to need self contained biodomes or something to survive any time soon.

It's very possible that they could be a necessity for human survival centuries from now, when we could start seeing things like plankton and vegetation that produce our  breathable air totally collapse.  At that point though, I think it's highly doubtful that society will have the technological and industrial capability to build something like you're describing.  

So in that sense, you might be right.  Build them now when we (possibly) can, and hope they last until we really need them.  But that just isn't how the world works.  Nobody is going to take on what would probably be the most ambitious and expensive engineering project in history in order to provide for people several generations from now.  Nobody *really* cares about ""continuing the human species"" and why should they?  We care about continuing our own lives and those of our loved ones.

No doubt things are going poorly, but the reason most don't try is that people want to enjoy the good times as long as possible. No one wants to bail on modern society while there may still be a decade or two left.  

Honestly though, if we can't muster the collective will to stand up as a species and take action to prevent another Permian Triassic extinction event (even if the action is futile) then I'm not sure I would really advocate for the survival of our species.
