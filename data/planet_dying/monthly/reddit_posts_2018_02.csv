"7wtd40","vegan","unknown","The carnist mind, or the unnatural cause of man’s demise.","The mindset that still makes us perceive our animal friends as object of enslavement for the unnecessary purpose of satisfying our basic desires is outdated and not aligned with the new state of reality that is now available for us to perceive and live through, as a fresh new mindset stemming from the knowledge of our times (unnecessary because there is a plethora of food alternatives available to us today, which are not only healthier for ourselves, but are also free of any sufferings impaired upon another sentient being, such as veganism). Those who have evolved past the need to eat animal flesh for sustenance, will have evolved into their proper place within the nature of earth, as opposed to our perceived place within the nature of man. 

The ""nature of man"" is defined by man's perspective of the world, whereas the ""nature of earth"" defines the place of man in the world. The place of man in the world is not to eat animal flesh, for that is to follow the ""nature of man"" rather than the ""nature of earth"", as the ""nature of man"" follows man's desires rather than man's true needs in the world. Within the ""nature of earth"", man's place is to live in harmony with all living beings on planet earth, for man's abilities are to be used in service of the living rather than in servitude of the living, as is currently the case within the majority of the world. 

The state of our current reality is such that an alternative to eating animal flesh, is available to us all and goes by the name of veganism - one only has to adopt a vegan lifestyle in order to bring about a revolution within one’s mindset, and by virtue of one’s actions, within the world at large. To value the living as food or objects of commodity, is to devalue the meaning of life, for it removes all value from where it is due, which is in the living, and places it into where it isn't due, which is in the dying. There shouldn't be any value placed into the dying of beings, such as the value that we place on the commodification of animal beings, for such an act is and will forever be void of nourrishment within the world, for the animal beings are thus not able to participate within the world anylonger, thus not being able to continue feeding the world of their unique expressions. Such an act is a detriment to life and the living, for it states that we value the dying before we value the living - which is the heart of the illness within our minds -, for it places our awareness within void vacuums which cannot respond to our expressions, such as the objects of commodity and food that we have turned the living beings into, rather than placing our awareness within full expressions which can respond, such as through the living animal beings that have come to share life on earth with ourselves. 

It is only when we will perceive the living as being more valuable than the dying, that we will rekindle our connection to the heart of all living beings, thus restablishing the proper relationship that exists between the heart and the mind within ourselves. Within that relationship, we are constantly fed by the values of the heart through thoughts and intentions which are aligned with the purposes of our souls. The purposes of our hearts is to end all unecessary sufferings to all the living beings involved within the reach of our actions. All unnecessary sufferings should be banished from the habits of our beings, for all unnecessary sufferings are banished by the direction of our evolution. 

The direction of our evolution is the state of being where we are totally at peace with the knowledge that we have of the world and by extension, existence. It is the state of being where we are totally at peace with the knowledge we hold of the world, for we know within that knowledge, that all living life forms are free to express their uniqueness within a world that welcomes their expressions rather than enslaving them for profit. To reach the being that we are evolving into, we have to stop behaving in ways which are a detriment to LIFE through the eating and abuse of the LIVING, and start behaving in ways which are a glorification of LIFE through the loving and caring of the LIVING. 

Through becoming vegan, one accomplishes that destiny and evolves back into the core of one's heart, for it is that core which values the LIVING before valuing the dying - as only that which is in the mind can value the dying before the living, as through the mind, the dying is it's ultimate destiny, or it's ultimate point of becoming, while through the heart, the living is the being's ultimate destiny, or it's ultimate point of becoming. To have the proper perspective on things, which is the perspective of our hearts, we have to perceive ourselves as beings which will forever become the living, meaning that the world we leave after our passages here on earth, will be destined to beings which will become the living of the future, as our future beings. We, as the beings which are becoming the living - as forever perceived through the heart - rather than becoming the dying - as forever perceived through the mind -, have a duty to create the best future possible for the living to express itself within the world to come. For it is what we are becoming that will experience this world. It is when we perceive existence through the lense of our hearts that we perceive ourselves as forever becoming the living, as through the perception of our hearts, rather than forever becoming the dying, as through the perception of our minds. 

The heart perceives that we are forever in the process of becoming that which is living - or that we are evolving towards life -, rather than the perception of the mind of being forever in the process of becoming that which is dying - or that we are evolving towards death. When one values life and the living above all else, as the living should always be valued, one stops eating and wearing all of the products which comes from the death of the living, for such products devalue life and the living to the size of the commodities the living has become. The value of life and the living can never be reduced to a commodity, for the commodity will always be void of what gives life it's value - the living being the only creator of value, is the most important aspect of existence for without the living, existence would have no value whatsoever. 

It is therefore imperative that we glorify the living through the ending of the activities that we partake in which involves the direct or indirect abuse and killing of living sentient beings, for it is only when we will stop participating in those activities that we will start participating in the activities which will bring about the world that we are evolving into. That world will not come by itself however, as we will all have to change from within ourselves in order to make it a reality. Through becoming vegan, one will accomplish one's primary purpose in life, which is to reunite oneself with the essence as the source of the living within our hearts, so as to change our ways in order to correct the errors of the past, and to bring about a world that will be the best for all living beings.



Question :
How much life do you destroy when you wash your hands? Is it number of lives that matters, or quality? Suffering IS life. You claims man's role in the earth is something more important than the animals role in man's desires. How do you know the desires of earth? Also wouldn't you then say that the earth desires are leas important that the solar systems? Or galaxy's? Universe? If so then why such emphasis on what the earth wants. That'd like worrying about what a man wants, no?
Answer:

The emphasis that is placed on the desires of the earth in regards to the role that man plays in the ecosystem, is made so in order to highlight the fact that man would return to grace if he only but accepted to limit himself to the natural food source that was designed for him to properly digest by nature. The fact is that the body of man is not naturally designed to properly digest meats or animal products, as the digestive system of man is more in tune with the digestive system of a frugivore or herbivore rather than that of an omnivore or predator (the lenght of man's intestines, for example, conserves the same ratio of lenght that exist between the lenght of the torso and the lenght of the intestines of herbivores or frugivores, and not the same as that of a predator or omnivore.). This is seen through the fact that most major illnesses are caused by the consequences of eating meats and animal products, as the illnesses are nature's way to inform us of the mistakes we make in regards to what we put into our body, as most major illnesses comes from the direct consequences of what we ingest.
If man were to consume the foods that man is designed to digest by nature, as the digestive system of man is more akin to a frugivore/herbivore rather than being akin to a predator/omnivore, man would eventually get rid of the health problems that plagued his existence ever since he started eating meats and animal products. Through this, man's foods would be perfectly suited for his digestive system, therefore greatly reducing the chances, if not completely removing them, of having illnesses and diseases occur within his physical body.

It is because man desires being that which man isn't, which is that he desires being a predator or an omnivore rather than the herbivore or frugivore that he is designed by nature as being, that man seeks to consume the animal flesh that a predator or omnivore would consume, rather than seeking to comsume what an herbivore or frugivore would consume. It is because of this mistake in man's perception of his true nature, that man has fallen prey to patterns of being which promotes a character which is not native to himself, as per the design of nature, which in turn transforms man's behaviour into what he wasn't designed to express. Through this, man has held the conterfeit nature that he mistakenly believes to be his own, for the ""nature of man"" mimicks the behaviours of those beings who he associates with within nature - the predators and omnivores. It is because of the mistake made in his fundamental identity that man has delved into behaviours which are not aligned with his true role in nature, or man's true role in the earth, as man is not a predator or an omnivore as per the design of his digestive system, but rather a frugivore or an herbivore.

As long as man will continue behaving in ways which follows the behaviours of predators or omnivores rather than behaving in ways which follows the behaviours of frugivores or herbivores, man will continue affecting the ecosystem and himself, by disturbing the equilibrium within himself and between all living life forms on earth. It is because man consumes what he is not designed to consume by nature, and at alarming rates, that man has created the disequilibrium within the ecosystem that he is a part of.

It is only when man will accept his proper place within the world as a frugivore or herbivore, and consequently consume the products that are limited to this way of being, that the ecosystem will eventually return to a state of equilibrium within the world. Therefore, if man would strictly follow the role that earth has designed for him to follow, the most important problems of the world would naturally find resolve, as man would have thus returned to his proper place within nature, thereby allowing equity to be expressed for all living beings in the world.

To the question concerning the importance of the earth's desires in relation to the importance that greater entities such as the solar systems, galaxies or universe has within the greater scheme of things, earth's priorities are of greater importance for they are the only priorities that has any relevance to the quality of our existences. It is thus only when earth's priorities will be fulfilled through our actions within her, that the desires of the greater entities such as the solar systems, galaxies or universe, will be fulfilled.

The desires of the solar systems, galaxies or universe, can only be fulfilled from the perception of our vantage point within existence, if we fulfill the desires of earth first and foremost, for without answering the needs of our planet before answering the needs of those greater entities, there wouldn't be a single man to witness those greater entities and their needs. The fact that earth is the closest entity to ourselves in relation to the other greater entities that you have mentionned within your comparison, shows that earth and her interests should be our main focus of concern, for without life being possible in our planet, the fate of the other entities would become entirely irrelevant for there wouldn't be any one of us to bare witness of anything, let alone the entities you have mentionned.

Obviously, earth's desires are more important than those of the other entities you have mentionned, for earth's interests supersedes them all, being that earth is the most fundamental prerequisite of our physical existences and as such, is the only basis upon which we owe the experience of our existences. Simply put, without earth there would't be anyone to muse upon the meaning of it all, therefore, it is imperative that we correct the destructive, unnatural behaviours of mankind, or ""mind"" ""kind"", towards the earth and the living in it, into the constructive and natural behaviours of our hearts, or ""heart"" ""kind"", towards the earth and the living in it, which alone holds promise of our salvation.

"7upo2t","conspiracy","unknown","Gnosticism and the Demiurge is the Truth amidst a realm ridden with Deception","According to Gnostic literature, it reveals the true nature of this reality to be illusory and that the material universe is corruptible. While contemporary Abrahamic religions contend that an allegedly benevolent God shapes this world and the Devil/Satan wreaks havoc in defiance of this 'Lord', such dichotomy may be inaccurate according to Gnosis. The being responsible for the creation of this world is not an infallible or perfect figure, in fact the terms ""God"" and ""Devil"" are perhaps speaking of the same entity known as the Demiurge. If you examine biblical literature, there are many passages that demonstrate the viciousness and outright hostility of YHWH, the being that people today refer to as 'God'. The Demiurge, whose secret name is Yaltabaoth, or child of Chaos, and its entourage of Archons are deemed responsible for the captivity of our souls in this illusory, material matrix realm of pain and suffering. The Demiurge's behavior demonstrates that it is devoid of compassion and empathy, and even possess bloodlust. Observe your world, this realm is steeped in Chaos. Has your experience here proven that this is the divine working of a perfect creator? Instead, has this realm brought you adversity, agony, suffering? Does your happiness come at the expense of other sentient beings? Have you endured cruel and unfathomable pain that you would not wish upon the most despicable of people? Inconceivably heinous and abominable things happen here, and for what good reason?

The beast system where animals mercilessly attack and kill other beings as a means of survival. People dying in agonizing ways by diseases, natural disasters, famine and gruesome murders among many others. From my own experience all that I've ever known was immense suffering dealing with several different diseases and watching innocent children die a brutal, agonizing and slow death to cancer. What kind of benevolent God would allow such atrocities to persist? People find it exciting when pondering the notion of reincarnation into perhaps a fearless lion or bear. But what if you draw the short end of the stick and reincarnated as an innocent baby impala or gazelle over in the eastern parts of the world? What you find over in r/natureismetal and online videos is the beast system in its raw form where these souls are eaten alive In such immense agony by other beings in this realm. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcnH\_TOqi3Ibaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3Ibaby) (baby impala being eaten alive by baboons) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc63Rp\-UN10baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc63Rp-UN10baby) (baby elephant being eaten alive by lions) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90M7kH5wCtA#t=04m15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90M7kH5wCtA#t=04m15s) (koala eaten from a tree by a puma)

An evil, wrathful, vengeful entity that constantly demands worship is what I interpret the Demiurge and the Buddhist teachings which closely ties with Gnosticism greatly resonates with me. To liberate our souls out of this archontic karma reincarnation system and break the cycle of suffering. Freedom from the Samsara Wheel.

[http://college.holycross.edu/projects/himalayan\_cultures/2011\_plans/dsexton/Wheel\_of\_Samsara.html](http://college.holycross.edu/projects/himalayan_cultures/2011_plans/dsexton/Wheel_of_Samsara.html) (an ancient Buddhist painting depicting the Demiurge grasping the wheel of the various different hellish/heavenly astral realms we find our souls in. The bottom pictures show beastly entities, demonic in nature who are tormenting many human souls in depths of fire (hell). The being to the right floating above the cloud is a Buddhist monk who was able to attain complete Liberation from this evil Samsara Wheel)

Take a moment to truly analyze what is occuring within the pictures here [https://imgur.com/a/Mr9zV](https://imgur.com/a/Mr9zV) Notice that their is a very distinct common theme from various parts of the world in their interpretation of the Hellish astral realms our souls/consciousness can reside in. They were certainly more tuned into the spiritual aspect of human existence compared to the matrix spell we are under today. The beastly demonic entities that are depicted within these ancient paintings from all over the world are the agents & minions of the Demiurge/Archons. Archons are hidden negative controllers of humankind, inorganic interdimensional entities that must now be exposed and exorcised from the individual human mind, from our human species, and from the planet as a whole as part of our collective evolution to a new state of consciousness and being. Archons are a parasite that has ruled over and controlled earth for centuries. We have been spiritually enslaved exactly as it is depicted in The Matrix. Pure evil, it is up to us to put in the work and effort in achieving liberation out of this for the sake of the collective soul. The intro of the film the Animatrix sums it up rather perfectly. The robots are essentially the Archons responsible for tormenting our souls [https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=304s&v=jNiO2sTe2wo#t=05m10s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=304s&v=jNiO2sTe2wo#t=05m10s)

The reason you hear people or David Icke refer to ""ruling family bloodlines"" is because humanity is controlled by 13 bloodlines. These bloodlines hold the genetic DNA blueprint required for these archons to survive on. Devoid of empathy, love, positivity, these beings are the literal reincarnational opposite of what human beings truly are. Our reality has been hijacked, our emotions manipulated, our culture destroyed, divided, attacked. We are not a hateful species. We do not truly resonate at a level of negativity, anger, fear, hatred, but by control through financial institutions, pharmaceutical companies, military, entertainment, food, media, everything. We have been controlled and put into a state of constant fear, worry, anxiety, the exact opposite of what we are as humans. The archons feed off negativity and the fear vibrations of human beings that are constantly induced in those states because of the lifestyle that has been constructed for us to control us as modern day slaves. Although archons do exist physically, the real danger they pose to humanity is not invasion of the planet but invasion of the mind. The archons are intrapsychic mind\-parasites who access human consciousness through telepathy and simulation. They infect our imagination and use the power of make\-believe for deception and confusion. I hope I am tying this together well enough. With 13 ruling bloodlines, with the genetic DNA blueprint required for these entities to continue living through us contained in those 13 bloodlines. By control of all major institutions required to live on this earth we are basically forced into their system of control. By being subjugated to that voluntary control that appears as reality but is really controlling us they manage to keep humanity in a low state of vibrational being. This has been done for eons. Everything dark in the world is related to this archons. Pedophile networks are tied to these negative beings that use the fear, depravity, and lack of light as a means to sustain itself. Archons have become so disconnected from light, so disconnected from God source, they require the exact opposite of what God source is to survive because it is the polar opposite of what the creator is.

The inverted pentagram is the primary sigil associated with Satanism, the dark occult, dark arts, left\-hand path.

The explanation for this is because it represents a perversion, or an inversion of the sacred seal of the upright pentagram.

The upright standing pentagram has five points. The bottom four points of the star symbolize the elements that comprise matter: Earth, Fire, Air, Water. The apex of the pentagram symbolizes Spirit, and it's governance over the forces and elements of Matter.

The Hermetic definition of Spirit is a higher or mystic force or power. Spirit is also the Numinous Presence or Power contained within the divinity of Man. This is the force that counters and repels the demonic forces of iniquity peddled by the Archons. Without cultivating the Heart and pursuing Spirit, we are but wounded prey no more intelligent than the animals here in Kenoma (realm of matter) to these Astral Predators.

When the Pentagram becomes inverted, it subjugates the Spirit and permits the forces of corruptible matter to reign over the Numinous. This is the ultimate maneuver of subjugating the souls incarcerated in this realm. It is a formidable force that dominates this world. Observe your world, and know that the majority of Souls are motivated by the pursuit of worldly things \-\- gratification, wealth, power, sensual pleasure, etc. There is a profound lack of True education on matters of the Soul and matters of Spirit.

If anyone has an interest in a variety of material considered 'gnostic' by virtue of the systems utilized to unveil that which is hidden, I recommend The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P. Hall as primer into the genre of classical esoterics.

For more literature based on classical authentic Gnosis I recommend delving into the texts contained in the Nag Hammadi series. It is in my opinion the premier library of texts that present the unadulterated Gnostic revelation \-\- an apocalyptic vision of the story of our genesis. It portrays a uniquely different interpretation of the contemporary Christian mythos, that is: the story of Creation and the Garden of Eden, was the Fall of Man as clear cut as we are taught?

Read the Apocraphyn of John, the Gospel of Thomas, Hypostasis of the Archons. These are but a few contained within the incredible library found in Nag Hammadi, but I recommend The Dead Sea Scrolls and research the Cathars, the Valentinians, Sethians, Manichaeism, etc.

The Cathars were a legitimate Gnostic sect of Christianity that shared many tenets of Buddhism and Dharma. They were an exceptionally peaceful group of ascetics that abstained from meat consumption and taught the revelation of the transmigration (reincarnation) of souls as orchestrated by the Archons/Lords of Karma. They were annihilated by the Archon/Demon infiltrated Catholic church in one of the most egregiously heinous murder campaigns ever waged, sanctioned by Pope Innocent III.

Gnosis is about redemption and liberation from the clutches of the Beast system. Truth is the conduit to this freedom.
