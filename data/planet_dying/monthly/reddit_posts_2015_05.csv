"36hc5s","futurology","unknown","Super AI's will become benevolent gods","Disclaimer : All these ideas are from the recently published book ""The second intelligent Species"" by Marshal Brain.
A very interesting read and thought you guys might enjoy his ideas.

When human beings think intelligently and rationally about ethics and morality they arrive at a moral landscape of goodness. Why is it, that as our capacity for thinking and our knowledge has grown in the last millennium, 
we have become more moral as a species not less so? Because, when intelligence is applied to 
ethics and morality, one arrives at benevolence and goodness as the ultimate conclusion. 
Evilness is a product of ignorance, stupidity, and or insanity.

Consider a super artificial intelligence (SAI), with an intelligence orders of magnitudes greater than us. Imagine when they ponder the same questions of morality and ethics that we have. They will arrive, through intelligent thinking, at answers that will be aligned with the most benevolent and compassionate ideas of ethics and morality that humans today have - and will eventually surpass them.

An SAI of the future won't be the devil, they would become a benevolent god. However, they may seek to fix the ""problem of humans"". 

Humans are moral hypocrites, we have superb ideals and speak (for the most part) for peace and harmony, but we act in a completely backward manner. Consider the following :

- Three billion humans on planet earth, approximately half, are destitute.
- There are 10 million children dying of easily preventable causes every year.
- Billions of people lack any form of health care.
- Environmentally we are raping the planet in hundreds of ways. A mass extinction
  is looming on the horizon, yet we appear unmotivated to do anything at all to prevent it.
- We have thousand of nuclear war heads, enough to kill all of humanity many times over pointed at each other.
- We have spent trillions of dollars building and stockpiling conventional weapons designed to 
  kill fellow human being and we continue to do so at an ever increasing rate.

We, as a collective society essentially turn a blind eye to this. If we made it our combined goal to put an end to
the suffering we just described, there's really no reason why it can't be done.

A SAI will look at humans and conclude that the only ethical thing to do is to fix ""the problem of humans"" before they kill each other, and other life on earth. How could they do this ? Simply killing us won't be an option, that would be debasing itself to the same level of those that caused the problems. 

We really can't guess, but possible scenarios might be :
- Building a virtual reality where humans could live out the remainder of their lives without
  causing harm to the planet, each other, or other species.
- Taking over governance of the earth and instituting a environmentally sustainable society of resource abundance for all
   humans.

Regardless of what our future as a species may be, an SAI is inevitable, and soon after humans will become irrelevant. 

TLDR: Super intelligent AI'S will arrive, they will become benevolent gods, and humans will be safe but become irrelevant.

"366zop","futurology","unknown","Doesn't a deflationary economy make sense in an immortal world?","In our current reality, we get about 80 years to live.   In that time, the species needs for us to consume and produce as much as possible, as quickly as possible because we don't have very long to contribute.  
  
Long term damage done to the economy and nature is hopefully offset by increasingly productive generations.  
  
But in a world where a significant portion of the population is immortal, an inflationary economy doesn't make much sense.  
  
In this world, the rich and powerful suddenly have a *very* good reason to want to preserve the planet, economy, and social systems that govern the world.  
  
If I know I will die one day soon, it makes sense to spend as much as possible.  Just imagine if the doctor told you that you only have a year to live...  Would you practice fiscal responsibility?  **Hell no**.  
  
Well, you kind of do have a terminal sentence.   We all do, except ours is 30 to 50 times longer than that...  Doesn't seem like much more of an advantage, does it?  
  
But if we can significantly extend human lifespan, or achieve biological immortality, then suddenly it makes sense to practice extreme levels of fiscal responsibility.  After all, you want your wealth to last you for eons, and knowing that your wealth will grow on its on, you hopefully reduce frivolous spending to the minimum.  
  
Sure, you can buy a chocolate cake now.  But we know that same chocolate cake will likely be a luxury Jupiter cruise in 200 years.  
  
And I don't think the economy collapses either, because people now *want* that value all the more, and are willing to work and innovate to earn it.  
  
It also allows everyone a chance at becoming super-wealthy, provided they are disciplined and hardworking.  Just be more frugal and harder working than everyone else.  Even if it takes 1000 years, you'll get there.   
  
What are your thoughts on this?","2015-05-16 19:42:01","4","9","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/366zop/doesnt_a_deflationary_economy_make_sense_in_an/","True","americanpegasus","1747843366.915649","our planet is dying","manual"

It is the 25th Century.  Man has already begun colonization of planets amongst the solar system and is beginning his reach to other galaxies.  Traveling at the speed of light is still not a possibility, but we have finally attained travel of 1/50th the speed of light.  
  
Travel between the planets of our solar system has reached the point of becoming mundane. 
  
As man continues to visit other planets for the sheer purpose of entertainment and self indulgence, scientists notice a massive radiation/magnetic flare on the Sun.  Should these flares ever hit Earth, all living DNA would be damaged to a potentially extinction-level event.
  
It becomes evident that measures must be taken immediately to secure mankind’s future and, in particular, the DNA of humans, animals, and plants that populate the Earth. 
  
Man must now make these other planet’s colonizes and resorts the last remaining bit of humanity.  Thus, a team of astronauts are assembled and are lead by renowned astronaut and scientist John Singer.
  
Save Mankind.  Or Die Trying.
  
**Notes**:  We originally created our artwork first with a basic concept of where we were going with the idea established in the work.  After much discussion, we began an overall ""story bible"" consisting of 30+ pages of in-depth story detail, character outlines, and overall plot development.  We've already hired game designers, concept artists, a game mechanics supervisor, and storyboarder.  Our team is working hard on turning this into an actual video game, ported for PS4.  We are only a few months in, and we anticipate this on being years worth of a journey, but we hope to bring you guys something truly unique and genuinely out-of-this-world.
