It's like two combined independent projections. On one side we plan to have +50% population, on the other side -50% yield. That cannot work. The population won't rise as much if there is no food to sustain it.","2019-10-25 13:21:07","27","Koala_eiO","1747937000.90021","our planet is dying","manual"

"f55i28n","t3_dmsjz3","dmsjz3","collapse","skeptical","> For cereal crops, every 1 degree of warming leads to a 10% decrease in yields

Old and very basic estimate. Reality is non-linear, and is very likely to be much greater impact than 10% loss for every 1 degree after +2C to pre-industrial levels due to great number of indirect effects piling up and together smashing modern agricultural activities dead. For example, collapse of all kinds of eco-systems, especially important - in-soil eco-systems and biota.

> if we experience a 5 degree warming by 2100 we may have 50% less grain to feed a 50% larger global population

5 degree warming will mean much greater loss than 50% of grain production, in itself. Other consequences, few of which i mentioned just above, as well as other non-climate major damage to the agricultural endeavors, which is already taking place on global scale and many of which will inevitably yet massively worsen by 2100 - will further reduce the figure. Such as, for example, ongoing loss of genetic diversity of industrially-grown crops, which leads to bigger and bigger losses from bigger, more frequent and ever harder to get rid of pest outburts, exactly because evolution of pests gives more efficient (for pests) results vs poorer genetic variety of crops. Said loss of genetic diversity - is going on because ultimately, it is cheaper ""here and now"" for agriculturalists to work with a ""single variety"" rather than with a few different ones. And thus, again and again, they simplify their crops - which in the long run ruins their own business. But hey, ""who cares what will be by 2100, we need cash NOW"", eh.

> At just 2 degrees of warming, the Mediterranean and much of India will experience frequent droughts, straining global food supply.

Correct, but incomplete. In addition to said areas, also large parts of US, China, Brazil and other SA countries, Australia, central Europe are all going to experience that as well, if my memory about PDSI maps created by Aiguo Dai et al for +2C case is correct. Further warming will turn many of those regions into actual deserts, of course. Yet in the same time, a number of other areas in the world will experience huge increases in precipitation, of which two largest areas, iirc, are much of Canada and russian Far East. The latter already experience floods which destroy thousands homes and kill at least hundreds people, i heard.

Overall, in a hotter world, more precipitation takes place, because more evaporation due to higher temperatures. However rainfalls are on average heavier and less sustained, and air currents' change results in much different pattern of precipitation deistributon around the globe - while biosphere is not yet adapted to that new pattern. Thus regarding precipitation, ""too much"" and ""too little"" of it - will become new norm for much, if not for the most, of the globe.

> These rises would force hundreds of millions of people out of their homes as coastal cities all over the world are submerged.

Don't over-estimate this particular effect, however. I have no doubt that new ways to cope with that water rise will be found as the problem gradually becomes a major one. It is likely that majority of those forced to leave their homes - won't go any far, remaining in their region, merely finding ways to get them a new home in the area. Often, it'd be floating home, examples of which are relatively widespread already. It's often insanitary and comes with whole set of its own troubles, but we know it's what likely to happen, nonetheless. As many of those people won't have any better choice.

> we will have to invent new categories to describe hurricanes

A bit more precision, please? Category 6 will be quite enough, i read; thus just one new category, not more. Not that cat 6 ones are not deadly, of course - they will be unimaginably deadly; but just to be precise, you know, best to stick to the official terms.

> By 2090 2 billion people will be breathing air classed as unsafe.

Well, i'd be very surprused if that would actually happen. Instead, i expect the air by 2090 would be times cleaner than it is now, and also i expect number of people by then being much, much lower than 2 billion - total Earth human population, i mean. With Global industrial complex, as a whole, being non-functional for a few decades by then, the air will naturally clean as almost all kinds of tropospheric air pollutants - are washed down by precipitation and gravity in a matter of several weeks to at longest few years, depending on region.

> This resulted in a 100% fatality rate, 120,000 dead Saigas, and the Saiga becoming extinct in some countries. Its entirely possible that humans may experience a similar thing.

Not possible, in practice. Unlike deers and animals in general, humans are able to prevent succumbing to this kind of extinction. When you last heard of any kind of deers _themselves_ proceeding with any kind of quarantine, sanitation, sterilization methods, etc? Yet all those and such - are totally doable even post-collapse, with very little knowledge about it and very little matherials available. In other words, like it or not, but humans are unlikely to be wiped out by any sort of bacterial mutations. Those mutations, if/when occured, will be contained and will not affect the majority of human population. 

Now viruses are a bit different story, though. Especially man-made viruses. But that's whole different story... Which i hope will never unfold.","2019-10-25 12:51:05","7","Fins_FinsT","1747937000.9095218","our planet is dying","manual"

Magnetic pole reversal, though we have no idea what this will really do with our dependence on electricity in the modern age. There is a general belief the magnetic pole reversal will be slooooow and steady and have almost no noticeable effect on daily life. There is another idea that flip-flopping the Earth's magnetic field has more impact on Earth than we could possibly understand with our current level of science and evidence on the matter. Either way, a reversal means a weakening. See the next item.

Magnetic field (shield) weakening due to movement of the poles allowing for increases in solar particulate and radioactive matter entering the Earth's atmosphere and environment. This will irradiate massive areas of the planet. If the shield weakens enough that a sufficient solar wind gust could allow the solar wind (outer space) to touch the surface of the planet, instantly killing and sterilizing whatever it touches. Except for tardigrades. Those little cuteys survive.

You say they’re holographs. Holographs don’t give off radar returns and they don’t leave traces on the ground. The physical evidence for UFOs is ample if you have even a basic knowledge of the history of reports. Plus there’s an inconsistency. One one hand, you say the secret pedo master group’s technology is up to 10,000 years ahead of the rest of us. If they’re so advanced, isn’t it a bit lucky that they’re using technology like holograms that you can easily understand? 

Your treatment of the origins of UFO reports is similarly wrongheaded. It’s well known that UFOs predate the 50s. I mean first of all the flying saucer craze began in the summer of 1947 and an Air Force pilot died chasing one in early 1948. But that’s close enough that we can say it’s basically the 50s I suppose. Before that there were foo fighters and ghost rockets. Before that there were mystery airships, and before that we have flying shields and swords instead of flying “discs” or “cigars” or now “tic tacs” that use contemporary imagery to describe the reports. What began in the late 40s and early 50s was an official Air Force investigation. Not the phenomenon itself. 

Plus you say that the reason there are pedo controlled holographic UFO imposters being projected around is fear. But in reality, are people actually afraid of UFOs? There was the Orson Welles war of the worlds radio broadcast in the 30s sure. But I’ve read a whole book on that, and it’s conclusion was that the “mass hysteria” was grossly overblown. To offer a personal opinion, I’d say the idea that aliens in UFOs are benevolent is a lot more pervasive. Just go over to /r/UFOs and try to find posts about fear there. It’s not the norm. According to Gallup polls, about a third of Americans believe that some UFOs are aliens. If the core reaction was fear, surely the collective fear of so many people would be more readily visible? Though to be fair I’ve never seen polls about what Americans think *about* the UFOs to show they aren’t afraid either.

What you say about UFOs doesn’t fit the history of reports.","2019-10-19 16:12:15","10","reddittimenow","1747937946.469665","our planet is dying","manual"

It is the responsibility of each man to pay attention to his surroundings, to assess the situation, to determine what is true.  He instead wastes his brainpower on fantasy movies, TV shows and spectator sports and lives his life trained as a passive observer, meekly accepting outrage all around him.  By doing so he is legitimizing it.  He is putting his stamp of approval on all of it.  If the savior beamed down from the sky right now, this very minute, he would be doing a great disservice to humanity by aiding it.  If he used the power of God to destroy all of the ""evil"" elites, another such group would instantly converge to feed on the same wound, doing just as the last batch had done.  The real savior will be an angel of death, setting fire to the whole rotting carcass.  The people want to deflect the responsibility onto this politician or that system but it is 100% the people's fault for falling for each and every trick in the book, line by line and over and over again.  The people are 100% responsible.   Nobody likes to hear this but it's true.  Along with the general ignorance and intelligence deficit comes the general lack of values and consideration for others.","2019-10-19 17:31:16","1","Joroda","1747937946.487722","our planet is dying","manual"

The UFO/UAP would then be chased away by Fighter Jets. The Presidents and Pentagon tired of these interference/shenanigans challenged the Military-Industrial Complex to put an end to this. Hence Blockchain was born, this is the reason Cracking Blockchain is the biggest threat to National Security because whoever can crack Blockchain can highjack the Nukes/NC3

I like this one.

 Although the alternative explanations are either inside jobs sabotaging the nukes, or simply that these expensive toys were figured to never be used and put together on the cheap (implying graft and money laundering and such) so a lot of them simply don't work anymore or never did.","2019-10-19 17:36:14","1","overthehilltotheleft","1747937946.489373","our planet is dying","manual"

Wait... this is confusing. So UFO/UAP is a government psyop or a government coverup? You seem to waffle back and forth on this.

>""But every last time we get to this stage or just beyond, they fuck it up. They are the Satan, the destroying force. Humanity keeps getting reset. That's why there are so many pieces of evidence of so-called ""alien life"" out there. But imagine if time was no object. Imagine if 30,000 or 100,000 years could go by before we could even try again. Imagine if a man was reduced to barbarians who had no technology for a million years. No spark to set them going, progressing back up. It would seem some advanced alien race came here, seeded our planet, gave rise to us. But that's all BS. We were the aliens. It's always been us. That's what they don't want you to know. Next year Open Eyes takes place and the truth will be revealed no more drip disclosure.""

Open eyes disclosure/ Document releases

> ""Beginning in the 1950s, we already had the technology to broadcast imagery into the sky. The true state of technology is always 50-100-1000 years ahead of what is projected in society. The Germans were working with levitation in the 1940s. America was turning ships invisible, and sometimes teleporting them halfway across the world. The technology we know about is just the oldest cream of the crop. The newest stuff is always hidden and secret for at least 50 years while the majority is 100 to 1000 years in Advancement. So this whole UFO thing is total bullshit. There aren't any aliens or UFOs. They've been broadcasting these holograms in the sky and in the faces of astronauts for years. And then they tell the astronauts not to disclose any information. Most are disloyal to the country and loyal to the Military-Industrial Complex/Government, so they say nothing""
