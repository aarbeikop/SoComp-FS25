It’s not the typical genre I gravitate to. I never considered myself an “ecologist”, but I figured it would be educational.

What I saw next, turned my world upside down.

I have always enjoyed a good steak or burger. Every time I travel to NYC, I pay a visit to Shake Shack (thankfully they opened one in Newton, MA). I’m a frequent at Smith & Wollensky in Boston, I can’t eat enough of the fried-dough burgers at Jerry Remmy’s (it’s a shameful addiction). Overall, I love meat.

Why did this change? I believe strongly in integrity and doing what is right. Until we find an alternative way to produce meat, I won’t be eating any.

**So, what’s the point?**

In short, the film explores the growing crisis concerning animal agriculture and the mystery behind its cover up. Hence, Cowspiracy.

According to the AFOLU, livestock covers 45% of the worlds land. Surprised? Maybe not, we do eat an awful lot.

Here’s the point; the animal agriculture industry extends its influence into every home in America, whether you like it or not. They are an untamed behemoth, too big to fail.

As we all know, anything that is too big to fail, shouldn’t exist in the first place.

Sounds like the 2008 economic crisis all over again… Except this time, it’s cows, chickens, and pigs instead of the housing market.

Who’s at the helm, you may ask? Everyone who eats meat.

**Why is this dangerous?**

>""Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.""

Surprised now? It gets better. The animal agriculture industry accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation industry combined.

This doesn’t even begin to cover the unfathomable damage done to the environment by this already cruel and controversial economic powerhouse.

What else? Livestock emits 65% of human related nitrous oxide, the Cowspiracy fact sheet states, a gas that is 296 times as destructive as carbon dioxide to our atmosphere. Looks like this is a little more serious than just “cow farts”, what a woman in the industry laughs about incessantly in the film.

By the way, it’s also turning much of the world into desert because of overgrazing. Already, 1/3rd of the planet is desert, and raising livestock for food is the leading cause of this ever growing desertification.

Perhaps the most shocking thing about this, is that almost no one has any clue it is even a problem. The unending corruption roots itself deeper into our society than you might think.

Even our ecological protection organizations won’t address this issue. Why? It boils down to the root of all evil, of course; money. After all, they’re humans just like us. With enough dough, it seems anyone can falter morally these days.

If I hadn’t watched this documentary, I would have never known. And to think, I almost scrolled past it...

Not so surprisingly, they want to keep the public ignorant, and will go to great lengths to do so, including murder. Sister Dorothy Stang in Brazil, an American activist who fought against the industry which is resposible for 91% of Amazon destruction, was gunned down in 2005. She was shot once in the abdomen, again in the back, and four times in the head.

Not only is this industry willing to gruesomely silence nuns to keep things hush hush, but also, they lack any sense of moral compass (beyond the fact that, well, they’re willing to kill nuns).

>“82% of starving children live in countries where food is fed to animals, and the animals are eaten by western countries.”

Now that, is absurd. Sustinance is being grown within these peoples reach, in their backyard, yet they starve and die everyday while we (westerners) waste interminable amounts of food. I can’t begin to tell you how many steak leftovers I’ve thrown away because, “it doesn’t taste right when you warm it up.” I wish I could go back and slap myself across my smug little fat face.

In the 21st century, we’re still letting people die for increased profit margins. It makes me sick. The blood isn’t just on the hands of big businesses, it’s on yours and mine too. Why? For doing nothing.

So, let’s get to work.

**What does this say about us?**

We’re on a crash course for destruction. The emissions from livestock will go nowhere but up with our forever growing population, and people don’t intend on eating any less meat. In just a few years, we will exceed the healthy levels of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane in the atmosphere. We are on the verge of a mass extinction greater than the one we are already experiencing.

>Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction.

Essentially, we are supporting an industry that is motivated solely by profit. There is no compassion, there is no integrity, there is no responsibility, there is no accountability.

So, I decided I had to make a change. I decided to wash the blood from my hands.

In the film, the reasons for becoming vegan are made clear. What did it for me? The knowlegde that you are saving one animal’s life a day and beggining to put a stop to the profit-driven animal agriculture industry. Just like that, and I became a vegan.

Know that you can make a difference; one step at a time.

Rather than discuss in greater detail why this is important, I’ll leave you with this; what right do we have to destroy the very planet that gave us life in the first place?

P.S. If you can’t already tell, I highly recommend watching Cowspiracy. If you want greater clarification, you will find it there. Join the movement!

That means means we don't have to use other materials to make things like shoes and such. So that's less waste for the planet, and less wilderness being bulldozed to grow cotton for our non-leather clothing. 

I guess what I'm saying is, if we're going to kill a bunch of cows (which I'm staunchly against), shouldn't we at least use the rest of the animal, rather than wasting it?

But I've had people look at my leather shoes and tell me I'm not a vegan. And I imagine there must be other points I just haven't considered.
