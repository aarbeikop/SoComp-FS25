As this sub gets older and sees increased traffic, more often, it will be interesting to see some of the data drilldowns. I know it would be hard to draw causative conclusions, it may be informative nonetheless to check out a given window of time like the release of this Netflix production vs our subscriber count. As time goes by, we may be able to notice trends. 

I think it will be important to have a good understanding of what factors or influences lead people to collectively come to believe in climate change driven collapse. The Hopium part of me seems to believe that there may come a time when there are a series of serious weather related events in important enough regioms that large portions of society come to accept it in a wave. In that aspect, I think collapse will be a lot like recessions... there will be some people who continue to make fun of the “bears” for accepting reality, but a watershed series of moments will occur and a lot of people will change their viewpoints.

"ek1rpe6","t3_b90xpn","b90xpn","collapse","skeptical","So, everybody knows, becoming aware of Chaotic Global Warming leading to Chaotic Climate Change, that it is a ramp? It is definitely a ramp up and the only question is if the ramp is additive or going geometric? Increasing to geometric ramp increase makes the effect projections much easier.  
  
Global oil consumption is on a steady additive ramp up.  
[Global oil consumption to 2017](http://www.thenrgroup.net/peakoil/Oil-Consumption.gif)  
  
It needs to immediately ramp down from here to 0 by 2040, for Zero Emissions. That is just oil and not considering the growing demand for more coal plants. Coal may seem archaic but the whole northeast US has hundreds and hundreds of legacy coal electric plants. So, it is pretty clear that never happens.

"ekig5j5","t3_bbduvm","bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","Great post.  I'd like to add a few more points on how I coped:

* Get less attached or even better, completely rid of your chemical dependencies.  Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, etc.  It's either you learn this now or learn this later cold turkey.  Like in the war simulator [This War of Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_War_of_Mine), survivors with dependencies on alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, at best suffer alone, at worst, find themselves easy victims to doing things they would rather not do to fuel their habits.

>This makes you anxious. Scared. Depressed. Suicidal even. If the end of the world is inevitable, why even bother, right? Stop. Take a second. Relax. Breathe.

* If you can't change the outer world, change the inner world.  Related to that earlier point, I found [meditation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL603BD0B03E12F5A1) of profound help in this.  And it's exactly like in the quoted text, just breathe.  From the simple act of observing our breath, there's immense depth in this practice and you'll find it much easier to deal with the reality we are living in.","2019-04-10 00:24:04","13","xorandor","1747926668.664495","our planet is dying","manual"

"ekja5uv","t3_bbduvm","bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","Good point. I think people need to find their own mission and you're right on the money. We still have 10 years!!!


Underrated message of the year.


I plan on opening up a bar this year (hopefully), use that money to expand into a soft dev business and hopefully take it from there. I wanna start a gin distillery, build an app, write more books etc!


This whole thing needs to be framed properly. Knowing it's all going to shit gives me more power to push myself to do things that I probably would not do. I make a ton of money compared to the avg where I live (EU) and I could probably ride it out in corporate forever. But now's the time to take more chances. 


You're right, not a lot I can do to stop it and I've been a vegetarian for 7 years now but because I am into animal rights more than anything. Still living the life I want on my own terms but going full throttle forward! Choo choo motherfuckers!

And if you're too caught up in your own head about collapse, do what I did. Imagine your life 10, 20 years from now and write that shit down. Whatever it is. I wrote a book imagining what it will be like. It does give you some mental comfort, at least it did for me. Now it doesn't seem like the boogeyman that has too many unpredictable and uncertainties around it, cause that's what's actually what's scary. Not knowing what will happen and how you'll react.","2019-04-10 09:14:12","2","sinkmyteethin","1747926668.667899","our planet is dying","manual"

"ekjqh3x","t3_bbduvm","bbduvm","collapse","skeptical",">*At the very least* start stockpiling food and water.

I don't know about stocking the water, you know most water is contained in plastics and given the fact that summers are incredibly hot there is now way that the water will stay clean, not toxicated with the polymers.

Even if you stock it in glass under earth with no sunlight in cold temperature, just count:

If you drink 3 litres per day it's 1000 litres (1 m^(3)) per year only for drinking. Water for growing or cooking is not included.

This is my most fearful thought, you just can't effectively stockpile water imho. There is problem with the space and purity of the water. Any contaminated water is still better than no water, you could somehow filtrate it, but... I don't know, it seems imposible for me imho.","2019-04-10 14:07:06","3","Bubis20","1747926668.674337","our planet is dying","manual"
