"61e639","collapse","skeptical","The collapse will commence around 2025-2030. Enjoy your last 8-13 years.","1.  The purpose of this post is to provide some interesting correlations between commodity prices, peak oil, human population, and global warming.  This is not extensive, and I know my title is ""sweeping"" - but that's the conclusion that I draw from this basic research - so please feel free to agree or disagree - but please state your disagreement with some evidence if possible (yeah right - there's very little evidence to counter the collapse - I challenge someone to provide evidence against the immanent collapse within the next couple of decades)

2.  Here's an article about russia preparing for $40 for the next few years. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-24/opec-be-warned-russia-battens-down-the-hatches-for-oil-at-40  The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that it seems likely that commodities will in fact remain depressed for at least the foreseeable future - likely until the mid 2020s.

3.  Here's a graph of the 20-30 year commodity cycle - note were basically at the base right now, but the next peak appears to begin around 2025 or so, and spike around 2035. http://aheadoftheherd.com/1Articles/DavidChapman/2012/Stifel-Nicolaus-cycles_files/image001.jpg

4.  Here's a graph of the peak oil timeline: http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/energy/_Media/mkh_oil.jpeg

5.  Peak oil is still going to happen - don't worry folks, oil consumption is still freaking massive right now and exponentially growing each year - commodity prices just naturally go through long term cycles. We are currently in this base that is currently forming for virtually all commodities, and this may last for at least a few more years - maybe as much as 6 or 8 years.

However, right around the 2025 mark, where peak oil begins to exponentially accelerate downwards - the next commodity cycle is predicted to occur simultaneously - the confluence of the natural cycle of commodities with this EPIC peak oil scenario will result in one of the most massive commodity price spikes in human history - the result of which will absolutely devastate the worlds economy and most of modern civilization. We got a taste of this back in 2008-2012, the Arab spring, the devastation of the middle east was just a hint of what's going to happen to the entire planet by the late 2020s.

-   Simultaneously, human population will be approaching the 9 billion mark - http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/population_change_structure_rev1.shtml

-  To make matters far more complicated, by 2025 run away climate change will possibly be in full swing, if not fully commencing - which will further add to the pressure on commodity prices, and human population - potentially causing a spike in commodity prices and resource scarcity so large that the prices of commodities could in and of itself collapse civilization.

My research really isn't so comprehensive, basic graphs on basic subjects - but the timeline does appear to be catastrophic around the 2025-2035 point.

If by 2035 there's any more than 5 billion humans left on this planet I would honestly be shocked.  By 2050, we will very likely be extinct (unfortunately, along with virtually all other complex forms of life on this planet).

- In conclusion I would suggest that you do not have children if it can be helped - unless you are mentally prepared to appreciate the fact that they'll be dead before they reach the age of 15, likely of starvation, or worse.  Prepare as best you can, but this is likely going to affect everyone - regardless of how much paper money you have.  If anything, invest your money in commodities - farm land probably #1.  It's going to be tough to predict where to buy farmland in light of runaway global warming however.  

- If the system doesn't go to complete shit, commodity stocks are probably going to get very expensive, but timing is going to be damn near impossible to figure out - you could see a 50% drop within the next several years if you buy now - but in the long run, if the stock market is still functioning and society is still in tact - you'll probably become very rich if you time a commodity investment correctly - this will be important, because the cost of food is going to go through the damn roof and you'll need as much help as you can get.  I suppose one could invest in precious metals as a ""layman"" interested in investing in commodities, as they will, along with everything else skyrocket in price during the next commodity boom.  Stocks are obviously far more profitable but the average person may find stock market investing to be tricky, risky, and emotionally draining.  (TBH if the shit REALLY hits the fan, precious metals will not be worth too terribly much if anything at all, but they are a great ""laymans"" way to get exposure to the commodity market.

- Real estate is tricky - I don't know how that's going to go with the next commodity boom - last time housing prices dropped like a lead balloon during the commodity boom of 2008-2011 - I suspect the same thing will happen again.  I've seen predictions that housing prices will be at their lowest level around 2025, right when commodity prices are predicted to begin skyrocketing.  

- Prepper items, like ham radios, SHTF gear, etc may actually do quite well in price if they are cared for - as I would imagine there will be hyperinflation simultaneous with the commodity spike.  This sort of stuff can be seen as an investment, as it can be bartered just as easily if not way better than precious metals .  Guns will probably be in high demand as well, and may represent a fantastic long term investment.  Long term storable dehydrated food, like mountainhouse cans, etc will probably keep their purchasing power to an extent.

To be totally honest, I find it disappointing that we're going to have to be patient for another 8-13 years.  Collapse fatigue is very real, and watching our planet slowly die is incredibly depressing and morally devastating.  


- EDIT:  Some may ask:  Why bother investing and preparing for the collapse of civilization if we're all going to be extinct by 2050 or so?  

- My response would be a simple question:  Do you want to be one of the hundreds of poor motherfuckers drowning in the ocean when the ship sinks - or do you want to be the guy on the life raft who had to eat his two buddies just to stay alive for the next 6 months, only to slowly die from dehydration and starvation as help never arrives?  

EDIT 2:  Holy shit this is a long post.

TLDR:  Commodity prices, peak oil, human population, and climate change are all going to converge on one another around the 2025-2030 mark - leading to the largest spike in commodity prices and resource scarcity in human history - the resulting carnage will ultimately lead to the collapse of human civilization.  There are ways you can prepare in order to survive long enough on the life raft to observe the ship wreck from the distance.

"62erem","collapse","skeptical","When will you call it collapse?","""How will the collapse happen? And when?"", two questions that show up in this sub...all day,  every day. 

Perhaps these are the right questions to ask, but the wrong way of asking them.   Maybe the real question is,  ""At what point will you personally call what is happening around you collapse?""

For millions of former ""middle class"" Syrians, collapse is in the rear view mirror quite firmly, as well as lining the road ahead. 

For millions of dying animal populations feeling pressured by humans all the time, collapse is right here,  right now. 

For the world's fish collapse is very real as well.  Articles talk about collapsing fish populations and the impact on humanity with very little talk about what it means to other fish.  We aren't the only ones who like to eat sea bass, sardines and ahi you know.  Fish, in fact, are the world's number one consumers of fish.  Humans and bears come in second and third. 

Speaking of, polar bears are drowning every day.  Flocks of birds drop out of the sky,  dead.   Millions of fish wash up on shores.  200 species disappear from this planet forever, every day.   (Derrick Jenson asked this)  At what point do you call it collapse?  500 species a day?   A thousand? 

Is collapse  when your neighbors start getting evicted?  Your family?  Yourself?   Is it when the majority of citizens no longer have assets? 

Is it when the power goes out several hours a day?   Like in Pyongyang?   Is it when millions of your countrymen starve over several years?  Like the rest of North Korea? 

Does collapse happen when your young child comes home from school and excitedly tells you what they want to be when they grow up,  and you listen and smile,  and die inside... Knowing that it won't happen,  and not through any fault of the child.  

Does collapse happen knowing that your child will not do as ""well"" as you have.   

Does it happen when you realize you won't do as ""well"" as your parents did? 

Did collapse happen for you when Orwellian fiction slipped into prophecy?  Or will it take waking up in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in our easy to imagine Margaret Atwoodesque future?  Maybe it will take piles of bodies like Stephen King's ""The Stand"" to call it collapse? 

Does collapse happen the day credit stops?   The day food stops?   The day gas stops?  Like has already happened in South America's most prosperous country,  Venezuela? 

Or do these things have to happen in Germany,  Japan, or Australia to be called collapse?  Or does it have to happen on the death star itself to really be considered collapse?

And does all of America count equally towards collapse?  If the gas and groceries stop being delivered to Nucla, Colorado, Aims, Iowa,  and Cleweston, Florida does it count as much as Dallas, New York, and LA? 

Does economic collapse happen when Lloyd Blankfein raids your 401k leaving you to work till the day you die?   Or does it take all ATMs ceasing to dispense cash to anyone including those who should have some?

Is it collapse when your neighbors kids don't know where their next meal is coming from?   Or when your kids don't.

Is it when the death rate clearly exceeds the birth rate?  Will we even know if this happens? 

My point is that collapsing is probably more akin to dying from a million tiny cuts rather than Road Warrior to Mad Max route.

Collapsing will be personal, and experienced by each one of us differently.   It will be a global problem that happens on a local level...a personal level. 

No one would ever know for sure if they were the last person on earth.  I am sure there have been people throughout history who have wondered, because they were close in proximity  to catastrophes.

Is collapse like the giant casinos in Las Vegas?  Does it get harder to see the closer you are to it?

At what point will Anderson Cooper call it collapse over the air? 

At what point exactly will YOU call it collapse?","2017-03-30 15:48:07","155","88","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/62erem/when_will_you_call_it_collapse/","True","Monkeyboylopez","1747881424.1387079","our planet is dying","manual"

Our blue planet, Earth, is home 2.2 million species, from the colossal blue whale to the small and psychedelic peacock mantis shrimp! The oceans are vastly diverse, yet there are up to 100 million species that haven't been discovered. Our oceans don't just give life to sea animals: 1 billion people in developing countries rely on fishing as their primary source of food, and the oceans aquatic plants provide 70% of the oxygen we breathe.

**However, our oceans are in deep trouble.**

Our oceans are dying, fast. All marine wildlife populations have halved during the past 40 years, with some species, such as tuna, having fallen by over 70%. Why is this happening? Pollution, habitat destruction, climate change, over-fishing and fish-farming, etc... By 2050, all sea life will be gone forever; we don't have long until we hit our #OceanDeadline. We still have time to stop this event, but we need your help, now!

**How can you help us?**

The simplest, most effective way you can save the ocean today is to eat less fish or, better yet, avoid seafood entirely! We are overfishing our oceans to extinction. Trillions of fish are caught each year, yet millions more are killed by abandoned fishing gear, discarded as by-products and farmed to feed other animals like chickens. Even the ecosystems fish live on are being eaten away by overfishing.

**Why should we care about fish?**

The biggest victim of ocean extinction are the animals who live there- fish! Fish are so much more than we originally thought they were: they have excellent memories, highly developed senses and show complex social behaviours but, most importantly, they seek comfort and avoid pain, just like you and I. Fish have even been known to form friendships with humans! A local diver in Japan has been visiting the same fish – a sheapshead wrasse called Yoriko – for over 25 years: Yoriko enjoys being petted, and returns to greet his diving friend every day, just for a kiss. Each fish killed was an individual who wanted to live.

**Our future can and will change!**

We don't have to lose our oceans to overfishing. Together, we can beat this #OceanDeadline. Together, we can save our world. Not only do people rely on us to protect their food source, we need to give marine life a chance to survive past the year 2050. If we go fish-free, or eat less fish from now, then we can have a fish-full future!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Most ancient legends have 2 things in common, a giant flood and a northern race of giants. In the late 1890s and 1930s hundreds of ancient giant skeletons were found throughout New England and parts of the South East, in North America.

12,000 years ago the earth flooded when hit by a solar flare of such magnitude that it may have short circuited some ancient pyramids. Ancient humans lived underground out of fear for years. Many of our churches are built at entrances that hid these dwellings. When you have evidence of 8 foot ancient peoples, it is the height of greed to hide it. This of course all happened during the great credit and currency privatisation of 1913, back when it was called thievery instead of neoliberalism.

Abraham Lincoln's Meditation On The Ancient Giant Race
---------------------------------------------------------------

This video is a stonemason's research on ancient stone mounds and gets good at the 40:00 mark. The egg shaped stone is the 3rd hardest stone to drill into and requires a modern concrete drill bit. Ancient giants knew metallurgy and were magical stone masons. The heights of these ancient giant skeletons runs 7 to 10 feet. Legends put them slightly larger. Do you want to know what Abraham Lincoln said about them? We are mis-under-informed.

The Mega Solar Flare Of 12,800 Years Ago And The Great Flood
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This next podcast is a geologist's opinion about the major solar flare event 12,800 years ago that very quickly melted down enough ice to flood the planet. He says the solar event caused many quakes and volcanos to go off. Maps tell us the giant race were excellent navigators. Most of them died off in villages 400 feet below current sea levels. Thus the second phase of sea rise will sink our civilization, and if any mountain fortress survivors remain I hope they remember us.

Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings: Evidence of Advanced Civilization in the Ice Age 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles Hapgood’s classic 1966 book on ancient maps is back in print after 20 years. Hapgood produces concrete evidence of an advanced worldwide civilization existing many thousands of years before ancient Egypt. He has found the evidence in many beautiful maps long known to scholars, the Piri Reis Map that shows Antarctica, the Hadji Ahmed map, the Oronteus Finaeus and other amazing maps. Hapgood concluded that these maps were made from more ancient maps from the various ancient archives around the world, now lost. Hapgood also concluded that the ancient mapmakers were in some ways much more advanced scientifically than Europe in the 16th century, or than the ancient civilizations of Greece, Egypt, and Babylonian. Not only were these unknown people more advanced in mapmaking than any people prior to the 18th century, it appears they mapped all the continents. The Americas were mapped thousands of years before Columbus. Antarctica was mapped when its coasts were free of ice. There is evidence that these people must have lived when the ice age had not yet ended in the Northern Hemisphere and when Alaska was still connected with Siberia by the Pleistocene, ice age “land bridge.”
