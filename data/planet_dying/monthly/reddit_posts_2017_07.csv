"6mwph1","environment","emotional","Solution to the Forrest fenn ""thrill of the chase"" - Climate change","We’ve all read these headlines before, “Anonymous woman thinks she has solved the mystery of Forrest Fenn’s Thrill of the Chase”.  What is going to make this story different? Why should we trust the information from this anonymous source? While this woman does not claim to have the treasure in hand, she felt her discovery was far too important to remain hidden any longer.  And in light of recent tragedies surrounding the death of a treasure searcher, she decided to tell her story.  As you read through the findings, you will see that solution is quite timely in the news.
 
It was the fourth of July, when she first heard about the thrill of the chase.  Intrigued by this hidden chest of gold that was hidden in the woods in 2010, she began to read more about other people’s stories. “I had the day off, so I decided to try my hand at solving the clues to the poem.  Unfortunately, I didn’t solve it on the 4th, but on the evening of the 5th, after putting my kids to bed, I thought I discovered a very important clue to the location of the treasure chest.” A clue that had her flying to Taos, New Mexico on July the 7th.  “I told my boss on the 6th that I am taking Friday off.  He looked at me very surprised, since I very rarely just take a vacation day.”
 
At the time, the anonymous women truly felt her earlier interpretations fit.  “The genius of the poem, is that you can easily convince yourself that something fits.  However, while I was in Taos, I soon realized I was trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole.” Some of her interpretations that led her to Taos included a house called Caja Del Tesoro, which literally translates into treasure chest. But when she searched the area, called Arroyo Seco, there was nothing she could make fit.
 
While the woman would like to remain anonymous, she is willing to reveal she is a scientist. “I like to think in hypothesis testing and probabilities. I tested my hypothesis on Arroyo Seco, and I was wrong. It was time to move on.  Rather, I spent Saturday touring beautiful sites in the area, while thinking about probabilities.”  
 
“I realized that to solve this poem, I need to start at the beginning.  And I would not move onto the second clue until I had a higher level of certainty with my first solution. The first clue would have to be precise, since it indicates the starting point on the search.  So I kept telling myself, you must be precise. In Arroyo Seco I was not moving with precision, rather I felt like a mosquito desperately searching for blood.”
 
So let’s start at the most realistic starting point of the search, the beginning.  The second stanza of the poem starts “let’s begin where warm waters halt.”  The anonymous woman describes how the properties of water always have them in movement to some degree.  Therefore, the only way that waters halt is if they turn into ice. “I remember thinking that there is a lot of ice on this planet.  I did a search for glaciers in the US, and realized that I may not be able to pinpoint with any degree of certainty a single glacier to start from.   I then looked at the stanza as a whole, and then it hit me.  He was describing the location of ice during the ice age. A time, when ice literally came down as far south as the Brown’s stadium (The house of Brown).”   The anonymous woman says she thought about this ice formation for about a half hour. “As I mentioned before, it is so easy to convince yourself you are correct. I couldn’t prove I was correct, but I felt I had a higher level of certainty, so I felt confident enough to move on”
 
Within the next stanza of the poem, it describes it being no place for the meek.  “I felt the word meek was incredibly important. I studied so many possibilities, looking into alternative translations of the word.  Again, thinking about precision, I doubted my ability to feel confident enough to settle on any one location. I thought of remaining glaciers, especially in hard to reach areas.  But which one? I studied this stanza for an hour, and then it truly hit me, this poem is about climate change. And it fit for every line of the poem.”
 
The anonymous woman admits that she cannot show with 100% probability that this assessment is correct. “Unless I have the treasure in my hand, no one will believe my story.  But as I read this poem from a climate change point of view, I sense his desperation to shout out at the top of his lungs.  I talk to the public weekly, and sometimes daily, many with very strong and passionate feelings about environmental issues. I am an empathetic person by nature, so I tried to put myself in Fenn’s shoes.  He wants to leave behind a legacy. What greater legacy than bringing people back to nature.”
 
“I want to caution everyone that this is just another interpretation. Whether you agree or disagree with my solution, I wanted to share my results, since it is going to take a comprehensive effort to make the final interpretation of this poem.  But As you read through the poem, think about it from a perspective of climate change, and you can judge for yourself where it leads us next.”
 
The anonymous woman describes some of her line by line interpretations. “When Fenn writes that there it is no place for the meek, I feel he trying to raise his concerns that if climate change continues, there will literally be no place for the meek, since the meek are supposed to inherit the Earth. If Fenn feels this strongly, then it is no surprise that he continues to write that the end is every drawing nigh (near).”
 
Fenn continues to write about heavy loads and waters high.  With climate change, the major concerns are the heavy carbon emissions and rising sea levels. Fenn has made reference in news stories to people being within 200 feet. “Well to support my hypothesis even further, I’d like to refer to several researchers that have reported that if all of the ice on earth melts, the sea level will rise 200 feet.”  
 
The anonymous woman points out that a lot of effort by searchers went into figuring out what was referred to as the blaze in the poem.   “If you are wise and see the blaze, look down your quest will cease. But tarry scant with marvel gaze, take the chest and rest in peace.” The anonymous woman interprets this stanza as the blaze being the path we are setting before us. “I feel he is saying that If we look down and do nothing, we will cease to exist.  But if we limit our use of fossil fuels, and enjoy nature, we can sleep soundly at night that our earth’s treasures will still be there.”
 
“As I continue to read the last two stanzas, I feel he is just expressing his own concerns. When someone feels passionately about a subject, they feel helpless. I feel his is very passionate on the topic, feeling helpless, and is hoping to scream out and make people listen.”  The anonymous woman feels the last few lines are about asking people to make an effort.  “I feel he is asking us to help make an effort to in order to enjoy cooler weather, as opposed to global warming.”
 
While the anonymous woman feels the poem is about climate change, she wants to remain out of the spotlight on her own viewpoint on the subject. “I drive a Prius, I compost and recycle, and try to make good choices. As a scientist, I can study how changes in climate impact ecosystems, but I see where the science leads, and am careful to always weigh both sides of any argument.”  While the woman doesn’t want to be on the spotlight on the subject, she pointed out that climate change has been in the news a lot this week, with a massive ice sheet breaking away from Antarctica, and record reaching temperatures this week.
 
The most important thing the anonymous woman wants to share is that she feels this is just a poem about climate change, and most likely does not hide a hidden clue to a treasure. While it is possible there is a double meaning to these clues, she feels it is very unlikely you can use this as a map to a treasure chest.  “Again, I thought about this in context of probability and hypothesis testing. If this was truly a map, the clues would need to include precision. I am confident that the first clue describes the formation of ice over north America during the ice age.  This is not a precise location. So, there is no way to move on from there.”
 
“I think that after this posting goes viral, people will still try to interpret the clues in this poem.  The only way I could have had 100% probability is if I had the chest in hands. I hope people will take my interpretation for what it is, an interpretation. I was enticed by the thrill of the chase, and found the idea of stumbling across $2 million of treasure worth exploring.  While I didn’t find the chest in my adventure to Taos, I got to see a part of the country I have never seen before. This in itself was a great treasure to me.”
 
The woman did not mention if she will continue to stay anonymous. “I emailed Forrest Fenn my findings, so at least he knows who I am. Oddly enough, I think I probably have a few things in common with Forrest Fenn. And just like Fenn’s writings, if you try hard enough, you might find enough clues to come up with an interpretation of who I am.”  The woman also admits there is a strong possibility the last stanza is asking the person who solves the poem to share the information publicly.  “If this information goes public, then hopefully Forrest Fenn can weigh in on the topic, and let us know the true meaning. But I feel that given that several people have died from this chase, I would be doing a huge disservice to other searchers that may be risking their lives out there. “

"6kv1xh","conspiracy","unknown","Something fishy is going on. Evidence for a meta-conspiracy.","This post argues a simple idea: that something fishy is going on.

By ""fishy"" I mean that the fundamental truth behind our physical and social realities is not what is obvious or apparent. That is to say, there is a meta-conspiracy, meaning I do not know what the actual conspiracy is, but whatever the truth is it is either not obvious at all or is being hidden from us.

While misinformation and dead-ends make it difficult to find a cohesive, holistic theory, the suspiciousness of it all remains. There are too many loose ends.

Whatever accounts for the mysteries outlined in this post is something beyond the unsatisfying answers spoon-fed to us by the TPTB.

**DMT**

Check out [Jordan Peterson - The Mystery of DMT and Psilocybin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gol5sPM073k) for a short intro to the unexplainable and mind-blowing nature of DMT and Psilocybin.

The incredible experiences reported by DMT users cannot be hand-waved away, and there does not exist satisfying scientific-materialistic theory for these experiences. 

Then we have the stifling of DMT research along with it's illegality around the world. Why does the scientific community for the most part ignore DMT? Why is it banned in so many countries? 

This beautiful mystery sits right in front of us. It's a not a secret base in the ocean, it's not a portal in antarctica, it's right fucking there. Anyone can take DMT. Anyone can see it for themselves. And yet the truth remains hidden and our governments actively prevent research.

**Dreams**

I think dreams are a big clue into the nature of reality, but occur so commonly that we forget how incredible they are. 

Consider if you were an outsider, not yet born, and were described what earth was like: the ecology and biology of plants and animals, all the science behind mother nature, etc. Once you knew all this - would you be able predict that all mammals dream? Is it all obvious? Of course not, which is why no scientific 
 theory predicts dreaming. All science has given us is after-the-fact explanations.

So what is the answer? How come every night our consciousness dies a sort of death, we perceive a new reality, and then several hours later our normal consciousness returns?

Then we have to consider group dreaming. Entire villages have woken up having all had the same very specific dream. Google ""collective dreaming"", ""group dreaming"", or ""shared dreams"" to find more on group dreaming. There are numerous credible cases you can look into.

There is also some evidence that dreams foreshadow events. People will laugh at this, until they've had it themselves. They experience a very specific and hyper-real dream, see it acted out in real life, and _just know_.

**Near-death Experiences**

Like DMT, near-death experiences are largely ignored by the scientific community.

>  The medical community has been reluctant to address the phenomenon of NDEs, and grant money for research has been scarce.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Research

Doesn't it seem odd to you that one of the most remarkable experiences which is reported by millions of people worldwide and throughout history is largely ignored?

Why would this be? Has science already have it figured out? Am I making much ado about nothing?

Let's look at wikipedia again:

> Neuroscience research suggests that an NDE is a subjective phenomenon resulting from ""disturbed bodily multisensory integration"" that occurs during life-threatening events

Does that sound like an answer to you? 

Is ""disturbed bodily multisensory integration"" at all satisfying? 

The truth is that nobody really knows what near-death experiences are. What we do have are thousands and thousands of personal accounts of what are in most cases irrevocably life-changing experiences. Experiences that are reported to feel ""more real than real"".

**UFOs**

Aliens and UFOs are a topic that has trapped many intellectuals. What starts as a curiosity becomes all-consuming, as it becomes apparent the journey for truth on this topic is endless. Were it a submarine mission to the bottom of the ocean, the ocean would be bottomless.

Like all topics on this list the answer is not obvious, but there are some facts we can agree on:

* Unknown lights and flying structures have appeared in the sky.
* Government explanations for these objects are unsatisfactory, contradictory, and/or non-existent.
* Numerous officials and whistleblowers have come forward with explanations for UFOs/aliens. As a group, their answers are also contradictory.

Even if we accept the simplest explanation, it would still mean our governments are lying to us, that secret technology exists, and that among us there exist hidden groups with hidden motives.

In short, something fishy is going on.

**Music**

I believe music is evidence for some sort of spirituality in humans.

The fact that sounds make us feel emotions is so inconceivably bizarre I have to wonder why it is not brought up more in subreddits like this.

Most animals have sight. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. The survival benefit is obvious. The benefit to music is not obvious. Google ""evolutionary explanation music"" and what you'll find are dozens of guesswork explanations. We don't know why music has the multitude of effects it does. 

It would make more sense if music wasn't a thing. It would make more sense if humans throughout history did not spend countless hours practicing an activity that has no obvious survival benefit. And even if music should exist, why is the experience transcendent? We enjoy candy without feeling like we are moved to a higher place. Why should music be any different? Music moves us in a way in should not be able to. It's fishy as fuck.

**The technology curve**

This is an original argument, which I will briefly outline here. I saved it for last because it is difficult to explain.

In short, the laws of this universe, along with our place in it, are to our benefit far beyond what is required for our existence.

If we are to exist, the laws of physics must be constrained to allow the sun, planets, biology, natural evolution, etc to be possible. That is a given. Likewise, the earth requires certain features for the possibility of our evolution. We need a specific temperature range, access to food, water, and to materials and environments sufficient for our evolution, just to name a few.

But why should any technological advancement beyond this be possible? Why are the laws of physics and the materials available on this earth such that it is possible to build and fly an airplane? I can conceive of a universe where air density works slightly different, making flight impossible. But yet here we are. 

Flight is just one example. We can ask the same for most modern technology: cars, skyscrapers, bridges, phones, satellites, submarines, boats, the internet.

Imagine a universe where we invent the internet, turn it on, but laws of physics are such that moving information through copper (or any other material) is an order of magnitude slower. In this case, a large portion of internet activity becomes impossible. But this didn't happen, did it?

It appears to me that nearly all technology that humans could possible want just so happens to be attainable. Okay, so not instant teleportation, and not perfect medicine. But for the most part, everything that can be imagined has turned out to be possible.

The earth just happens to have billions of gallons of oil which is perfect for combustion. And oh look, silicon makes for great CPUs and it just so happens to be the most abundant compound in the earth's crust. 

It's almost as if a technological path has been prepared for humans, laid out for us to discover like a tech-tree in a video game. We explore the mountains, then the oceans, then the sky, and oh look - a moon closeby for our first step into space exploration.

Why were we not forever doomed to live as apes? ","2017-07-02 19:19:26","273","156","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6kv1xh/something_fishy_is_going_on_evidence_for_a/","True","Zunh","1747889383.861111","our planet is dying","manual"
