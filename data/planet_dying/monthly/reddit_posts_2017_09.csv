- Intro

First off, I'm a 9th grade drop out, so please expect some bad grammar/spelling here and there. This is a very long post, and if you aren't absolutely dying to have a better understanding of life's greatest mysteries, and perhaps even you'd rather not know, just move on.

I researched conspiracy theories for 8 years to get here. I did that long enough to be utterly certain one of three things was happening: 1. these events were taking place, 2. someone wanted us to believe they were taking place. 3. Both 1 and 2. So I stopped researching them, and began looking for clues as to why they'd want us to believe these things. I went back to the JFK 'The President and the Press' speech, and in that speech, I just couldn't help but notice all the emphasis he was placing on Karl Marx, and secret societies. He even closes the speech with Francis Bacon. To me, and especially if listened to (the audio), it sounds as if he is addressing his own cult members. They laugh nervously, and at the wrong points to things which aren't even funny without some sort of insider jokes/knowledge, and get dead silent as he moves into secret societies.

This really piqued my interests, and for a time I investigated Marx, The Frankfurt School, communism and socialism. This led me to Critical Theory, Critical Pedagogy, and Radical Critical Pedagogy. These are negative social sciences. I mean quite literally negative- to sum them up, they all advocate engineered suffering. I couldn't believe what I was reading, and so I bounced from one research paper to another, and another, for a few days. There was dozens of them from all of the most respected educational institutions and think tanks in the country, and from around the world. I had finally discovered the *language* I was always looking for, but was too busy picking cherries to ever begin working my way down to the roots, and that's why cherries are there. From here, I began looking for the justifications for the negative social sciences, and I found them in abundance in continental philosophy.

It's one of the two main schools of thought in philosophy- continental and analytic. Analytic philosophy is like a Japanese sedan- kind of boring, but very reliable so long as you stay on the roads. Continental philosophy is like a 4 wheel drive jeep- it can take you anywhere. At first it appeared to have a crippling fascination with death, decay, entropy, descent, etc, but I ultimately discovered it's all to facilitate a more complete, *quickened* rebirth. But I still couldn't understand why we didn't use analytic philosophy- it seemed so much more *predictable* than continental philosophy. So I went searching for its justifications. Where else could I go at this point?

There's only one place for a westerner *left*- the Bible. 

Begin:

 - '*Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward.'*




I think I have decoded a small portion of the Bible. Well, the important parts anyhow.

We do not have the right to condemn anyone but ourselves- this is its biggest truth.

 - ""for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” - The Tree of Knowledge (disassociation)

It's about false dichotomies- rich/poor, black/white, government/people, law/chaos, man/woman, etc- it simply aims to teach us life/universe is far more complicated than this, and it is telling *our* story. It's the story of the *creation* of (the words and the ideas they give birth to)""good"" and ""evil"", **left and right**, chaos and order, and how they came into existence, and how the waters (the people, the fish, mans consciousness) were split in half- Cain and Abel (Seth), or Ephraim and Manasseh (aka The Pharisees and The Sadducees). More than this, however, it is the story of how man, and wo-man were separated from one another through the externalization of our own qualities (beauty, intelligence, righteousness, love, etc), onto everything but us, and what we had to undertake, and are still undertaking in order to get them back. It is the story of the power of (blinding) sight, language, art, music, poetry, symbols, and that which we experience, and its impact on our psyche (spirit). It's the story of mans consciousness, and how our thoughts alone make reality what it is.

Imagine the [*eyes wide open*](https://quakerdale.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/eyes-wide-open-006.jpg) - or *eyes wide shut*

[Please see origins of the Hebrew letter 'ayin'](http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_One/Aleph-Bet/Ayin/ayin.html) - ""when the eye is evil (ayin-ra), it becomes a slave to the purposes of sin""

[Human left ear:](http://finalprodigy.com/wp-content/gallery/human-ear/earsketch03.jpg) (notice the G in the center? when it's reversed it becomes a D) - it's actually a C, but we'll get to that.

The Face of God is mans face, minus his left hemisphere, I'll explain. If you look at a human head, his left ear is a G, left eye= O, right eye = O, and finally the right ear= D. What's that spell?

[GOOD](https://imgur.com/a/vo5AW) 

What's it spell after we *cross* out one of the eyeballs?

[Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo, The Creation of Adam (atom/Atum)- God is enveloped in a fleshy cloud shaped like a brain](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13nL4jJ54yQ/maxresdefault.jpg) - this is what you're told when you visit the chapel, it's a brain.

Why do we take the left eye away? Because it represents the left hemisphere of the brain, the logic center. Our feminine right brain has become the dominant brain for men, while women's left brain has become the dominate side for them- this is 'The Cross'. This is responsible for nearly every mental disorder there is, especially bipolar disorder. It's also why people are having so many gender crises, and exactly why so many people are so angry all the time. It started with cave paintings. This is when we began externalizing ourselves into art. These paintings forced us to analyze the world and ourselves in a way that separated one from the other. This is probably when we started gaining modesty, and shame, and began clothing ourselves. The Tree of Knowledge is merely the tree of disassociation, and it's where dragons (perceived power, separated from the self) come from. This turned into the drive to acquire material wealth, to compartmentalize information, and ultimately gave birth to the metanarrative of 'good'(altruism), verses 'evil'(selfishness), and the creation of the written word which started with symbols. Our *conundrum* is represented in 3 Fibonacci spirals, one for each eye, and one for the mouth, and represents 666.

 - ""That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.""



Basically the Fibonacci or Golden Ratio (in this context) is a theory about an event horizon (with 6 steps x3, one for each color)represented by a time constant, a reality constant, and a third I haven't figured out yet (I think it's perception). I think they intersect next year. The 6 days of Creation..[Spiral Dynamics](https://imgur.com/a/9tdKB) One 'step' for each color, we are in the purple phase attempting to get to the 'Golden Age'. This is why you will see so much purple in politics right now. It is representative blending blue (mans energy), and red (womens energy). Pay no attention to the captions.


Why is the left ear represented by a G and not a C? **It is a C. It's a capital C. Turn it upwards in your mind- the left and right columns represent the left and right human visual cortex. The G is the C with a stream of blinding light entering the right eye.** Sun worship is the corruption of mans ego through sight.

See the Mercedes logo in the bottom right? They know marketing, and they want you to think with your right brain- this is the material brain. This is why we are so materialistic. 

This has happened to most religions (if not all, save perhaps some of the hardcore...). They worship good, not god, and good is only as real as we allow evil to be.

Mercy is what we must have, if we choose, not 'good'.  

Satan is merely mans shadow self- the world is not going to end- it's going to experience a rebirth.

This is why the owl is on the dollar bill, and is often depicted in places of power- Shakespeare seems to have known all about it, and Picasso's works fit the bill as well. Eye's wide open because our emotional centers are incredibly overdeveloped (actually just crossed)... [owl man](https://hilo.hawaii.edu/~art/gallery/g/p/1130291757.png) His necklace represents duality. The light bulb burns bright next to his right hemisphere. He worships false idols and is enveloped in the arts.


We essentially live in modern day Egypt. It is the continuation of the oldest empire on earth. It has captured mans imagination in a virtual reality prison made of words, materialism, vanity and empty compassion/love. We are witnessing feminine destruction because of the false belief of separation (God is everywhere but within). For example, a cat can only be stealthy, cunning, and independent in your eyes if you remove these qualities from yourself. For some reason- this is a basic universal law which we have broken so many times, we're on the verge of fixing it. 

Basically, the universe gives you what you need based on your desires, but the things you acquire are just things/experiences you are checking off a really long list. It's just like the yellow brick road, you never know what you may encounter, but they will all be things you needed to experience, good or bad. I haven't been able to accomplish what I can feel the universe asking me to do, and that's to let go. When we die we simply find ourselves in someone else's body, and we forget the last body we came from. Our consciousness just couldn't handle the burden of past lives, nor the responsibility, or irresponsibility that would come with it, but that just has something to do with vibrational frequencies, and they can always be raised.

We really can manifest reality, we just haven't figured it out yet.

The Rothschild family is probably the wealthiest family on earth because they have known about this longer than anyone, and have been denying wealth and it's power over them for a long time. In other words, they'd like nothing more than to be poor and ignorant: *you get what you deny.*

The Bible describes this as 'crossing' the Jordan river. Red is the color of feminine energy and why the Jordan river runs red with blood, while mans energy is represented by white (or blue)- this is where candy canes come from.

The Bible is a massive set of contradictions. [This website](http://bibviz.com/) was designed to easily show them. There's hundreds if not thousands.

 - ""and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell."" The 'Lord' dwells with the daughters of the Canaanites (Cain).





Imagine taking a child and raising him from birth, purely on Disney films, until 20 years of age, and then placing him in the world and telling him to get a job.. He wouldn't be able to cope, he'd be asking for puppies. Now, combine all other movies, media, art, music, comic books, board games, street signs, architecture, video games, labels, logos, clothing, phone apps, events, fashion statements, protests, objects, schooling, language, conflicts, even warning labels, etc- this is aesthetic reality. Aesthetic reality gives you more tools to work with, but you still end up a shell of yourself. It decides how we view the world. Not how the world is. Aesthetic reality is constantly enforcing the metanarrative of good verses evil to take our attention away from the real power centers of our world (the purpose is much greater). Yes, struggle is real, but no one is immune to it, and the belief in good and evil gave us the world we live in. We are living in the Matrix.

We have basically nurtured the world to death. They built the pyramids to show us that we have forgotten more than we've ever learned. To show us you can not be a part of the universe if you literally start externalizing it from within, just so you can see it. Apparently there was a time on this planet in which we didn't live in houses, but we stayed warm dry and comfortable, we didn't farm food, but we were well fed. A time when the real magic of the universe was at our beckoning anytime we needed it, and just because we wanted to give it a name or write it down, we lost it. 



Please use a Bible search engine to search for words like good, burden, jaw, Jesus (the truth *and* the light), watchers (insider/outsiders), donkey, ass, clouds (shapeless forms that can go anywhere and caste a shade), Cain and Abel, left and right (especially these), turn (another good one), burden, and any other words you can think of that relate to this post. Please post what you find if you find it interesting or in apparent opposition, I welcome both.

I'm still working on all the Egyptian stuff, but it's where it all started. Imo, it's where the Bible was conceived of and written. Adam is merely Atum, and I'm still trying to figure out who Eve is, and Horus seems to be modern man. Then there's other things I don't even want to think about let alone mention- nothing bad, though.
