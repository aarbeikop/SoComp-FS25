"c2q9mb","environment","emotional","Stop Scaring Us. Teach Us.","I've spent a lot of my time as a 20 something-year-old terrified of my future, like most people my age. Every day we go onto the internet and see another article about Donald Trump creating some mess that could cause nuclear war or worsening climate change. We see corporations and other countries hiding their effects on the environment and continuing their same practices of destroying the planet. Like many other people my age, we have started to plan not to have kids, because we figure we may all die within the next hundred years. Even worse is the way media portrays our future to us as only death and destruction. We are terrified to get up in the morning because we think what the point is? What's the point of going to school, having jobs, starting families if we will all be gone soon? I have seen some many 20-year-olds panic and become depressed because they feel too helpless. All we are taught by the people we interact, and the media is that it is helpless.

I am done being afraid. Stop telling us that we are destined to die. Stop telling us that voting won't matter. Stop telling us that planting more trees or recycling more won't do anything. Stop. Seriously. Start telling us how to live and how we can help. Show us articles of positive change. Show us a positive progression. Show us what we can do to help. Most of us don't deny climate change, we just need to know how we can improve and that there is hope. If you keep telling us there is no hope and nothing can be done, we will panic and do nothing. Once the teenagers and 20-year-olds begin to believe they can do nothing, that's when we are really in trouble.

"c6lug9","environment","emotional","Direct action.","Dear all:

Most of us on this sub care about the environment except for a few brigadiers etc. 

A lot of us are vegetarian, a lot of us are vegan, a lot of us avoid palm oil, a lot of us save water, a lot of us do a lot. It is incredibly admirable and the right thing to do no question. 

How much of an impact this really has on the environment is minimal. If you live in a house (god forbid you have money) or rent an apartment, you’re “choosing” (consumer choices) to pay for something that has caused huge local and global damage. The cement, the glass, the electricity etc, are all things that go into the creation of a modern (western? Jk what a terrible word) home, that have high emissions.

Should you live on the street and not cause any damage? Yes. Is that feasible/ is anyone going to do it? No is the answer about 99.9% of the time. The less you have, the harder this is to be homeless. So what are we to do and who is at fault/causing our planet to die? 

Obviously you’re already aware but it’s the corporations and government. They hold the power to stop what they are doing. The only thing that prevents them from doing anything is their own greed. 

So what’s the solution to this? Direct action. There are forms like signing up CEO’s to hundreds of news letters or calling them over and over. All this will do is cause them to make a new email address and change their number. 

More has to be done, it is time to act. What is it that I’m suggesting? 

I can’t say. It’s against the reddit rules. Even what I said just above is theoretically against the rules (witch hunt type of stuff ya’kno, luckily I didn’t name names). 

What I can tell you/ suggest you my dear reader to do, is to learn more and read more about direct action. 

That’s my 2 cents, I’m sure you already know, but repetition is key. Help fight for the planet; protect her from greed by any means necessary.

Have a nice day!

Kind regards,

An anti-fascist","2019-06-28 15:53:17","8","2","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/c6lug9/direct_action/","True","oniobag1","1747929729.206133","our planet is dying","manual"
"c1zekj","collapse","skeptical","I've just rewatched WALL•E","I've just rewatched my favorite Pixar movie the other day, but the last time I saw it I wasn't as collapse aware as I'm now (nor subscribed to this sub).

Well, I don't know about you guys, but it started hitting some eerily familiar tones.


In the movie, around 2100 the whole world is being governed by an immense corporation called _BUYnLARGE_, which has basically extracted every resource and polluted the world as much as possible.

The massive overpopulation and waste management problems that ensued are the reason our fellow robot protagonist WALL•E came to be, as a massive army of them was deployed to compart the trash into cubes which then had to be incinerated (I guess they somehow tried but failed capturing all that CO2).

All the while, humanity was ""evacuated"" aboard immense spaceships while BnL scientists were busy cleaning and restoring the planet.


All of this left me with some seriously dark questions which are never answered, even though the movie smartly implies the horrors that lie in the answers:

First of all, what's not made clear is who got to get aboard the ships.
Because they were marketed as massively luxurious starliners, one can assume that all but the rich were left to die, starve and suffocate on the a dying planet.

A planet that got so irresponsibly salvaged that air became unbreathable and toxic, massive sand storms ravaged the land and all animal and plant species became extinct (in the movie the BnL CEO congratulates the captain when he discovers the _first sign of ongoing photosynthesis_ detected in YEARS!!).

It's probable that many oceans evaporated away or turned acidic/anoxic.

While at the surface I saw WALL•E as pretty similar to any other animated movies from Pixar, I'm finally beginning to see how it's _one of the most poignant and actually horrifically apocalyptic movies_ of the past decades.

The second part of the movie isn't any better, as you get to see how low has humanity fallen while living for 700 years oblivious of anything.

Leaving machines and robots in charge of everything resulted in homo sapiens evolving into a meat blob with most of its bones atrophied.

Questions about what these humans eat (liquefied food in a cup), and how they even reproduce (they can't even stay upright) can lead to many uncomfortable implications (it's probably a mix of eugenics and test tube birth process), but I won't delve too much into that.


Now don't get me wrong, I love the idea of humans returning to reclaim earth and fix what their ancestors had done.

The hope inducing images shown during the ending credits, with humanity terraforming and reintroducing plants and animals, give a much needed dose of warmth to an overall dark movie that is mainly about two adorable robots who fall in love with eachother. 

What strucks the most is the overall terrifying implication on how humanity has gotten to the sad state our protagonists see.
 
I absolutely love WALL•E even more after becoming aware of the inevitable collapse of our current socioeconomic system, and am thankful to the people who worked on the movie for having created such a thought provoking story.



P.S. Sorry about the wall of text.

"bxsi1c","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I feel like we're already living in a hellish dystopia","We produce shit, we buy this shit, we eat this shit, we throw this shit in the woods, etc...

Our planet is fucking dying and the only people that could make something about it aren't going to do anything because ""profits"" despite them already having a shiton of money.

We still continues to increase our plastic production, despite running out of materials to make it sooner.

People prefers to look at themselves before looking at the big picture. They are faking their lives.

Not saying I am the greatest person and everyone is wrong. I am, despite me not accepting this, making this big machine running, like everyone else. But it seems it's impossible to stop it now.

I feel powerless. I could do anything, but I'm just one person flooded in the big world. In order to stop our autodestruction we need a global move, but it won't happen. Ever. 

I feel like we're living in the most terrible dystopias of all dystopias that could exists.

"c0d601","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","A Ghost Story","This story is the entire truth from my heart. You can take it or call me crazy, it doesn't matter what you think of me. I know my own mistakes, learned from them, and tried to help people along this journey to search for myself.

If you know this handle, then you know exactly who I am, however I go by many names now. Too many to count.

This entire ""project"" simply started when I was a toddler, playing in a preschool environment. I met another toddler, who was female and we experimented sexual with eachother. However what was interesting and absolutely insane, was that somehow in some insane sense, we communicated on a ""Telepathic"" level. We exchanged what would become the start of this project, ""True Names"". Hers was the The Stag, and mine was The White Buffalo. Ironic considering we have been chasing eachother ever since.

After playing together in Preschool, we became extremely close, too close. Like family, however after preschool, I never saw her again, never new her ""Modern"" name. This began the true journey of looking for my other ""Half"" of my soul.

Considering how young I was, it make sense that I wouldn't remeber anything from this experience, as children grow older, their brains develop and expand. Along with the current education system, I was constantly barraged with new educational ideas and systems. Which hardly gave me the time to truly think who I had met that long ago.

Like anyone else in this world, school was tough for me, I had what some traditional individuals would call the ""Devils Tattoo"" which was really just a mixture of OCD, ADHD, and every other scientific ""Category"" you could label.

My only escape was music. So at a young age, I delved deep into music and its culture. In specific Eminem, and I believe I was around 8 years old, and literally I loved it so much, that I shit my pants in class. This is when I was cast out from literally everything that most ""Normal"" people had. The bullying started, even though it technically was a normal body function of a young boy going through puberty. I was called and labeled as ""Gay"" or in other terms Homosexual. But in reality I actually just loved his music, the way he twisted words helped me focus on my schoolwork.

By then the damage had already been done however. I was cast out by my classmates as ""Gay"" and my traditional religious family as listening to the ""Devil"". I literally had nothing, at the age of 8-10 years old besides music and video games. It was the only thing that kept me alive and happy. I focused on my schoolwork and listened to all kinds of music at this age instead of developing my social skills properly like you are supposed to.

It was around this time that my elder sister introduced me to the original Xbox and Halo Combat Evolved. I was absolutely obsessed. I played it constantly, even though at that age it was terrifying. Parasites called the ""Flood"" and religious fanatics called the ""Covenant"" and the only man, the only person who could stop them was Master Chief. A Spartan, trained from birth to be a warrior, orphaned, cloned, literally stolen from the world he would have known by the a secret government agency called ONI.

But playing this game made me wonder and become absolutely terrified for Humanity as a whole. Because what if the Flood came to earth now? Could we stop them? Even the UNSC, with way more advanced technology and government policies couldn't stop that monster. The Covenant, while religious fanatics and absolutely loyal to their ""Prophets"" would glass entire PLANETS just to cure this disease.

At this point, I was a 12 year old nerdy, geeky, kid who was told to play outside, imagine, dream big. But I was scared. Were aliens really there? I don't my parents to die. My friends. My family. Humanity.

To combat this, I made ""John"" or the real Spartan 117 into my alter Personality. My brother, and since my real name ""Shawn"" means ""John"" in Hebrew, it was a good fit. This Ghost of mine followed me everywhere. My own world, where I could be free, and save Humanity.

By 14 my Father wanted my help with the family buisness pouring and finishing concrete. This was a great experience for me, I'd work in the summers, earn alittle extra money for Warhammer, games, and toys. But Construction is a Man's job, not a teenager's. I had to grow up quick to match the other employees, constantly making mistakes and being taught how to properly do the job. If there was a big project, I'd skip school to help my family put food on the table and I was satisfied with that. I worked with my Father and learned a niche skillset and mindset which I will always treasure.

Because of the advance in video games and the culture behind it, I became obsessed again with the Military, Police, EMS, etc. They were my heroes, real life, breathing, dangerous Men who helped other people find freedom themselves. I admired them deeply, regardless of Nation or Race. Because, they truly are modern heroes.

But I was confused, why was Humanity killing eachother? Why couldn't we realize that there are bigger threats out there? Like ALIENS! How many more millions of lives must we spend fighting eachother over Religon, Race, Language, Sex, Money, Technology, before we realize that we are all just Humans. Each on our own Great Journey in life.

And this is when the project started. In Highschool, I had a group of brothers. True family, who I told them I would die for them if I had too. We made a Covenant or Vow, that in this world or the next, we would find eachother again. Regardless of what happened. For that, I am truly grateful, we shed blood, sweat, and tears on the battlefield of our local Highschools Canadian Football Field. Together we were Warriors.

I began to get into the drug scene with my brothers. At this point, it was more a ""Gang"" than a Football team. Weapons, drugs, women, the whole deal. We ruined lives. And I ruined mine because I delved too deep into myself. 

I spent 2 weeks without sleep, doing almost any drug I could get my hands on. MDMA, Speed, Weed, Shrooms, Ecstasy, Alchohol, Tobacco. But as we learn in life, every action has a consequence. I went mentally insane, causing irreparable damage to my body and brain. I lost all of my memories.

I then was admitted to the local mental hospital and stayed in an Isolation room for 2 weeks, completely, utterly insane, and the worst thing was I couldn't trust who I was or used to be anymore.

After detoxing, I spent a month on ward, hallucinating and hearing voices constantly. Some good, but most were dangerous and very angry ideas. After being released I went to Rehab in the states to get away from the whole situation. Burned every bridge I had so that I could recreate myself again. The family I made at the Academy where I stayed are and always will be some of my closest friends. We had great memories together, some werid, but amazingly, somehow, we were still alive.

After Rehab, I went back home to Canada to work. I continued working up until now on and off. A normal day was at least 16-20 hours a day, getting 4 hours of sleep, 5-6 days a week, for at least 5 months a year. I made good money, enough that I could travel around the world and meet tons of interesting people, and do amazing things with them. Exchange stories about our trips and lives to help eachother through our journeys alone.

Last year I visited Japan, and I always wanted to go there since I was around 5 or years old. It was a dream of mine. It was the best decision of my life, I learned so much from such a great and honorable country. I met many different types of people, young, old, successful, struggling, businessman, student, family man, Yakuza, it didnt matter, I loved every second of it. The way they lived inspired me to challenge EVERYTHING I knew so far about myself. So this began my next journey.

I went back home, depressed, back to my grueling and painful employment. Playing video games instead of being physically social with people to save money for something, but I never knew what. I liked to be open, without plans, experience LIFE without a concrete plan in place constantly.

As any Buddhist or hell, any SPIRITUAL person knows. Fuck even scientists, know that opposites attract eachother. So I somehow managed to meet my 2nd Ghost online. I was being Cyber Stalked without realizing it at all. Literally my ideas being stolen from me by hackers. And honestly, I'd blame it on my own stupidity and just lack of giving a fuck about the world. So my entire life has basically been sold on the internet. 😂

However, as of yesterday, I killed both of my Ghosts. But it cost everything. Every connection I made, every friendship, my family, my relationships, my ideas, my health mentally and physically.

Everything.

But it was my Great Journey, and no one in the entire world can take that from me. I know who I am, I remeber everything. I'd tell more stories, but I think some secrets are better left behind closed doors. Opening Pandora's box is not my intention and never has been. This was just another story, another journey of a young boy growing to become a Man. 

If there's one simple piece of advice I could give:

Monsters are everywhere, but the one you should fear the most, is the Demon inside of yourself. If you let it take control, it will destroy everything you love. Never forget your Traditions and where you come from. But most importantly, you are HUMAN. Invent, build, create, develop, design, it doesn't matter. Just do something, everyday, even if hurts every cell in you.

Just LIVE. That is the purpose of LIFE.

Also aliens are real. But the Wolves are on the prowl. Some work in teams, others prefer to be alone. But the ones who have always had a Ghost with them. Those are the most dangerous ones, violent, volatile, sporadic, they show their scars, but most importantly;

They are HEADHUNTERS

Cheers to the Men and Women who got me this far in my life. You know exactly who you are. Take care of yourselves, I'll see you around.
