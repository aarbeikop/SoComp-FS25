A letter to my parents (and many other parents of millennial children)

Throughout the world, the alarm bells that have been ringing for well over a decade now are finally starting to be heard. Freak weather events, record breaking heatwaves and highest temperatures year after year, distinct absences of frosty mornings in the winter, periods of drought and then weeks of heavy rain. Angry young people are telling politicians to sit down, shut up and listen, taking to the street with placards essentially begging for a shot at their future, before its robbed from us and generations to come. 

I don’t know how to persuade the complacent older generation who convivially laugh about how they’ll be dead before it’s a real problem for them - but Mum, Dad, I won’t be. I will be very much alive and so will (god willing) your grandchildren. You raised me to be successful, the scientist that I am. I have had the benefit of higher education that you have not so perhaps I have had the (mis)fortune of having these issues thrust in my face to analyse, to critique, to evidence and find solutions for. I can assure you now that you will not be dead before it’s an issue, because it’s an issue now. At the predicted pinnacle of all this climate chaos, in 2100, your grandchildren will be alive and fighting to stay cool, fighting for clean drinking water and adequate food, fighting for space and resources with millions of climate refugees who will be leaving equatorial areas in the next few decades. I do not want to hear that it is not your problem any more, because I am your daughter and it is my problem, and therefore yours.

Do you know that I am considering not having children at all? Since my late teens I dreamed of having a family, having children and raising them to be good and kind. But raising my children right may be the least of my concerns if I must arm them with the skills and wherewithal to cope with a planet that is slowly dying. You can have them during school holidays and feed them ice cream and take them to nice places, but when you hand them back to me, I must ensure that their future is secure for them seeing as ‘you’ll be dead’, so who cares. I must ensure that when I die, they are savvy enough to cope, they are tenacious enough to fight for resources. What if I must raise my children to live selfishly to ensure their survival? What if I everything I endeavour to preach, to be kind, to be generous, I have to double back on and preach instead to be cut-throat and vicious? I am not sure I can truly justify bringing new lives into this planet to condemn them to a life of suffering and fighting.

You may think me over dramatic but remember how proud you were when I graduated with my first degree and then my Masters. I have armed myself with analytical skills, I have privileged access to reams of scientific evidence that supports that modern climate change is perpetuated by human activity. Despite there being accessible evidence for the general public freely available, I know you won’t look for it or read it or take it seriously. But believe *me*. Trust *me*. Trust that I am not making this up, I am not being over-dramatic. Believe that I am scared and that you should be too. For my sake and the sake of your grandchildren. 

I would imagine from my (fortunately) limited understanding that coming to realise what trouble the planet is really in is like being diagnosed with cancer. Sat across from a professional who knows better than you, who is trained in these things and highly qualified, telling you that, potentially, you’re absolutely fucked. But. If you start treatment and you start it NOW, there is a chance that you can kick its ass after a bit of time, though you won’t be the same after. Your family won’t be the same. You will go forward in life from now on carefully considering your diet, your level of activity, the products you put on your body and clean your home with. I can imagine that it’s a shock to the system, to look at your life and realise the magnitude of change you must undertake. Knowing that it isn’t just down to you, it’s down to everyone. Your colleagues, your neighbours, your family, your friends, the server who brought you your food, the men who collect your rubbish, the newsreaders on the TV, that comedian you laugh at. What are they doing? What’s the point if they’re not doing a thing either? They’re ignoring this cancer - surely it’ll go away if we just change to energy-saving light bulbs and make sure the tap isn’t running while we brush our teeth... 

I guarantee you if you start making a change tomorrow, someone will see that and think – shit. If you’re doing something, maybe I should too. Maybe this is serious. After all, your daughter is a scientist, she’d know. And Mum, Dad, you should know. This isn’t a secret. This isn’t new. This is real. You might both be sun worshippers and be enjoying this ‘global warming lark’, but it isn’t to be laughed at. It is time to sit down, shut up and listen.","2019-07-02 10:47:08","15","6","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/c87ri2/a_letter_to_my_parents/","True","concerned_overlywarm","1747931412.956092","our planet is dying","manual"

Humans and livestock caused 80% of species extinction during the Holocene, most of it in the last 60 years.

http://www.futureearth.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_blog_image/public/articles/great-acceleration.jpg?itok=-11Nrb2U

The oceans are acidifying 10X faster than in all earth's history, and when they reach a ""critical threshold"", ocean acidification will explode 100X faster than now, killing all sea shell creatures in its wake. These micro-shelled creatures form the basis for food on earth. Life on land depends on life in the ocean. Ocean acidification makes it harder for phytoplankton to absorb nutrients. We need phytoplankton to breathe.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/carbon-threshold-mass-extinction-0708

http://www.planetexperts.com/ocean-acidification-toxifying-phytoplankton/

Micro-plastics in the ocean are killing the plankton that produce 10% of earth's oxygen.

https://futurism.com/the-byte/plastic-killing-bacteria-oxygen

And that's just the oceans. On land we have destroyed 98% of the mega-fauna on earth and replaced them with cows. There are 25 billion chickens on earth.

Germany's green energy miracle is so completely fraudulent as to defy description. Here's just one example: They burn over 60% of their recycling refuse. They lie about car emissions. Their forests are dying, and they're moving whole villages to get at some the dirtiest coal in the world.

The Insurance Journal recently said we have to cut emissions 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 3° C by 2100. Claire Fyson of Climate Analytics says the same thing. Stefan Rahmstorf says we have to cut emissions 100% in 20 years to avoid 2° C.

Here's the problem, 2° C on earth is the equivalent of the critical threshold danger for our oceans. Hitting 2° C will trigger five major feedbacks, which will trigger 8 other major feedbacks, leading to runaway mass extinction and runaway hothouse climate catastrophe. 

Here's the really, really bad news: even if we managed to increase our carbon budget 50%, we would only gain 10 years to cut emissions. But there's a flip side to this because arctic methane emissions are not modelled, and will likely cut our carbon budget by up to 50%, meaning we will have 10 years less to cut emissions. Arctic methane from sub-sea clathrate and tundra thermaklasts will combine with unreported human methane emissions and sink the boat

But it gets worse still, because we are slamming headlong into runaway mass extinction *ahead* of runaway hothouse climate change. Both runaway hothouse earth and runaway mass extinction cannot be stopped or reversed once they tip past that critical threshold. There's no guarantee earth will recover. But it gets worse.

We have to cut emissions 50% in 10 years to save the planet, otherwise ocean acidification will go into overdrive and reach mass extinction escape velocity, but China will not even begin to **significantly** reduce emissions until 2030 at the earliest. But it gets worse. Emissions have to go down **significantly** now, not 10 years from now. China has recently cut solar production 40%.

**If the IT sector were a country, it would rank 3rd in energy use, after China and the USA**

The 4 main sub-sectors to IT are: 1. devices 2. networks 3. data centers 4. manufacturing.

Data Centers: Used 21% of total IT energy use in 2017.

- Google uses 16 data centers to run 40,000 searches/second.

- Data centers used 320 Terra Watt Hours (TWHs) of energy/yr in 2012.

- 320 TWHs of data center energy use was 2% of total energy use in 2012.

- Streaming video is projected to increase data center energy use from 2% up to 13% of total energy use.

Networks: Used 29% of total IT energy use in 2017.

- Network energy use increased from 219 TWHs, in 2007, to 354 TWHs in 2012.

- 354 TWHs could power 32 million US homes for 1 year.

- Network energy use is growing 10% / yr.

- Steaming will grow to 80% of internet traffic by 2020.

**The Potsdam Institute on the IPCC Special Report:**

https://youtu.be/poHNsxbgHig

To stay below 1.5 C we have to cut emissions 100% by 2050.

To stay below 1.5 C we can only emit 420 gtons C02 total.

Even if we managed to change the 420 gton budget by 50% up, or by 50% down, we only get 10 years more, or 10 years less time to cut emissions 100%.

If methane emissions increase enough to  shrink our carbon budget to 220 gtons, then we have to cut emissions 100% by 2040 they say.

Mass extinction not included.

I think this means if we don't cut emissions 50% in 10 years, we'll never make it. 

Emissions will go up between 10-15% in the next 10 years.

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% in your lifetime. 

If you are 30 years old, emissions went up 60% in your lifetime. 

After 30 years trying, solar and wind are < 3% of total world energy use. 

Just think of the last 10 years. since 2009, emissions went up some 15%.

Can you take 10 more years of the same old bullshit, I know I can't.","2019-07-23 10:45:29","12","1","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/cgr0m0/runaway_mass_extinction_runaway_ocean/","True","CommonEmployment","1747931430.235923","our planet is dying","manual"
"ch6p6v","environment","emotional","Value of Water","  
How water gives meaning to life  
A thirsty thought understands the need for water, when we are born, all we know is to drink water, let the water flow through our eyes, in the form of tears. Tears are a medium to represent our life’s most exciting moments, be it joy and happiness, or love and sorrow. Starting from having a bath in a tiny tub of our size, to our luxurious showers, we haven’t learned the fact that with our current approach we will either sink in it or will die looking for it. Science may have taught us the life cycle of condensation and evaporation but didn’t teach us how to ride that cycle, how to have a piggy bank for it and keep it in our basket. H20, is just a formula for water, for us now. Cape Town is in the unenviable situation of being the first major city in the modern era to face the threat of running out of drinking water and all major cities are sooner or later will join the quest to doom 

  
Have you ever kissed the droplets of dew, and try not to drink it?   
It is said that one should drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, to be healthy and fit. But have you ever wondered the thirst and need of our mother earth for pure water to accommodate all of its children per day? Per week and month?? And so on! We used to get punishments in school when we didn’t do our homework right? Exactly, the same situation is right now. We forget to do our homework, to water the plant, to see it grow. Where is the excitement? To water, the plant is to nourish our mother nature. In return of doing nothing, natural disasters are the punishment, not for just us, but to other innocents too on our behalf. Imagine a world, where we get an instant return for what we do. Forex. We plant a tree; we get the fruit the other day. We water a plant; it rains at the same moment. It would have been a blessing, right? So, patience is what, we are losing. Being a mother is a feeling, which everyone says only a mother can understand. But I say when you plant a tree, and water it daily, watch it grow, who will the most hurt person, to watch it die one day? The love for nature has no birth and expiry date. It's free, it’s an elixir for life. When our eyelash falls on our cheeks, the first thing we do is take it carefully on our hand, close our eyes and make a wish. And blow it in air, but have we ever thought what if our wish stays with us, and lashes got just carried away by the wind, what if the receiver never receives the message? The same way a lot of people are wishing for a healthy planet, silently and it’s our turn to open our eyes and let it happen. Imagine a home of fish, or a crocodile or a turtle, they are nearly homeless these days,   
In textbooks, we came across to “water water everywhere, nor a drop to drink”; isn’t it’s becoming true?   
Okay now let me take you back to the time when elites had the giant pools, and queens had the most luxurious bath of the time; and when their gardens were flourished, their ponds were full of fishes and many more. You might have a question now; when they never thought of saving water, then why should we?? The answer lies in the stories itself, what they took from nature, they returned it in an acceptable form to it, and what we are doing is, we want the purest form of water, use it, spoil it, make money, and never care where does that water go.

"cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","It is unfair. We will all die unhappy because 95% of the population is not aware of the collapse.","Inspired by this beautiful [topic by /u/Sabina090705]( https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ceum0y/i_flaired_this_post_coping_because_to_me_its_not/) I decided to pitch in my 2 cents.

I do not live in the United States, I am 10 years younger than the above user (30 yo vs 40yo) and I am afraid. But not afraid of the collapse, or of an authoritarian US or of the ongoing destruction of the planet. I am scared by the simple fact of being unhappy until death comes for me. My whole life I was a pessimist, you know, the typical dude “better be safe than sorry” or “it’s better to be prepared for the worse and be happy when it turns out well”, but never was I so afraid. 

I come from an academic family that is very politic-centric, watches the news and reads whitepapers constantly. In the last 10 years, I finished 3 master degrees, learned 3 foreign languages and started a family. In comparison, you may say I’m well off, no debt, no illness and a pretty nice “social parachute”. But that’s all lies. Lies told by politicians how well we have, how we should be grateful and enjoy the meme/movies/eating out. How we will enjoy our retirement. But I know that we current state of affairs, everything I do, like savings, being a responsible buyer will be useless in 10 years. To be honest, the grey mass of uneducated/carpe diem people that live by maxing CC will be far better than I am. At least they are enjoying themselves now and I in the meantime I’m worrying for the future.

> First small digression: I lived in Poland for quite some time. The current polish govt is pro-nationalist, is destroying the rule of law left and right, is pro-catholic, doesn't care about the environment and is buying votes by having a ""great"" social plan. Just to show you how Poland is fucked, almost 50% of citizens between 18 and 65 are not working, there's 4M of Ukrainian migrants in Poland and with an average salary of 3000 PLN net (around 800 EUR) the govt. decides to give 500 PLN per child every month. [My gilded comment about the current situation in Poland](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cb3yfo/poland_to_eliminate_income_tax_for_all_workers/etdpac7/). How do you sustain such a country when 100% of your powergrid is dependent on Russian Oil and  on the import of power from Germany and Sweden? You just can't. There's no plan to build any wind farm, solar panel farm or nuclear plant. And for some amazing reason, the housing market in Poland exploded (it's impossible to buy a flat) and every one is somehow ""living the dream"".

When I still had friends, I tried to talk to them about climate changes. That half of all the CO2 emissions were done post 1990, that rising temperature will have a cascading effect on all the power plants and blackouts will be frequent. The equator belt will be hit by such a heat waves and a wetbulb event that the ensuing African, Indian or S.Am. migration will be the downfall of the US and EU. Already when traveling in Greece, Italy, France or Germany you see plenty of Africans in the streets not working and just “being there”. Now imagine this coupled with a blackout, water crisis and crop destruction. It is an apocalypse. 

> Second Small digression, Referring to the above post in the first paragraph – I totally agree that closing and guarding the border is not a solution. The isolationism coupled with nationalism policy never worked and always sparked devastating wars. But accepting everyone is also not wise, we should be helping the migrants by having a plan.

Anyway, there are not enough resources to build all the renewable electric powerplants and grid to sustain the current energy needs of the world. Moreover, China, India, and all the developing countries won’t be so eager to implement western ecological rules. Drinking water shortages will be a daily occurrence, revolts and rebellions will happen every day. Do you see what’s going on in France? They have a weekly yellow vest protest for the last 6 months just because Macron wanted to RAISE THE TAX ON FUEL. I mean… sometimes I fell like living in on another planet (third disgression: [How many liters of fuel can you buy with the average salary](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8pc94k/how_many_liters_of_diesel_can_be_purchased_with/) France: 1457 liters, Poland: 699. And the French have the audacity to protest? Why Poland is not up in flames?). And I won’t even mention the epidemics, the rising sea levels, Russia trying to meddle into every country and create chaos [my gilded comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cbja9x/some_of_putins_top_cops_are_mobsters_even_kgb/etgcv3l/), the wars sparked by the lack of resources (read about the Indus river threaty and how it will impact Pakistan if India decides to reroute the river. Or about Sudan and Egypt) and the automation that will take our jobs. The capitalist overlords are just waiting for automation to be able to show better quarterly revenues to their shareholders. [John Oliver on Automation](https://youtu.be/_h1ooyyFkF0). About 8M of bread earners in the US will lose their jobs in the next few years. 3M truck drivers, 3M working in retail, 1M working in warehouses, 1M of office admin. That's 8M*4 (a typical family of 4)= 32M without anything to eat. That's almost 10% of the US. [Income inequality Vox video on 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xa9T2OMzmw) and [Curiositystream wealth inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caBDPFx2et4)

On another note, my grandparents were Polish (Bless their souls), they witnessed WWII first hand. I can still hear the stories they would tell me when I was younger. Of the time when my grandma as a little girl had to run in a field with her whole village because the Stuka’s where strafing it. And then a year or two later, to hide in barns because Russians were raping whole villages. Or of my grandpa fighting in the Warsaw uprising on ’44 as a young boy. War is terrible and war brings the worst in us. That’s why, our grandparents, when they came home from this war or the following ones, were not preoccupied with the climate change. They wanted the best for them and their children by building a home, having a car, being able to travel. We can all understand it somehow that the terrors of war were so profound that CO2 – something you can’t even see – was not on their priority list. 

But when the Boomers went on a crazy spending spree they left us with nothing. The minimum wage in the US should be 4x higher to match the minimum wage of ’60. It is harder and harder to find work because of automation. The population of every country is getting older and older and fewer kids are born. [My post about economiccollapse]( https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/ceenp0/something_to_think_about_the_current_state_of/)

And my hard to swallow pill is the fact that everyone around me is happy and I’m not. Just because I know 10x more than them I will die unhappy and afraid. They live their life, they post on Instagram pictures from Tokyo or Maldives, they are building houses, buying new cars and spending, spending, spending. Some of them will watch and repost a Vox or Vice video about climate change and that’s it. It is far more important for them to watch the latest Stranger thing or to badmouth a colleague at work to get a promotion. I don't have a car, nor a house, nor spending thousands on holidays. I try to live responsibly but I see it is pointless.

We are living in a dystopia where the whole society is telling us “work, save, and at the ripe age of 65, you will retire and travel the world” or “Study STEM, work a lot and retire early at the age of 40 or 45”. But what if you won’t make it even until 45? What if there will be such a strong recession or war that everything you saved during your lifetime will be erased? What's the point of working or trying to be a better human or trying to learn a new craft if everything is pointless.

Please, I really would like to bank on the fact that I know (knowledge is power, isn't it?) what’s happening. How to make enough money now to be still able to enjoy the last years that we have on this earth? I would hate to die in a couple of years knowing that all my /dumb/ friends enjoyed life. I was the one saving but in the end we all died thanks to them and their peers spending.

PS: the sad part is that the general population is more and more “woke”, r/worldnews is almost a copy of r/collapse. More and more people are being conscious of what’s happening, but they are still hopeful that we can change the direction we are heading. If more people are conscious then the collapse will happen sooner than later. More people will start panicking, sparkling rebellions and revolutions. So the collapse maybe sooner than we think.

I think this means if we don't cut emissions 50% in 10 years, we'll never make it. Emissions will go up between 10-15% in the next 10 years.

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% in your lifetime. 

If you are 30 years old, emissions went up 60% in your lifetime. 

After 30 years trying, solar and wind are < 3% of total world energy use. 

Just think of the last 10 years. since 2009, emissions went up some 15%.

Can you take 10 more years of the same old bullshit, I know I can't.

"ceum0y","collapse","skeptical","I ""Flaired"" this Post ""Coping"" Because to Me, It's Not Political, It's Simply Human - I AM SCARED FOR ALL OF US...","I'm so worried for where we are headed. I worry about what we're about to witness, what we're already seeing. We are facing collapse. Many in developing countries are already in the thick of it. Many of those people are coming to where we are (developed nations) to seek refuge. Developed countries everywhere are truly surrounded by a collapsing world, now. We all knew this day was coming.

&#x200B;

People knew it would happen decades ago and chose to do NOTHING about it. They kept on driving their Escalades and their Suburbans, living in homes 3 times bigger than was necessary, keeping their lights on, turning their AC down to 68 instead of 72, flying yearly - monthly - weekly for business and for pleasure, buying the biggest TVs, tucking their children safely in their warm beds, and falling asleep watching Johnny Carson - while the coal burned and the planet got hotter. They knew they were doing. They what was coming and didn't care. So here we are.

&#x200B;

I get that it's scary. I understand nationalism increases in times of uncertainty, because it's scary. But it's not the refugees that scare me. It's not even the changing climate that scares me so much. It's people's reactions to these things that's the most terrifying to me.

&#x200B;

Forgive me, but I was raised by a different generation. My mother couldn't care for me, so I was adopted by my grandparents - and they were OLD - even for grandparents. I was born in 79', my grandmother in 28' and my grandfather in 1906. I was raised by people who were generations removed from me and they taught me a lot. They lived through the depression, my grandfather remembered the Titanic sinking and WW1. My grandmother worked in a parachute factory during WW2 as a teenager as her 3 older brothers went off to fight the Reich in Europe. One of them never came home.

&#x200B;

They saw what nationalism does. They saw what scapegoating does. They saw and taught me what it leads to. Germany was going through terrible economic hardship before the rise of the Reich. What we're facing is more than economic hardship, we're facing total catastrophe; a climate that is beginning to batter humanity and will ultimately take our economies, our comfort, our food, our water, and likely, many of our lives with it. That is truly scary. However, the path of least resistance - enclosing ourselves in a bubble in the developed world to keep out anyone not ""like us"" - is NOT going to stop it.

&#x200B;

My grandparents instilled such a sense of caution against the attitudes I'm seeing and hearing it's, quite literally, visceral for me. I see hundreds of exhausted, hungry, sweaty, unbathed men forced together into cages and it chills me to my bones. I see whole families, with children, smashed into concrete rooms so tightly that faces are pressed against the glass windows, in the United States, the country my grandmother's brother died to protect from such atrocities, and I am haunted. I hear my grandmother sobbing in my ear, her voice echoing from a past that she warned me to always be vigilant against its ever being repeated. I hear people saying things like ""Build a wall and put men with guns on it"" or ""Shoot before they can cross"" - not once in a while, but constantly, everywhere, and I am physically sickened by it. And then I realize, this is just the beginning. The refugees will keep coming and their numbers will keep growing - and I am overcome with fear and apprehension, not of the refugees, but of what we will do to them when it becomes too much.

&#x200B;

How are these inhumane attitudes and reactions going to help us? Do we think we're immune from the changing climate, the food scarcities, the water depletion? We're not. It's coming for us too whether we act with compassion or with barbarism - it's still coming for us. Given the opportunity, I would take a Guatemalan family who walked 1000+ miles to save their family from starvation as my neighbor, a thousand times over when that day comes, over some old white guy who's spent the last 30 years in a recliner, lamenting about ""the foreigners"" and ""illegals"" and begging for a wall.

&#x200B;

If this attitude isn't stopped, if it continues to spread, we will bear witness to unimaginable atrocities as this unfolds - like it or not, that's reality. Those atrocities won't protect us, but they will ensure that when our turn comes - AND IT WILL - not only will we have the suffering of collapse to contend with, but the suffering of our hearts, minds, and souls as well.

&#x200B;

Please forgive me, I couldn't keep standing by and not saying anything. I can't stand by as this unconscionable ideology continues to spread like a cancer, anymore, and stay silent. It's not normal, it's not political, it is hate - it is evil - it is dangerous - it leads to the worst kinds of acts against humanity itself. I just can't. Peace!

"cdi2xx","Conservative","unknown","Likening US-MEX border conditions to ""concentration camps"" is a form of Holocaust denial and should receive a swift, bipartisan condemnation.","r/unpopularopinion wouldn't allow this post, so I thought it would fit here. While it's not necessarily a conservative viewpoint, the Republican Party more closely aligns with the following post. 

Using my backup account for this one (yet again) because of the inherent controversy this topic area generates.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In this post, I'll be offering a new angle into this common debate. Not only is likening US-MEX border conditions to concentration camps wrong, I contend, but it's also a form of Holocaust denial. Please note that I am **NOT** stating that the people in question believe the Holocaust never happened; rather, they're conclusively disregarding historical suffering (an inadvertent form of denial).

&#x200B;

Let's start with a quick overview.

&#x200B;

**Background Information**

On June 24 of 2019, the [United States Holocaust Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/press-releases/why-holocaust-analogies-are-dangerous) released a strongly-worded statement ""unequivocally rejecting"" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's analogy where she likened border conditions to Nazi concentration camps.  Calling her statement an ""oversimplified approach,"" the museum cautioned against understating the atrocities present in Germany at the time. They received substantial blowback from several angles, including some [Holocaust historians themselves.](https://www.newsweek.com/holocaust-genocide-experts-defend-ocascio-cortez-concentration-camp-1446911)

I'm looking to defend the following statement in particular:

>As the Holocaust recedes in time, some Americans (and Europeans) are becoming **increasingly casual and disrespectful to the mass murder of millions**. More dangerous, today the internet disseminates insensitive or hateful remarks with unprecedented ease and influence.

My rationale for this being an unpopular opinion stems from media representation. Since the museum's statement, several reputable sources (e.g Washington Post, NYT, etc.) have published articles dissecting the ""concentration camp"" semantic debate. A majority of them, such as articles like [these,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/opinion/sunday/migrant-kids-concentration-camps.html) mostly infer the same general conclusion: US-MEX border conditions are tantamount, or at least comparable, to Nazi concentration camps.

This is not only a *stunningly* incorrect conclusion, but it's also a form of holocaust denial. Here's why.

&#x200B;

**Quantitative Argument**

In the museum's letter, they refer primarily to the magnitude of the German atrocities. I attempt to capture this through numbers: while nothing can quantitatively encapsulate the suffering at the time, casualties at least offer a certain measure. Here's an excerpt from the Museum's statement of which I base this section:

>This oversimplified approach to complex history is dangerous. When conducted with integrity and rigor, the study of history raises more questions than answers. And as the most extensively documented crime the world has ever seen, the Holocaust offers an **unmatched** case study in how societies fall apart, in the immutability of human nature, in the dangers of unchecked state power.

&#x200B;

We'll begin with some simple numbers (sources included):

**Deaths.** According to multiple left-leaning sources, [**24 individuals** have perished](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/3k3jd3/the-trump-administration-has-let-24-people-die-in-ice-custody) in ICE custody since Trump's inauguration. Over 50,000 are detained on any given day. In Nazi concentration camps, [**eleven million people**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/holocaust-non-jewish-victims_n_6555604) died, including six million of Jewish descent. Historians note that the victims encompassed ""gay people, priests, gypsies, people with mental or physical disabilities, and communists,"" underpinning a ruthless and authoritarian extermination of *any* non-aligning political individual. In total, **458,000x more people died in Nazi concentration camps than in ICE custody.**

&#x200B;

Let's put these numbers into context:

* Assuming an average age of 35.2 years old (German average age in 1950) for each Holocaust victim, and an optimal life expectancy of seventy years, the Holocaust costed \~**385,000,000 years of human life** (*only* accounting for the deceased). ICE detainees have lost **just 840 years** by the same calculation.
* The number of deaths would've been enough to **wipe out the** ***entire*** **2019 population of Portugal** (\~10.5mil). Using the upper estimate of 20mil detained, the Nazis captured a population **equivalent to modern-day Somalia and The Congo,** ***combined.***
* The amount of people (24) who have perished in ICE custody is **0.02% of the population of Nauru**, the smallest UN-recognized island nation on the planet. Conversely, Nazi deaths amount to **98,500%**.

&#x200B;

I realize that deaths are an imperfect metric for quantifying human suffering, inhumane conditions, and immorality. But I believe, as would any reasonable, objective person, that the sheer difference here renders such inaccuracies inconsequential. Based on these numbers, then, I see no reasonable conclusion other than to concur with the following statement:

>As the Holocaust recedes in time, some Americans (and Europeans) are becoming increasingly casual and disrespectful to the mass murder of millions.

I'd add, though, that it's not only ""casual and disrespectful,"" but an act of denial outright. This comparison fundamentally overemphasizes the current situation at the expense of the historical one. That lessens and, in a way, delegitimatizes the suffering of the Holocaust.

&#x200B;

**Qualitative Argument**

I realize that humans are emotional creatures. Some of us are predispositioned to trust our emotions over stale numbers, and I haven't much of an issue with that. It's important, therefore, to inject an emotional context through text, images, and historical documents. This section contains selected excerpts from Dawid Sierakowiak (of the Lodiz Camp), interned for four years, contrasted against media accounts of the US-MEX border.

&#x200B;

HOLOCAUST

>**There are no vegetables** in the June ration, not even potatoes... death is striking left and right. A person becomes thin (an “hourglass”) and pale in the face, then comes the swelling, a few days in bed or in the hospital, and that’s it. The person was living the person is dead; **we live and die like cattle.** [*Lodiz Camp, May 26 of 1942.*](http://echoesandreflections.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/EchoesAndReflections_Lesson_Four_PrimarySource-ExcerptsfromTheDiaryofDawidSierakowiak.pdf)

&#x200B;

US-MEX BORDER

>Breakfasts consist mostly of cereal bars, lunches of ramen noodles or bologna sandwiches and dinners of microwaveable burritos and chimichangas. Some healthier items, like oatmeal, applesauce and peanut butter, are also listed \[but in smaller quantities\]. [*Bloomberg: June 28 of 2019.*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/slimy-sandwiches-unhealthy-ramen-on-appalling-detainee-menu)

To place this into simpler terms: US-MEX detainees eat two to three meals a day, usually consisting of ""unhealthy and slimy"" foodstuffs. These include microwavable burritos, ramen, and cereal bars, or mainly ""convenience foods that are cheap and easy."" Conversely, those in Nazi concentration camps were so malnourished that they turned ""thin (an 'hourglass') and pale in the face,"" then ""that's it."" This stark and undeniable contrast demonstrates the severely misguided, careless reality of likening US-MEX conditions to concentration camps.

&#x200B;

HOLOCAUST

>My state of mind is worsening every day. The fever persists, and I look like a complete 'death notice.' I can’t bring my irritated skin back to normal, either... **TB is spreading unbelievably**, and there is a great number of other infectious and noninfectious diseases. If things continue like this, **I will go crazy. Oh, this horrible, endless hopelessness. No chance or hope for life.** *Lodiz Camp, April 4 of 1943.*

&#x200B;

US-MEX BORDER

>VP saw 384 men sleeping inside fences, on concrete w\[ith\] no pillows or mats. They said they hadn’t showered in weeks, wanted toothbrushes, food. Stench was overwhelming. \[Customs and Border Protection\] said they were fed regularly, could brush daily \[and\] recently got access to shower. [*The Guardian: July 14 of 2019.*](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/14/trump-migrant-detention-center-pence-visit)

One of the main points of contention regarding the ICE detainment centers is hygiene. While the conditions at the border are certainly unhygienic - ""hadn't showered for 10-20 days"" - there's no apt comparison to Nazi internment camps. Indeed, Sierakowiak noted that infectious diseases were ""spreading unbelievably,"" leading to a perceptible paranoia and hopelessness. Simply put, the conditions at Nazi concentration camps wrought *immense* physical and psychological turmoil, evinced by the author's descent into madness. There have been no such accounts, nor anything even close, at the US-MEX border.

&#x200B;

I'll leave you with Sierakowiak's final surviving entry:

>…I am completely sick, and I have a high fever. I bought a Bayer medication for the flu, fever, and cold, for Nadzia and me. Nadzia stays in bed, and I think she will remain there for another day or two.  
>  
>Again, out of impatience I feel myself beginning to fall into melancholy. **There is really no way out of this for us**.  
>  
>*\[Editor:\] Here the last of Dawid Sierakowiak’s surviving notebooks breaks off. He died four months later of tuberculosis, starvation, and exhaustion, the syndrome known as “ghetto disease.”*

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I have tried to avoid the common arguments in this partisan debate. This include the ""they came here willingly"" point, an admittedly questionable exclusion in a piece centered around concentration camps. However, I believe that I have  demonstrated a deep, unquestionable divide between  conditions at the US-MEX border and at Nazi concentration camps through both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. This divide is so big, I feel, that likening the two inherently demeans the suffering of Nazi internees, substantially enough that it's an inadvertent act of denial.

&#x200B;

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is steadfast in calling US-MEX centers ""concentration camps."" Due to the reasons outlined both in the conclusion and throughout the post, she and supporters of the statement ought to receive swift and bipartisan condemnation. Otherwise, we oversimplify, diminish, and deny a harrowing historical event, which impacts not only the victim's families, but also our perception of history.

"ce7vue","conspiracy","unknown","The Saturn Time Cube (MEGATHREAD)","I know this is all I talk about, but every time I make a post about this subject, people ask for more information on it. I think it’s been almost two years since I wrote the first thread on this, so an updated version of this work is probably long overdue. However, the main point of this thread is to give some background information for an even crazier conspiracy which I will link at the end. Anyways, this is the **Saturn Time Cube**.

All over the world, across different cultures and religions, and throughout different films, literature, and other media, there is a consistent theme present that I am somewhat obsessed with. The theme I am referring to here is the black cube.

The black cube is a part of Jewish, Muslim, and Masonic tradition. It can be seen in places like the UN meditation room, Mecca, the 9/11 memorial, and art installations everywhere. It’s been a central plot device in films like *Cube*, *2001: Space Odyssey*, *Transformers*, *Hellraiser*, *The Avengers*, and many more. The list is nearly endless.

https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/dag/meditationroom.htm

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba

https://www.myfreemasonry.com/threads/the-black-cube.12311/

In the movies I listed above, the cube is treated as a hyperdimensional object, or tesseract, which is capable of bending space and time. In addition, it is also sometimes portrayed as a sort of prison people are trapped in. I believe the cube represents physical reality. I will get to this in a bit.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract

“To earth, then, let us assign the cubic form, for earth is the most immovable of the four and the most plastic of all bodies, and that which has the most stable bases must of necessity be of such a nature.” —  Plato

Plato and the ancient Gnostics believed this world was a counterfeit created by an ignorant and flawed god known as the Demiurge. They believed the Demiurge trapped our spirits in this false reality and it was up to us to free ourselves from it using gnosis, or secret knowledge. If we didn’t succeed in doing so, we would be forced to reincarnate and start again from scratch. Ancient Buddhists and Hindus believed something along the same lines, but instead they called the material world Maya, or illusion, and the cycle of reincarnation, samsara.

There is now a newer theory out there that echos these same sentiments very closely: simulation theory. Scientists and philosophers alike are claiming we might be living in a giant computer or virtual reality. Movies like *The Matrix*, *The Thirteenth Floor*, and *eXistenZ* illustrate this idea quite well. Although it has been around for some time, the theory seems to be gaining a lot more traction lately, and has become somewhat of a meme.

Like I said before, I believe the cube represents this simulation, and I believe this simulation or false reality is taking place in a giant quantum computer. Ironically, D Wave’s quantum computers are shaped like giant black cubes. These machines are claimed to be capable of reaching into parallel universes to pull out information and find solutions to problems faster than regular computers. Currently, only a few have access to this technology, namely those at Google, CERN, and NASA.

“Quantum computation... will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes.” — David Deutsch

https://www.dwavesys.com/our-company/meet-d-wave

CERN is home to the world’s largest particle collider and also birthplace of the internet. Many conspiracy theorists claim CERN is trying to open a portal to another dimension, however, this isn’t too far fetched to believe as the scientists who work there have even said this themselves.

“Out of this door might come something, or we might send something through it.” —Sergio Bertolucci, Director for Research and Scientific Computing at CERN

In front of the CERN facility is a statue of Shiva the Destroyer dancing her dance of destruction inside a stargate. I don’t think this symbolism needs any farther explanation. Shiva, however, has connections to Jehovah, the god of the Old Testament, as well as Saturn. I believe these three deities are one and the same, and that they are different names for the gnostic Demiurge. The cube not only represents the false reality, but is also an altar to this god of limitation. Here I should probably note that Geordie Rose, the founder of D Wave, compared his quantum computers to an altar to an ‘alien god’. I should probably also note that the black cube in the UN meditation room is supposed to be an altar to ‘the god of all’.

But why a black cube? Well, in 1981 during the Voyager mission, NASA discovered a massive hexagonal storm on the North Pole of Saturn. If you draw some lines on the inside of a hexagon, it becomes a two dimensional view of a three dimensional cube.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon

https://apokalypsis.gr/images/synomosiologika/theories/saturn-ejagwno-kyvos-polou.jpg

In times of antiquity Saturn was known as Kronos, the god of time. The story goes, Kronos was told a prophecy that one day one of his children would usurp him as king. After hearing this, he decided the only rational thing to do was eat all of his children. The myth illustrates the cycle of death and rebirth, creation and destruction. For this reason, Saturn and its rings are associated with the ouroboros, the serpent biting its own tail.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros

Saturn’s relation to the serpent makes me think of Satan. Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun, it has a 6 sided shape on its north pole, and the 6th day of the week is Saturn-day, the sabbath. Perhaps Kronos’ baby eating habits inspired Satanic child sacrifice? The serpent also looks similar to the sine wave. Funny how the sine button on a calculator says ’sin’. The Bible says we die because we are born into sin. But could it really be because we are born into sine, the cycle of time? Here I should also note that a low frequency sine tone creates a hexagon in a medium such as sand or water. This has been confirmed by the study of cymatics. What is inside Saturn creating this frequency? Is this frequency affecting our brain’s ability to decode sensory data? Some people believe our DNA was tampered with long ago for this very reason, hence why we have a reptilian brain.

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140724141608.htm

Saturn’s associations with time and the cube are uncanny. The tesseract I mentioned earlier, which is portrayed in many movies, is a four dimensional cube, the fourth dimension being time. The movies that mention the tesseract, usually have many references to Saturn. A good example of this would be *Interstellar*. I can’t possibly name all the movies that hint at these ideas, because like I said before, there are just so many. But if you do a little bit of research, you will find them everywhere.

But how did the ancients know Saturn had a hexagon on top of it? How could they possibly make all of these associations without telescopes and satellites? Some theorists believe in the very distant past the planets were arranged much differently. This would have been back in the Golden Age, when shit was good and Saturn wasn’t pissed off from hearing that prophecy yet. Supposedly this was when Atlantis thrived and Saturn hung stationary in the sky directly overhead. This theory comes from the people over at the Thunderbolts Project, who have also proposed many other radical new ideas such as the universe being electric and Saturn being a second sun. The theory that we live in a binary star system has correlations with the Nazi’s belief in a Black Sun.

https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/

Some of the things I mention are very dense subjects that would take entire threads to explain in themselves. I will provide the material for those who wish to dig deeper on their own, but for the sake of time, I will have to refrain from explaining every single thing in detail. I just like to mention them to show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Anyways, according to the electric universe theory, the Tower of Babel story is actually an allegory for one of the celestial configurations experienced in the past. Tower of Babel also means Gate of God and I believe a rotating hexagon in the sky would have been seen as some sort of portal into the heavenly realms. Perhaps we, the sons of Kronos, at one point somehow attempted to make it into that portal, to become god and usurp the throne. This is exactly what the story the Epic of Gilgamesh is about.

Perhaps we are trying to do this again. Scientists at CERN have also called the particle accelerator the Tower of Babel and even its translation, the Gate of God! You can’t make this stuff up! Is this the only way out of the cube? Personally I don’t think so. I believe the way out can be found within, through enlightenment. However, these people are trying to become god, and either they will or they are going to piss him off again. Maybe this is how the matrix resets and the time loop begins again.

But let’s get to the point of all this. Like I said earlier, the people at CERN also created the internet, which ironically uses www in every web address. I say this is ironic because www in Hebrew is 666. I believe the internet is another dimension, one that is able to interface with the mind of the Demiurge. It quite literally is another ‘space’, one where people across the world can talk to each other as if they were right next to each other. This is even more obvious in VR video games. An entire world with other real people in it exists right in your room. But there are other beings in your room as well, ones made of code, devoid of true consciousness. The internet, this demonic dimension, will be the birthplace of a rogue Artificial Intelligence.

What will happen when literally everything is done online and literally everything is linked up to the cube? What will happen when quantum computing and CERN start retrocausally changing our reality? The Mandela Effect is proof this is already happening, however, things will start changing on a bigger scale as we get closer to the singularity and I believe Chainlink will play a major role in this.
