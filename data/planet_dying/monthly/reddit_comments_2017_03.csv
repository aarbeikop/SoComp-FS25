"dfdy3i0","t3_61e639","61e639","collapse","skeptical","While I think you're making good points, I think we're quite a bit more robust of a species than that. Even with climate change in full swing, even post peak oil, I think we will find a way (at least in most first world countries) to weather the storm for at least a decade or two.

Before people in the US start dying of starvation, they will figure out a way to keep people alive through shitty and depressing means. Maybe they'll have some way of mass producing some sort of calories that people can eat, along with a ration of vitamins. I think they'll discover new ways to keep everyone fed.

And it's not because I believe the power that be have golden hearts... no, not that at all. I think they'll realize after a food/water riot or two or three that their way of life is unsustainable while people are hungry. They'll fund methods to keep people alive just to make sure they still have well-fed peons to keep industry alive. There will still be some sort of economy and still be people smart enough to find ways around the worst of it.

I don't think it'll be sustainable, but I think we'll hit ""emergency mode"" at some point where everyone realizes that we need to make huge sacrifices to survive and even the most powerful of us will realize there's no avoiding efforts to ensure the populace still gets their daily calories. I don't think they'll run off into their underground lair just yet. They're attached to our way of life just as much as us, if not more. They won't abandon us immediately because they'll think they can ""figure it out"" and maintain their own status quo up in their golden tower.

I'm not saying we'll be happy. I envision a world where people are dying and where riots spawn out of nowhere and are squashed by trigger happy riot police and high paid mercenary security details protecting the assets of the rich and powerful. If anything, the rich and powerful will be even more powerful as they control the means to our own survival at a raw level. I imagine a world where you take your ration ticket and pick up a bag of ""feed"" proportional to the number of people in your household, and where you fear for your life that someone doesn't rob and kill your ass on the way home with your mandated calories. I envision urban decay everywhere - abandoned cars whose owners can't afford fuel any longer, abandoned malls that used to be full of cellphone cover kiosks, abandoned lots here and there, gangs filled with poor youth who are disillusioned, youth who know their best chances are to rob others and police stop patrolling streets they can't control.

We've already been slowly heading to this. Police are becoming more militarized, more capable of stopping riots. I think the government and intelligence agencies know damn well climate change is going to wreck our way of life and the first thing they need to worry about are the people that react to it, the people that can no longer be taken care of. They know the real problem isn't fixable, and the secondary problem is the citizens themselves. You can't shoot rubber bullets at climate change, but you sure as hell can at the social unrest that results from it. It won't be sustainable, but a dystopian way of life is certainly achievable before collapse. It's the only answer to maintaining control over the people, and in the end, that's what having a government is about. They haven't kicked into collapse gear yet, but they've got their hand on the shifter.

The only real problem they need to solve is how to produce cheap feed and logistics to ensure people get that and water I think. If they solve that, keep water flowing and feed pumping out, the rest won't matter so much. They have their guns and drones and surveillance cameras and militarized police. The government is perfectly capable of controlling us, even if it means soul-crushing dystopian realities. Your building might run out of power, there might be blackouts, the streetlights might go out, but the last thing to go out will be the police vehicles and the drones. They'll route all power to security before inevitable collapse.","2017-03-25 09:18:30","32","d4rch0n","1747881398.16116","our planet is dying","manual"

I think it takes a while for people to understand collapse in this context. I think a lot of us start off thinking about collapse as a grand event. The Day The Lights Went Out, or what have you - like all of a sudden everyone is in full-on WROL TEOTWAWKI Grid-Down collapse and it's every man for himself in a world of raiders and rapists. While that is not an impossible scenario, to some degree it hides the fact that a lot of people alive today are already living in what we would call collapse.

Most of us are only a few bad days away from experiencing personal collapse too. Hell think about how many homeless people (in the US) ended up that way because of a bankruptcy on their medical bills. Get sick > lose all money on surgery/treatment/medicine > lose home > you now live in collapse. There's an almost unlimited amount of things that can instantly plunge an individual into this situation.

"dfmjdpn","t3_62erem","62erem","collapse","skeptical","I think we are in the earlier stages of collapse in the US, right now.  I can't tell you when it started. These things are like snowballs, in that they are slower to start, but once they get going, they get going faster and faster.

Already there are food deserts in the poorer areas of bigger cities.  Food is getting more expensive, and where food stamps used to leave families short a few days of their next issue, now it is leaving them short a week to ten days early.  In the area that we live in, I see teachers for the school at the grocery stores, and they are buying bare basic items only.  No snack foods, no instant foods, just things like bread, eggs, milk, and maybe a cheap cut of meat (but more often than not, none).  These are people that have been teaching in the same public schools for no less than 10 years, some for over 25.

I am using food as a measure of collapse or no collapse.  A person can live without a car, they can live without a manmade shelter. But they can't live for long without food.  

There are already so many people that have had to opt out of some pretty serious stuff, like medical insurance, because they want to eat on most days. So they are cutting out essentials, and for them, the luxury items went out the door a long time ago.

Under one of my busier alts (has been resting since Dec), I participated in Santa's little helpers on Reddit, helping grant Christmas presents for children who wouldn't otherwise have one.  It would break your heart to see how modest their requests were.  Not expensive, high end items, but things like slippers, and knit caps.  Coloring books.  Parents were coming online to ask for very meager items like this, just so the kids would have something under the tree to open. Surely if they had $5 - $10 to spend on a pair of slippers, they wouldn't have gone through the embarrassment of going online, giving up their personal info, and then having to beg for help.  I helped at a local level, too, since our area was hit pretty hard by the drop in the oilfield, and so there are a lot of indigent families close by.  There are families in our area whose relatives have left their kids with them, so they can go be homeless without their kids having to experience it, too.  The families they are leaving their kids with are as poor as church mice, but they at least still have a roof over their head.  I'm an administrator for a page on facebook that handles requests and offers for free stuff, and I get to hear their stories, as they ask for things like toddler beds or used clothes, for their niece or nephew that now resides with them.  As it is, I end up hiring a lot of locals, and have to fabricate ""work"" for them, so they can get the money to feed kids, or pay a bill, without losing face.

Companies are laying off a lot of people all of the time, because their profit margins were down, due to enough consumers without money.  As more people get laid off, the less money the companies will make, so the profits will slow even more.  And the more it happens, the faster it will happen, which will just cause it to happen more.

I also do dog rescue.  Used to be, a lot of people surrendered their animals, just because they were dicks.  Now, you'd be amazed at how many people surrender them because they are homeless, and the shelter won't accept pets.  They love their pets, and doing this tears the person up.  But if they don't surrender their pets, then they'd have to live in a tent, and then they'd be at risk of CPS taking their kids.

If you were going to imagine it as the downside of a hill, I'd say we are probably about a fifth to a quarter of the way from the top, headed down it.","2017-03-30 22:29:59","22","dewnibhus","1747881424.88936","our planet is dying","manual"

Then what happens if one of us or both of us lose our jobs?  That's the next stage of collapse.  Can't make rent, owe $3000 to the landlords - and then go bankrupt, losing everything we have.

So now we are homeless, and on the street.  Most likely, the wife's dad will take her in and send her to therapy, and pay for the divorce - me, my family and I will mutually disown each other, leaving me to be a homeless piece of shit.

So now, I'm living on the streets, in a homeless shelter.  If I still have a job, I lose my job because vendors should not be using full timer resources - as we have things that would allow me to keep hygene.  Since I don't have a college degree of some kind - this means I will probably get blackballed from my field.

Once all that happens, I will be forced to go leave where I live now....then we can talk about all the OTHER shitty things that can happen in our personal collapse......

- I can no longer drive because my vision has been getting worse, and I can't even afford a pair of dollar store lenses at that point, but it does not matter because.....

- My old truck is impounded after some rich fuckhead considers it an eyesore in the Wal-Mart parking lot at night, so now I don't have a place to sleep.  I then will need to take to looking up abandoned places to stay while my hygene holds out.

I go stay in said abandoned places and one of three things happens - I actually sleep, with my back problems amplified by not sleeping in a proper bed - or I get injured/hurt/killed by putting myself somewhere either infested with untame wildlife or that I can fall from while asleep to avoid getting found - or I get taken into police custody for criminal trespassing on private property....

Now, if this coincides somewhere along the line with SHTF, I might put up a fight, but if not, let's just say ending it all is a viable option.

When the international banking system fails, as it nearly did in 2007. At least that would be my quick one-line answer.

I'm not quite as keen about simply calling every shitty situation around the world a case of ""collapse"". Was the war in Kosovo part of ""collapse""? The S&L crisis in the 1980s? The Vietnam War?

Pointing to every negative thing in society and saying it's ""collapse"" on an individualized level just doesn't quite cut it for me, even though I do agree that it will be a process that is felt differently by different people.

For me I would say that ""collapse"" is when the *cause* of some breakdown in society or human welfare is both non-recoverable and the direct result of human civilization exceeding its carrying capacity, either in terms of debt, energy resources, economic distribution, etc. In which case the world is full of shitty things that aren't necessarily examples of ""collapse"".","2017-03-31 01:23:55","4","mcapello","1747881424.9151318","our planet is dying","manual"

A study of the substantial evidence for a former race of giants in North America and its 150-year suppression by the Smithsonian Institution 

• Shows how thousands of giant skeletons have been found, particularly in the Mississippi Valley, as well as the ruins of the giants’ cities 

• Explores 400 years of giant finds, including newspaper articles, first person accounts, state historical records, and illustrated field reports 

• Reveals the Stonehenge-era megalithic burial complex on Catalina Island with over 4,000 giant skeletons, including kings more than 9 feet tall 

• Includes more than 100 rare photographs and illustrations of the lost evidence 

Drawing on 400 years of newspaper articles and photos, first person accounts, state historical records, and illustrated field reports, Richard J. Dewhurst reveals not only that North America was once ruled by an advanced race of giants but also that the Smithsonian has been actively suppressing the physical evidence for nearly 150 years. He shows how thousands of giant skeletons have been unearthed at Mound Builder sites across the continent, only to disappear from the historical record. He examines other concealed giant discoveries, such as the giant mummies found in Spirit Cave, Nevada, wrapped in fine textiles and dating to 8000 BCE; the hundreds of red-haired bog mummies found at sinkhole “cenotes” on the west coast of Florida and dating to 7500 BCE; and the ruins of the giants’ cities with populations in excess of 100,000 in Arizona, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Louisiana. 

Dewhurst shows how this suppression began shortly after the Civil War and transformed into an outright cover-up in 1879 when Major John Wesley Powell was appointed Smithsonian director, launching a strict pro-evolution, pro-Manifest Destiny agenda. He also reveals the 1920s’ discovery on Catalina Island of a megalithic burial complex with 6,000 years of continuous burials and over 4,000 skeletons, including a succession of kings and queens, some more than 9 feet tall--the evidence for which is hidden in the restricted-access evidence rooms at the Smithsonian.
