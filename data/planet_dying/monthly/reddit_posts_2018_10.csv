"9p0nly","Conservative","unknown","An American Catharsis","  

Having signed up for a new internet community service, ""Free Talk 24""(freetalk24.com, created by One America News Network), my adventure into user posts began. Along the way I encountered threads discussing the state of America. People from all over, posting meme's, support for President Trump, presentation's summarizing the new administrations successes, and the unending evidence of the past administration’s failures, corruption, lies all evidence of the Democrats attempt to destroy our country. 

As middle-aged naturalized American's my wife and I watch, listen and read vigorously about our Country. Prior to the 2016 election we found ourselves without much hope, at times discussing where we can move outside of our Country if Hillary won the upcoming election. For many years we had watched the dismantling of our America. When Trump won the election a new hope stirred, we were wide eyed and optimistic. It seemed there might be hope after all, for the first time in decades we felt cautious optimism. For so long we've felt imprisoned by our Government, slowly sheading our freedoms and rights, more and more strangled by the system. Such dark day's passing one by one, edict's flowing from the highest seat in the land, subverting our founder's design for our Republic. As I write this reflecting on how we felt prior to Trump's victory I'm realizing the depth of despair set upon us, terrifying (my poor children), in some way this looming fear of our own Government must be how the 2.5 million colonists must have felt before armed conflict broke out. 

Here I sit, grasping onto faith that was instilled in my youth, once again we the people, finally have a citizen statesman leading the Republic. Inspiration is an odd feeling, having felt so helpless for so long, in some way writing this, which started as a response to one of the posting on freetalk24.com, has turned into a surge of catharsis. What follows is where my response began, the opening may seem random, at the time one of the posts spoke of an enemy, some undefinable entity that has materialized, built and become more aggressive in my lifetime. Is this what a REVELATION feels like? Writing this I realize why I've felt so vulnerable and small for so long, this concealed entity has slowly revealed a complete system, judicial, religious, political, social, economic, executive (Obama) and as its final targeted takeover military component's. Thank god our military is the last bastion of Patriotism that have battled and refused to surrender America.

""They"" were and still are in many ways very close to establishing a complete centralized state, in our case a deep state. This ""State"" within our nation is embedded within the ""Acronym Agencies"", i.e. EPA, DHHS, FCC, FAA, FDA, DOD, FBI, and so on. Not accountable or elected by we the people. With a Social Justice (socialism by any other name) agenda these supposed American's employ the power of the state against their opponents (DOD or IRS pursue you if you're not on their plantation), a Fascist authoritarian suppression of an opponent. Recent leaders have rented and sold American policy, intellectual property and state secrets, a systematic war to dismantle our Republic, of course enriching themselves in the process.

As much as our own success and blessings have allowed American apathy to flourish, we have been the victims of an assault, an organized media propaganda campaign to nurture apathy and hopelessness in our citizens. Our country is at war, a covert war waged within our own politic body, the enemy is embedded at every level of our government and the media. Their goal is clear, to destroy our Republic. Globalization, destroy national sovereignty, create national debt and a financial crisis, force open borders and mass immigration, permanently destroy our culture, dismantle the American family, those that don't assimilate will be silenced.

From out of nowhere our last best hope has been delivered, a citizen statesman in our highest office. Trump is well aware of the corrupt enemy that is embedded within our branches of government. He has a plan to get control back, to punish those responsible and ultimately to expose and win the covert war to usurp our constitution. 

Our President's authority is decentralized, designed by our framers to act with neither efficiency nor dispatch. It is obvious the so-called political parties are in conflict. The House of Representatives and the Senate must be empowered to support our Chosen President's righteous task, to return our government to the people. Separate institutions sharing power in this time of war must coalesce, put aside their rivalries and cooperate to once again reestablish our federalist Republic. 

In this time, our task to root out the corrupt elected and unelected bureaucrat's requires citizens to VOTE their value's not their party. Due to the mass propaganda effort some might have difficulty even defining the values our founders embedded at the core of our country. Let us reflect historically on some of our nations divinely inspired values your VOTE is fighting for.

1. We value that all men being born free are endowed with rights to life and liberty; each individual's right to life is inviolable; each individual's liberty is considered an unalterable aspect of the human condition.

2. We value our creator who endowed us with unalienable rights, truth is at the core each right, all men are equal under these righteous truths.

3. We value each citizen having the right to pursue happiness unhampered.

4. We value the right to speak and express ourselves freely.

5. We value the right to freely exercise religious diversity.

6. We value and protect property rights where people can freely acquire, use, and dispose of personal property.

7. We the people give government it's powers for this strictly limited purpose of securing citizens' rights, the government shall have limited power which protect the rights of all citizens.

8. We value individual Liberty, we are free to think, speak and act independently.

9. We value the common good and community welfare.

10. We value due process in the pursuit of justice, protected from denial or delay of justice.

11. We value self-governance, of the people, by the people, for the people.

12. We value Individual identity is held sacred and that dignity and integrity should not be violated

13. We value that to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness.

14. We value that all citizens have political and legal equality, treated as equals before the law we are not to be denied these rights unless by due process of law.

15. We value the reasonable expectation of privacy.

16. We value states having an equal voice in the senate and each state's influence in selecting the President as protected by our founder’s grand federal design that respects the sovereign role of states via the Electoral College.

17. We value strictly limited government, Federalism's separation of powers between our three branches of government, the bi-cameral legislation (House of Representatives & Senate), Executive and judicial. We value checks and balances between each branch to limit the powers of the others.

18. We value the right of the people to keep and bear arms, not to be infringed. We value the right to keep and bear arms to defend against mob rule, government tyranny and for the purpose of self-defense.

19. We value true justice, a fair and equal system of rules and laws, administered with fairness and equality for all 

20. We value our citizens common defense by our government from another country or nation.

21. We value domestic tranquility, living in a peaceful society where common people are protected.

In many ways our liberties, freedoms and values have already fallen victim in this covert war within America. Marxism has penetrated all levels of government agencies, especially the central bureaucracy. Whereas in the past the Federal Government was not involved in the education system, it is now predominant. Our children have been under attack, the education system has effectively been captured and is now doing the bidding of the enemy, threatening the future of our nation. Socialism, atheism, evolution, economic determinism, anti-traditional framework of sex and family, moral relativism and communism are all a part of the new American curriculum, taught every day in schools across America. This tactic has impacted every grade level even higher education. Destruction and corruption of the American education system has come to pass.

""Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of the teachers' associations. Put the party line in text books."", The naked communist, W. Cleon Skousen. Goal achieved!

Our country is being changed from within, this is your wakeup call. You are at war, whether you want it or not, you have no choice in this matter. America has been under attack for multiple generations, Sun Tzu would be proud, avoid strength attack weakness! America is likely the most transparent and open society on the planet. America's immigration, education and political systems are all identifiable weaknesses. Each of these systems has been used to penetrate our country from within. Elected officials are not required to have a background check once elected, they only need be a citizen for nine years, meet an age requirement and live in the state they wish to serve. Simple, yet effective, immigrate, run for office, serve in any capacity and continue moving up, rinse and repeat with 100's of agents. Now you have multiple levels of control within the American government. Influence and change culture, policies and laws. Alternatively, the enemy can also purchase corrupt traitors of America to do their bidding in the halls of power, with the same outcome. Infiltrate the education system using similar methods, accomplished much easier. Change literature, curriculum, and campus culture. Influence America's youth for generations, prepare the youth for communist and socialist agendas. Use the youth to advocate for the same agenda's, use the youth to create mobs, riots, atrocities and other public discord. This has already come to pass.

American's must realize the current battlespace, it is far reaching, well beyond this summary level text. Acknowledging we are active participant's in a covert war is a starting point. The next step is to take active steps taking a counter offensive where possible. This operation has bad actors within our own government, our own education system and in some cases our children have been turned against us. This seriously limits viable alternatives to fight back. Right now, we have a unique opportunity. Mid-term elections are right around the corner, your VOTE is the first salvo as a warrior of freedom.

1.5 million American's have died wearing America's uniform since the founding of our country. This is your chance to be a warrior for our freedom, stomp on your complacency, shred your apathy, have faith in yourself and your countrymen, we can and will be victorious. Our American spirit may have been sleeping, but you can feel it waking, let it roar! In appreciation of our Liberty, the greatness of America we must fight, each and every one of us. Fight for yourself, for your children, for your countrymen, we must be victorious! 

Attention soldier, your direct fire weapon is your VOTE. You finally have an effective weapon in this prolonged battle. Vote your values not your party, these values are shared by everyone in our nation. Values are not party centric, this nation was organized based on our founders’ values, they are embedded in the fabric of this country, in your community, in the constitution, the bill of rights and declaration of independence. 

To achieve victory, we have to enable our president to enact the policies necessary to retake our country. We must not vote party lines, contemplate your principals, values, beliefs, ethics, and moral virtues. 

Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth. we must be engaged, WAKE UP, DRAW YOUR VOTING WEAPON, fire the KILL vote (shot) that will enable the retaking of our country. Vote Republican align the 3 branches of government, eliminate the resistance, deny the obstructionist, cease the delays, stop the destruction of our Country, VOTE REPUBLICAN.","2018-10-17 17:18:47","1","0","0.54","https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9p0nly/an_american_catharsis/","True","SaveUSRepublic","1747917031.248519","our planet is dying","manual"
"9km9pa","vegan","unknown","Why Meat...?","Why do we eat meat? Meat is something we are Told that is good for Us. Even on Medical Websites. Meat is a diabetic product selled in Stores and Pretty much every store we go to. We are not supposed to eat Something that is chamacliezied and Killed with chain saws, Axes, Knives.  Why? Society thinks Meat is the only source to Nutrition. But it isn't. Fruits and Vegetables is the main Source. And Milk. Schools have nothing but Milk. Students age from 5-18. Scientists say Milk is not Supposed to be In the body after the age of 1. And Milk Doesn't help your bone's. Celery does. We don't need all of thing's to help us. This is why So many are in the hospital because Of meat. Because of all of these animal Products. And all of these things, Meat, Milk everything. So, Hear me out. Because We are just slaying Animals. They hold cows and Pigs in Cages to be milked and Killed so we can  eat. That's just stupid. And What if caveman didn't survive just on Meat. What if they ate Plants. And Fish are being feed Plastic because we are always throwing Plastic in the water. Plastic is Killing our planet. Polarbears are dying because of Gas from the cars we use to get to work and drive around when We have electric cars that don't even hurt the planet one bit. So wake up and do something.","2018-10-02 01:07:55","2","2","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/9km9pa/why_meat/","True","FoxyPlays3210","1747917168.729672","our planet is dying","manual"
"9nxzzh","conspiracy","unknown","Expedition to the North Pole 2019-2020","You may be aware or unaware, that I and my constituents are planning an independent expedition to the roof of the world, the North Pole to independently verify and study the reports of an entrance into the Inner Earth. Whether the Earth is a globe, flat, hollow, or a triangle is irrelevant. This expedition is not investigate the shape of the planet, it is rather an attempt to enter the planet, it’s intricate, presumably populated interior, through the Pole. 

**What this is** 

1. A genuine attempt to make a statement that mankind should be made aware of the truth of the nature of Earth. 

2. An attempt to independently document and verify any paranormal findings. 

3. A crusade to petition the forces that may exist within the Earth that the time for the truth to be made clear is now. 

**What this is not** 

1. A joke. 

2. A social event. 

3. Safe for individuals who lack the appropriate strength and will to navigate the harshest conditions on Earth. 

4. A cult. 

**Rules**

1. Must be verified and checked thoroughly through our screening process. 

2. Must be physically and psychologically capable and willing to handle the journey, and potential death. 

3. Must be unmarried, and willing to die for this cause. 

**A brief description of the journey**

We will be traveling over land by bus. We will not risk any unfortunate “accidents” that tend to happen via boat or plane. We will make our way through Canada and the coast of Greenland, only traveling by boat for brief periods across the frozen waters. I have no intention of dying like Leonardo. This is not a risk we are willing to take. 

The two options for us to leave will be Spring/Summer 2019 or Spring/Summer 2020. If we can gather the right people by 2019 we will go but we are willing to wait one year to do so, to ensure that we are properly trained and ready. No government or corporate employees will be permitted to join us, with the exception of people with past military experience. Those ex-military who go will understandably be researched and checked. No two military people who know each other may come. 

I will have the travel paid for, as well as most of the food. We shall document everything thoroughly. If you wind up coming you’ll need to bring some of your own supplies and be prepared to let go of all of your attachments to home. This is likely a one way trip. This will be the first time in 74 years that an expedition like this has occurred and we may well end up being imprisoned for attempting to do so. I can’t make any promises regarding your safety. The goal is to have 60-120 people, no more and no less. I need fishermen, scientists, hunters, frontiersmen, ex-soldiers, and other specialists as well as anyone else who is willing to train themselves, likely at a facility in the Northern United States for three weeks before we go. 

I cannot express to you the importance of this mission. I am considering it a suicide mission. I’ll explain more later. But this is just to set a basic expectation. The range of what could happen stretches from saving mankind to failing and being tortured and killed. Supernatural things will happen. I’ll explain more later, as I said.
