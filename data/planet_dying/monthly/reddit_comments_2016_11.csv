"d9vyr81","t3_5cf8ep","5cf8ep","environment","emotional","For some reason reddit is deleting the spaces between paragraphs. It's pretty hard to read in its current format so here's a shorter version:

The coal industry lost 50,000 jobs from 2008-2012. In that same period solar and wind power added 80,000 jobs. Wind and solar power are also getting far cheaper and more commercially viable than they used be. In 1977 the cost of solar was $76.67 per watt. In 2014 it costs a mere $0.49 per watt. That's an insane price reduction that consistently decreases every year. Even if no government action is taken to run the United States on renewable energy it’s clear to see how solar and wind power may just outcompete fossil fuel regardless. In another amazing example the relatively newly formed electric car (and now solar panel) company “Tesla” generated more money last quarter than the entire oil industry in the United States, who lost 67 billion dollars that same year.
	Taxing renewable energy sources, investing in fossil fuels, and deregulating businesses is a step backwards for America. Fossil fuels are a limited resource that will run dry, it doesn’t make sense to try and revive these industries. Imagine if all the near deserted oil fields in Texas and North Dakota were made into solar or wind farms. Imagine if solar panels or solar tiles were installed in the majority of homes in the United States, currently less than 1% of homes utilize solar power. There’s hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created in the renewable energy sector and hundreds of thousands of Americans that could reinvigorate the economy. Protecting the environment does not have to equal a loss of jobs, in fact just the opposite. The economy and the environment are entirely capable of growing side by side. Investing in the future of America and its pristine wilderness is among the best ways to make America great again.

When it was just a little bit colder, (ie. -4°C) ice sheets covered quite a bit of North America and Europe. By your logic, one might also wonder: How is this bad?

After all, does it really matter in the grand scheme of things if Chicago, New York, Moskau, London, etc. were covered under miles of ice? When you put it that way, no. Of course not! The universe doesn't care.

The humans currently living in these areas, however, might find it a little bit inconvenient if glaciers were slowly advancing to their home towns. Sure, they wouldn't die directly. But can you really think there would be no economic fallout if millions and millions of people were forced to move?

In a [previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/56df06/indias_highestranking_economist_just_announced/d8lnyfl/), you said it ""would be naive in thinking"" that ""humans are by nature good"". Well, if that is so, what do you think would happen when millions of people were moving closer to the equator; places were some other millions of people already live?

Here's a current example: Germany – a country with about 80 million people – are currently trying to adapt to a mere 1 million refugees from Syria and Afghanistan. This shouldn't be too hard, since it's only a population growth of a little bit more than 1 per cent. However, what we do see is rising prices for houses and apartments. We do see social conflicts and people voting for a new right-wing party.

When it gets about 4°C warmer, [North Africa and the Middle East will be too hot](http://phys.org/news/2016-05-climate-exodus-middle-east-north-africa.html) (since it won't be a dry heat) to live in. The current population is 371 million people in the Middle East and another 200 million in North Africa. What would happen if these people decide to move to the European Union (pop. about 510 million) because of the heat?

Do you really think such an influx of people with different cultural values would happen peacefully?","2016-11-13 13:19:36","1","[deleted]","1747875266.886383","our planet is dying","manual"

""Please clarify your position on that"" (Mercury)
You said it cannot get to hot for plant growth.  Do you think there are plants on Mercury?  I was being flippant.  There are places on Earth today too extreme for robust plant growth.  C02 and sunlight are not the only requirements for plant growth.
The thrust of your original post was that change is good.  Change is not always good.  I was being flippant again when I said keep the CO2 level right there because you cannot stop mankind or the Earth from effecting atmospheric change wherever you like it.  Your assumption that mankind will increases and reduce greenhouse gasses as needed for your utopia is naive.  Mankind does not alter course until things become dire.  Climate is not a car, you can't just put it in reverse after you hit a wall.
C02 is not the only greenhouse gas, and warming is not the only result of increased greenhouse gasses.  People have been profiting off you while filling the air and waters with poisons your whole life.  Is that ok?

Rather than looking at the average, look at individual places and see what the changes might be. There are many places where *many* people live that will become uninhabitable or barely habitable. There are also places where relatively few people live (Canada, O Canada) that will be much more habitable. Overall, a two degree rise will be *much* *much* *worse* for *most* people.

There is reason the scientific community dropped the term global warming and changed it to ""climate change"". It's because in the last 100 years the global temp has only risen 0.5 degrees and it fluctuates up and down if you look even further. We see change, and yes not all change is good, but it's not all bad. And I'm asking you to check the evidence I provided for you. Stop only looking at one side of the argument.

Ok, I took your bait and looked at the geocraft website that was last updated in 2011 by someone with no bio.  Is that the best you can do?

You posted this paragraph from the UCLA website.
""The burning of fossil fuels at the presently alarming rate increases global warming.  This is due to the increasing amount of greenhouse gases, specifically CO2, which capture heat easily thus increasing global temperature.  Although alarming now, this had a positive effect in periods such as those between the Permian and Triassic where there was heavy glaciation periods followed by a large release of carbon.""

Here is the second part of their statement you omitted.
""At present, there is a fear of the greenhouse effect increasing global warming to an almost dangerous high.  The excess carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is responsible for the gradual yet constant rise in temperature over the past few decades. Certain wave lengths coming form the sun, mainly infrared radiation, are trapped by greenhouse gases and kept in the earth's atmosphere. These gases block the re-radiation of infrared waves back out into space, causing the global temperature to increase.""

I think you missed the point.
Two things from the paragraph you posted.
""The burning of fossil fuels at the presently alarming rate increases global warming"", and
""Although alarming now"".

And this from the second part of their statement.
""At present, there is a fear of the greenhouse effect increasing global warming to an almost dangerous high"".

We are in 2016.  The Triassic preriod was 50 million years ago.

Here is another definition of science.

I am sure there is not a legitimate climate scientist who does not see the entire global timeline.  That is basic.  The volcanoes have not stopped.  Now we get to deal with volcanoes, and man made emissions.
Is is so terrible if Al Gore made money on solar panels and batteries, and scientists were paid to do important research?  Governments steal the public's money for greed, destruction and killing.  It's kind of hard to get worked up about low the hanging fruit.
We were not here 50 million years ago and it is pure conjecture to suggest climate, weather, bacteria, virus, predators etc. would have been condusive to comfortable living.  Plant growth is not the only factor for comfortable living.
Heating is problematic as water expands when heated, and landlocked ice melts, so low lying populations are being displaced by rising seas.  Cold region populations cannot live off of sea ice.  Tempurature increase is not nominal over the entire globe and creating changes in weather patterns, disrupting migration habits of animals, pests, beneficial insects, disease, weather, fires and drought.  Change is not always good.
