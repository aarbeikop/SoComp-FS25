Yes, I have success-stories in that regard with at least two ""converts"" that I am 100% sure are my accomplishment and some that I may or may not have been part of the influce. But unfortunately that is not transferable to everyone.

What was common between my 2 converts was their above average intelligence. I think this really is one of two requirements to have a good chance. People must be capable of questioning their believes and doing research on their own. Just ""forcefeeding"" them information and hoping it would have the same result it had on you really doesn't work when the critical thinking isn't there.

The other requirement is compassion. I also know highly intelligent people who manage to twist reality in such a way with their words that their selfish behavior always somehow prevails. 

Note that sometimes compassionate people have dealt with the cognitive dissonance by changing their self-image from ""I am compassionate"" to ""I don't care"". I'd say here you also have a chance.

The vast majority of people will just do whatever the majority does. They often are willfully ignorant and will ""forget"" all the things they learned from you between one discussion and the other. Regardless how many resources you have cites.

One thing that I'm currently experimenting with is outright telling people that I perceive them as being more selfish than compassionate. Of course I receive backlash for that but it seems really triggering in terms of people trying to justify themselves. The thing is that this ""thesis"" is really difficult to disprove for them and it is very easy to point out any contradictions in their justifications. This approach, however, runs contrary to the ""find common things and go from there""-approach by Melanie Joy.
But to me it's so much easier to just be honest rather than using carefully planned psycho-tricks.","2018-03-05 16:41:45","1","Xilmi","1747905227.0307178","our planet is dying","manual"

You explained how I see things incredibly well, and gave me some new things to think about, especially regarding Christianity and Jesus.

I admit that I did only just awaken during the last election cycle. Since then, I feel like I have learned more about history and what is actually going on than I had in all the previous years of my life. My research has led me to many of the same conclusions you have come to, and you have pointed out some things that I haven't yet realized but make so much sense (like the Tower of Babel, for example).

This is the first post I have saved, I look forward to reading the links that I'm not already familiar with. Thanks for taking the time to write this, and I also appreciate your positive tone!

"dvc0i8v","t3_82p5um","82p5um","conspiracy","unknown","You are right that the so-called Saturn Death Cult is one of the biggest conspiracy there is. 

there are specific technologies and practices they have kept largely hidden since the Ancient egyptians, namely the secret to accessing our own inner wisdowm and power. They have been acting under the guise of secret societies like the illuminat for centuries.

here is specifically what they are keeping hidden:

1. chakra enhancing technologies and practices. The chakras are what enables us to unlock the higher powers. The pineal gland (third eye)  is kept intentionally calcified withdiet and lack of stimulation. the pineal gland manages the chakra system via the endocrine system in our body.

2. the true ideology of our universe, Law of One. They have given us pieces of it spread through christianity, buddhism, and islam, but its just pieces. Having knowledge of the ideology or anything closely aligned with the deep truth unlocks immense amount of individual power

3. There are currently two paths for humans to tap into their deeper, almost unlimited potential. 

    - meditation to the point you transcend your ego and identity

- dissociation so that you bypass your ego and lesser self. Think MK ultra.

The dissociation path is a morally bad path with no control. Dissociative states are often induced by harsh, systematic abuse. The soul has a pain tolerance threshold, once it is reached the psyche dissociates bypassing the part of the brain filtering out greater potential. Its like a defense mechanism. During dissociation you have no awareness, no self control, and u r basically a slave. The other path requires a lot more work abd is much harder, but it allows you to be aware of and lucidly control your deeper power.

Most gurus who say they are enlightened have actually just figured out how to dissociate while gaining some memory of it.

"dvc0whh","t3_82p5um","82p5um","conspiracy","unknown","Note:  please don't take my contradictory and critical nature to mean I don't think this post was fantastic, because I do.

In regards to the spiritual discussion in your post,  I don't really think concealment of knowledge is an issue.  The only path to enlightenment is a path of constant reformation, pushed forward by the developed skill of non-attachment to beliefs.  The ability to identify all things as temporary, including one's understandings.

What is or isn't revealed to people is irrelevant.  Those who are on a path of truth seeking cannot be kept from it, because the truth is inside themselves.  Those who would seek to mislead will only serve to push that journey forward, because any attempt would be examined, and become part of the very process that brings about enlightenment.

On the other hand, those that would be misled by misinformation could be led by useful information and guidance as well, sure.  But, how effective is that really?  They are still being led, and there is no understanding to be gained in being told something rather than experiencing it.

Those who give in to desires without regard (or with purposeful disregard) of harm they do, do so because they can't help it.  It doesn't matter who or what, that is the very nature of desire.  The illusion that one makes a choice to do this or that provides the basis for hatred, both of others and of the self.  There is no choice.  Enlightenment is the path towards truly understanding that, and when one sees that then they act harmoniously because there is no resistance, no pull towards this or that, and no need to gratify an urge that has no real substantiation.
