"3261f3","vegan","unknown","The secret to dealing with non vegans","**TLDR:**
Chill out and talk to them like you'd talk to a drunk best friend if you were their designated handler for the duration of their interaction. 

**LONGER:**
Don't try to reason with them or overcome their cognitive dissonance, just give them information they may need to come to a rigorously evaluated, moral conclusion on their own. 

Share information, not your own preferences or intentions. Did you become happy to be vegan all at once, or was it the end result of the knowledge you accumulated of your own volition? Facilitate them, empower them to seek their own nonbiased information about the impacts of eating meat, so the more they're confronted with the disparity between their actions and their common humanistic desire to not be a source of suffering, the more they'll come to comprehend and further their own evolution. 

Why do I say this? Note that I don't have peer-reviewed research to back up my theories, but in my own personal experience as a former carnist, eating meat or binging on high protein foodstuffs makes it harder for me to pass poops. My bowels and thus circulatory system fill with decompositional byproducts, and this basic yet constant discomfiture makes it harder to think, be positively energetic and enact nonviolence consistently. While humans like to think they're above their animal needs, it's not as if our brains can function without proper input from our bodies, and being stuffed full of decomposing food all the time limits our abilities to supply the brain with good blood oxygen and things. 

Eating food of any kind is behaviorally addictive; it evokes pleasurable physiological responses commensurate with the absence of hunger, and when you don't eat enough of the right things, you crave to consume. If even the most sentient being is bound by these rules, how can you hope to overcome them with your subjective logic. You have to chill out and let them realize in their own time. Sure, the Earth is dying because of us, and we're running out of time, but if the planet isn't ready for our species to finish coming to terms with its own bullshit, then nothing we can do will save us from the halls of extinction.  

If you make it personal, people take offense, and when they're stricken by negative reactionary emotions, do their feelings not drown the voices of reason within their own minds and hearts? Why engage in argument, confrontation or other emotional violence? Instead of  doing verbal combat like a carnist, present reason like a vegan.

Sources: I eat food and do drugs and then I fast and don't do drugs in a scientific fashion in search of empirical evidence so that I may eventually conduct my corporeal vessel to a most fortuitous death and return its chemical energy to the planet.","2015-04-10 21:47:18","15","12","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/3261f3/the_secret_to_dealing_with_non_vegans/","True","anwarhahj","1747841509.6845062","our planet is dying","manual"
"33q9mq","vegan","unknown","Wanted to write this for people who are having some difficulty maintaining the vegan lifestyle..","There are many reasons people choose to follow a vegan lifestyle. It could be health, moral, or environmental.  Whether you choose one or all of those reasons, if you are living vegan you are aiding all of those causes. I read all the time how difficult it is, or how a person just can’t resist cravings. It may seem hard, but if you think about what exactly this lifestyle is doing, changing what you purchase is just so elementarily easy. Veganism is a movement that is working to change the entire planets view on what we consume. The fact is that just by you not buying that leather jacket or hamburger is doing something that is different from a viewpoint that humanity has had for thousands of years. There may be times when it seems hard, but if everyone would give up when something was too hard or too inconvenient the world would be a disaster. When slavery was still in place, and the underground railroad was thriving, does anybody consider how difficult it was for the people harboring those slaves? It is something that they would have been attacked for even though to us now it seems very brave and we commend those people. This will be the same with vegans. We are trying to change tradition, trying to change how people handle their own health, treat animals, and treat the environment. You do not have to believe in all of those reasons, but it is an all inclusive package. Whenever you are weak, remember that you are a part of and at the forefront of one of the most monumental changes in all of human history. The scale on which animals are murdered and enslaved is unmatched to any amount of human deaths, ever. The amount of people that die early, or develop terrible diseases as a result of dietary choices is in one of the worst states in the world. The environmental impact humans are having on this planet will drive us to extinction if we can not change our state of mind. Veganism can and will change all of those things. What you are doing for your species, other species, and the planet is unmatched to any action in the past. It may not seem like it is as huge of a movement as I am describing, but that is only because of how easy it is. Good luck, I love, and believe in you.
