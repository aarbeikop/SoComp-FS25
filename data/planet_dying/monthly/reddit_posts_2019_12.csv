"e9pcxe","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I feel like a whole generation is being sterilized by corporate greed and encouraged to be lonely and depressed. I don't even know where I'm going to go with this post so bear with me. Buckle up buckaroo because it's going to be a wild ride.","[Throwaway because my main account is filled with enough depressing shit already.]

I think there are two kinds of people living in a prosperous country. Those who contribute to society and those who leech off of it, even though I dream of being the former, I know that I'm the latter. Because that's what I am. A dreamer, and an unrealistically big dreamer at that.

It's hard to get out of poverty when you spent your entire life in it. My life sucked since the day I was born, beaten at home and bullied at school, I don't know how to make friends or keep a job. My parents taught me two things: how to get stepped on and how to quickly get in debt. I desperately tried to be different, to become even moderately succesful. Sadly it was not to be.

I'm typing this from my one room appartment, laying in bed at 3 in the afternoon, hungry but too unmotivated to get up and make a sandwich. I don't even remember the last time I ate a decent meal. Another month spent playing guitar, videogames and paying a chunk off of my debt, a debt I don't even know how I got. I don't even know why I'm in debt.

I know how I got here but all I wish to know is why. So many things happened that I didn't have control over, it all seems so unfair, unreal even. But sadly this is my reality. As my stomach grumbles, a sound I've come to know all too well, I start daydreaming about an impossible life.

I fantasize about being an influential musician and political figure. Greta Thunberg asked me to give a speech about the climate to the UN. As I walk up to the stage, I grab my zippo and light a fat blunt. In my dreams I'm a rebel after all, which is not that far from reality. My speech is short but powerful, all the cameras are focused on me. As my speech comes to an end, I get influenced by the spur of the moment. ""The time for words has long since past, words evidently get us nowhere. It's time for actions, and with these words, allow me to be the first one to put them into action"" I walk up to Trump and bitch slap him right across the face.

Rumbling. Oh right, my stomach. I wake up from my fantasy, hungry and alone. Guess it's about time to make a sandwich, maybe I'll treat myself to an apple as well, after my meal I will practice on my guitar. Some days I volunteer at a concerthall as a bartender, it makes me feel less useless and alone. Even though I actively avoid trying to make friends, it's nice to talk to people. My fellow volunteers don't think very highly of me, to them I'm just another lonely soul looking for some friends. They don't know that I despise most of them, just like I despise myself.

Those who aim for succes will have my respect. You're doing something that I dream of everyday. I'm not envious, nor am I spiteful that it's them and not me. They put in the effort, something I find incredibly hard to do. Maybe someday the tables will turn, maybe my unrealistically big dreams can become reality. Of course that will only happen when I find the motivation to be better. And with this debt crushing my self esteem, I deem it impossible, for now. I'll probably start dealing drugs in 2020, I genuinely don't care about what others think of me, I just want to pay off this debt.

Well, enough about me. Now on to the main point I want to address. 

I can smell you thinking: 'wait that wasn't even related to the point you we're trying to make?'

Well yes, but actually no. I just had to get that off my chest, which is what this subreddit is for right?
Told you it was going to be a wild ride. 

Anyway, on to the topic of corporate greed and the whole sterilized generation thingy.

F.U.C.K. Corporations. Well most of them atleast, there are some that aren't as evil as the others cough, tesla, cough. But in general, fuck em. Their greed, pride and lust for power is destroying the planet. Cutting down the Amazon, driving animals to extinction, polluting absolutely everything that isn't already polluted. Will there be no end to this? Entire ecosystems are collapsing for what? For a fairytale of eternal economic growth? For a dream of becoming the first trillionaire? For nothing but sheer disregard for their home planet perhaps? Only time will tell how far this goes. 

Why is nobody stepping up? Why do we have to depend on a 16 year old Swedish girl with Aspergers who is trying her absolute hardest to be heard. Everyone nods their head along like a good little slave but nobody dares to defy their corporate masters. After all the cash must flow, just like the pollution, just like the sands of time. But we're running out of time if you ask me. I'm by no means an expert. I'm simply an innocent bystander, someone who hasn't been chained yet, intelligent but uneducated. Too prideful to work at McDonald's. Not beaten into submission, but beaten into defiance. I'm watching from the sidelines while the world burns and it's people are falling one by one in an online trap. A trap to which I've fallen too. 

We are being hardwired to be lonely, programmed to be depressed. Sterilized with infinite entertainment just the click of a button away. Why socialize when you can watch Netflix? Need a friend? Pewdiepie. Horny? Pornhub. Want to feel accomplished? Videogames. Need external validation? Instagram. Want sum fuck? Tinder. All our wants and needs are simulated on the internet. We are still in the phase where we feel kind of dissatisfied with the online equivalent to our real life needs, but Gen Z is starting to get it. Give it 20 years and the generation then won't even know something else existed. I'm a millennial, born both too soon and too late. Doomed to be eternally dissatisfied with my fate. Well atleast a loser like me is. I don't speak for the succesful people out there. But us losers? Yeah we're fucked. 

I wish I had the guts to step up. I fantasize about assassinating corrupt politicians. Will that ever happen? Probably not. I'll be dead before then, it'll be homicide or suicide. Still, I don't want to die just yet, I want to see what the future has in store for me. After all I'm still only 22 years old. Only time can tell how this all turns out. One thing that I know for certain is that the future will either be extremely peaceful, or extremely bloody. There is no middle ground anymore. It feels like humanity is balancing on a razor. On one side, a blood soaked flower field, on the other side a bustling city filled with screens. I'm all alone and terrified, my stomach is rumbling again.","2019-12-12 15:55:27","47","10","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/e9pcxe/i_feel_like_a_whole_generation_is_being/","True","Throw-away-Like-Me","1747940853.9120471","our planet is dying","manual"
"eh1xsy","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","We weren't supposed to know that everything that exists will one day be gone. Knowing that, no matter how advanced we become, there is zero chance of long term survival for ANY lifeform because the universe will inevitably fail to support life one day. We were never meant to know this.","Knowing that every form of life will eventually cease to exist, not individually, but collectively, is the single greatest anxiety inducer in the world to me.  Nothing we do really matters because one day the universe will effectively die and there will be nothing at all we can do about it.

Sure, humanity will most likely be long gone by then and probably replaced with some other species on some other planet in a different galaxy by then.  That species will eventually die out too, and it will be replaced with something else in some other part of the universe.  

Sure, we could potentially develop the technology to leave the planet.  We could hypothetically develop the technology to colonize other galaxies.  

But that doesn't matter either, because eventually the universe itself will wither away into a dark cold abyss filled with nothingness with no possibility of forming new stars or any new source of energy or life because entropy is a bitch.

One day history will cease to exist. 

Having kids won't matter.

Freedom won't matter.

Skills, knowledge, it won't matter.  

The greatest heights and the lowest of lows known throughout human history, from the 7 wonders of the world to space travel, will eventually become meaningless.  

And that's scary.  We, as humans, as animals in a world doomed for extinction, weren't meant to know this.  We were meant to live our lives blissfully unaware of the inevitable and eventual fate that awaits us.  At least once every few weeks or so, I'm hit with this realization and it's fucking depressing beyond anything I've ever felt.  It feels like helplessness.  And sorrow.  And anger.  I'm not sure what I'm mad at, maybe the universe for teasing us with something so beautiful, only to rip it away in several billion years.

I sincerely hope science comes to some great realization at some point that grants us a future.  Not just us, as animals on Earth, but us as in every lifeform that has ever existed anywhere or will come to exist in any place in our universe.

Maybe one day science will realize that our universe is also one of many trillions, coming and going sporadically.  Maybe our universe is just an atom in a much larger universe, and maybe the atoms of our universe are their own unique tiny universes.  Maybe this continues forever.  

Maybe science is wrong.  Or maybe we really are doomed.  I hope we're wrong.","2019-12-29 05:11:53","1","8","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/eh1xsy/we_werent_supposed_to_know_that_everything_that/","True","Gotitaila","1747940876.092602","our planet is dying","manual"
"e6qo8r","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","idk where else to put this or what to do with myself","My life is good, I'm lucky and privileged to be where I am.

I attend one of the best public research universities on the planet, in a really small STEM field. I take every opportunity I get and managed to find a way to incorporate my love of writing with STEM and try to help people in need. I'm doing well in my classes and as of this semester, most of the rest of college is paid off for me through scholarships with a guaranteed job opportunity after I get my degree (I hope my honesty here doesn't ruin my chances for that later). My family are first gen immigrants to both Brazil and later America where they worked hard to secure a living and a life for my sister and me.  We are decently well off financially, but I try to find happiness without their money or support since I moved away.

When I was 16 I tried to kill myself multiple times. To this day the thoughts hardly ever leave my head, and I fantasize constantly. But I'll never do it, I've been almost over that edge and realized it's not gonna help anyone, just hurt everyone and I can manage to get through life and try to help people even if I'm sad. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and have been treated since. My psychotropic meds helped me adjust my life immediately following the incidents, but by college I was taking 4 pills everyday to get by and I felt gross and empty. I wanted to be normal and self sufficient, and it's not like the suicidal thoughts had gone away anyway, I just wasn't ever gonna act on them.

I tried to get my pilot's license which woudlve been a dream, but if any government person reads this, I lose the chance to ever. By being honest about my mental health, they wouldn't allow me medical clearance to fly. Fine enough I suppose.

I tried to be a track and XC runner for years in high school but my asthma put my in the hospital multiple times so I stopped trying. Same story with wind instruments. Bummer.

I was single my senior year high school for a couple months, and had been since I was 16 and a particular bad experience with an ex almost landed me in a psych ward. I didn't have any plans to be with anyone, and it wasn't something I ever considered doing again. This girl started texting me and I guess we hit it off, soon enough we were together and later dating. She would become my partner of 2 years now, I felt a fire and connection with her that's indescribable.

It was a fiery love, and when we were together nothing else mattered to us. All the worldly stressors lifted from my shoulders when we embraced. There were problems though.

Her family was similar to my ex's family, traditional, protective, religious. It scared me bc of my past experience, and really I should've stopped when during our senior trip, she left me alone at a Disneyland for 7 hours. Ya boo hoo sob story, but it hurt my feelings a lot. 

I had to take her home from prom at 9:30 pm. We had planned a star wars theme, seeing Solo opening night and watching the stars after driving to a mountaintop with a view. She hadn't cleared it with her parents and for their good faith, I took her back home and was sad, frustrated, and alone.

Getting into college was exciting, finally had the chance to leave and change my life, start completely fresh and new somewhere else, somewhere amazing. I was going to be parting ways with my partner who was only allowed to apply to two colleges: her older brothers and UCLA. I tried suggesting community college because it would be cheaper, she wouldnt have to commute almost an hour each way, and it would open up more doors and opportunities for her than what she got, which I knew she could do better than. Call me an asshole, I was just concerned that her parents were controlling her and not letting her leave and fulfill her capabilities. 2 years at a cc then anywhere she wanted vs 5 years at a meh school and she would be stuck at home til her mid twenties. 

I also didn't want to do long distance, but it would be hard and worth it I thought. 

She never visited me until just recently. I always had to come back home to see her, I didn't end up doing much fun stuff or going out bc it was more important to me to be at home and get a chance to be with her. I had a place all my own over summer, and she was free and I wanted to try and sort out a trip for us together, thinking we could figure anything out together through our undying love and mutual support for our relationship and future. 

She rejected the offer for months. Around January I had started dabbling in psychedelics as medicine and treatment for my mental health instead of my medications. They worked wonders like I couldn't believe. For the first time in years I felt capable, self sufficient, proud of myself and understanding and forgiving of my family and myself. 

My grandfather died in March, I went home to give his eulogy and carry his casket, and she was missing from the whole ordeal because some classes were more important to her than I was. That hurt me a lot. I hardly made it through my first semester, but by April this year I was committed to working hard and kicking ass, and I did. I got the support I needed, and she wasn't the one who provided it. I'm ok with that and proud of myself. I've been kicking ass since, I have good work habits, found passion in my work and in fighting for socioeconomic justice and climate activism. I made great friends that are supportive and genuinely love me, and the feeling is more than mutual.

Being rejected over summer and losing that opportunity for us to get away hurt a lot. I expressed wanting to end it given all the circumstances. She never visited me, supported me, or tried to be with me more than the couple times I come home a year. Even then, she had a curfew that I wanted to respect. 

Yet, I still hadn't met her parents, I still couldn't have her over for a night, I still couldn't take her out dancing or to late night movies. I couldn't share the college life and its freedoms with her, and it made me sad.

In trying to split, we agreed to open the relationship and try to make it work. I met a beautiful woman who was a free spirit like I hadn't ever seen. She was wonderful and we greatly enjoyed each other's company. I ended it with her after my partner expressed her true feelings about it, and haven't been with anyone else.

She on the other hand, was meeting and exchanging nudes and fantasizing about being with other men. It was fine, fun and exciting and I was glad she seemed eager about it. She continues to see and be with other men even now, after I had to cut things off with the other woman because we decided to take a break from labels and find ourselves.

I worked on myself and applied my time to being vegetarian and vegan as often as I could. I spent much needed time with friends and hours and hours working. I'm doing great this semester technically, but feel so completely shitty bc of my partner.

She gaslights me and talks about how I dont appreciate the sacrifices she makes in defying her parents when she finally came up to see me recently. How I don't appreciate all she does for me and how i never listen to her problems.

It hurts a lot and I know none of it is true, or at least not entirely. How do I show my appreciation for her sacrifices other than staying with her trying to make it work? Am I having to be grateful for having to had wait 2 years for this? I always have an open ear and a supportive embrace and caring words for her I think. It doesn't seem to matter 

Nothing really does 

I feel like I can't help people or the planet, the more I learn the more I realize how fucked it all is. Over summer, to cope with my pains, I began drinking a lot and got addicted to it. I would drink and then do other drugs I wouldn't have normally done because I lost my inhibitions. My issues with substances have continued on into the semester, but my drinking has gone from a lot daily to a little every weekend or other week.

I still love and stand by psychedelics but my journey with them has been complete, and I now just share that experience with people and sometimes continue to use to find myself in dark times. I can't know if it's good or not, especially with all the research and legislation being passed now and in the future.

I've been seeing a therapist for 3 years and have been very open about it all, and he keeps me standing.

My relationship with my mother is very volatile because she's very ill, and my life get difficult and meaningless when I'm facing emotional pains from the two women I care most about in my life.

Sorry for the long post and also I'm on mobile so weird formatting maybe etc etc. Thanks.

TLDR: addicted to drugs, feel stuck in a toxic relationship, attending excellent research university with great friends but still sad boi","2019-12-06 00:39:47","2","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/e6qo8r/idk_where_else_to_put_this_or_what_to_do_with/","True","Shmandeltoid","1747940921.016715","our planet is dying","manual"
