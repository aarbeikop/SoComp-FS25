It is a story about how a high-tech solar cell R&D quit a well-paying job and learned sustainable farming starting from zero. It is also a story about a guy backpack traveled across almost whole central Europe and was willing to settle down on his little organic garden. (Check out my travel pictures at: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100007398167578&sk=photos&collection_token=100007398167578%3A2305272732%3A69&set=a.1535312540058670.1073741831.100007398167578&type=3) 
The most frequently asked question is “why? or are you out of your mind, why?” The answer is simple, I’m an true idiot,ha. 
I am stupid enough to believe that I might be able to stop the global warming if I could get more people’s awareness. Mother Nature picked me to see things in my journey, the scenes that I could never forget. I saw that we’ve lost our roots, literally. We’re changing the face of the planet. ( NAZA satellite picture at http://greentrav.com/my-dream-goal/) Its natural landscapes and animal habitats are dying. And we’re not even aware we’re doing it. 
I then had a simple idea: Since global warming started with people cutting down trees, we should be able to stop it by planting trees back! 
Therefore, I quit my job and studied sustainable farming for almost two years now. I hope to carry out a design that can maybe pique people’s interest in growing plants at home and help to stop the global warming. So back to my question am I crazy?

"2urngt","vegan","unknown","Frustrated vegan","I just typed up a big vegan rant, and want to post it on facebook.  I'll probably lose all my fb friends, but it needs to be said.  I'm so tired of justifying myself to meat eaters, who couldn't care less about the animals.  Here's the post.  Hold me back, reddit, if you think it's too intense.  ;)

""Do you want to know why I’m so passionate about veganism?  Why I post all those pictures and links that make you uncomfortable, make you roll your eyes, make you angry?  Let me answer by asking YOU a question.  If you saw a cat or dog being horribly abused and mistreated, would you say something?  Most of you would say yes. To the ones to say no, you can stop reading right now.  Now, if you said “yes”, I want you to imagine if that abused, mistreated animal was a cow, pig, chicken, goat, sheep, etc. instead.  What makes the pain and suffering they are experiencing any different from the pain and suffering the cat or dog is?  Numerous studies have been coming out lately, finally admitting that farmed animals have the same or similar experiences that our companion animals do.  For example, a pig has the intelligence of a 3 year old toddler and is smarter than a dog.  So, imagine if you will, the rage and sadness you feel over seeing a cat or dog being abused and multiply that 56 billion times.  Every time I see someone eating an animal, that same rage and sadness forms inside of me.  “If you see something, say something” as the saying goes.  I am saying something.  I am attempting to cut through the mental block we have against seeing farmed animals as being more than just dinner.  

Over 56 billion farmed animals are killed every year by humans. More than 3,000 animals die every second in slaughterhouses around the world. These shocking figures do not even include fish and other sea creatures whose deaths are so great they are only measured in tons

Animals are not simply food products, but thinking, feeling individuals who want to enjoy their lives. An animal's life is as important and irreplaceable to them, as ours is to us. But as children we are conditioned to view cows, pigs, chickens, sheep and fish as inferior beings whose reason for existence is to provide us with meat, milk and eggs. This way of seeing other species is known as speciesism. It's time for us to change the way we see the other animals with which we share the planet. We need to stop thinking of them as just resources, and to start viewing them for who they are: individual sentient beings whose lives deserve to be respected and valued.

I don’t cherry pick my compassion.  No animal is more or less deserving of life than any other, including the human animal.  Baby steps are for babies.  Would you commend a serial killer for cutting back to only killing a couple people a week instead of a couple people a day?

So, if you’re so deeply offended that I remind you where your dinner came from, please, unfriend me, block me, do what you have to do to make yourself feel better, because I’ll still be here, opening people’s eyes to the horrors that they are supporting.""","2015-02-04 16:36:22","24","50","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2urngt/frustrated_vegan/","True","jadamsrd","1747837959.618966","our planet is dying","manual"
"2utl10","futurology","unknown","Future of our civilization in relation to other potential intelligent civilizations out there... precibus? cycle? whats next for us?","DISCLAIMER: Really LONG, but can contribute to an epic discussion, which is something i haven't seen in this sub-reddit in a long time.
 THERE are 200 billion-1 trillion stars in our galaxy, and there are about the same amount of galaxies out their according to our current knowledge. According to the Kepler space craft, 1 out of 5 suns have a earth like planet in the goldi-locks zone where life is possible. that's potentially 40 billion earth like planets just in our galaxy alone, and 8*10^21 of possible earth like planets in the universe. There could be billions of intelligent ET life out there that are ahead of our time.



 AS of right now, we are constantly making new discoveries at an exponential rate, and moving forward into a full digital world at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, we got political conflict and escalations with a constant threat of annihilation if a nuclear war were to begin. Along with that, we are becoming overpopulated as a species, and although we are constantly finding more and more non-renewable fossil fuels, we will eventually run out of that too, and (Electric cars cause more damage to our environment then gas guzzlers, so not a solution) . Then there's climate change, which is a very real, and potentially catastrophic issue that i believe we must solve during this century, and to do that, more and more sacrifices regarding our way of living are going to need to be made starting as soon as possible.. 



CURRENT models around the world have best case scenarios showing the average temperature of the earth increasing over 6-8F+ by the year 2100. Worst case models show the temperature of the earth increasing by over 20 degrees on average, with some areas of the united states increasing by over 30F. Although the worst case scenario probably wont happen, even 6 degrees is enough to change everything. Drought, Famine, Plagues, Wars, floods, extreme weather, increased C02 in the air, economic collapse, wars over resources that are running out, extinctions of many species of plants and animals, and much much more since one thing will consequently lead to another contributing to a vicious and rapidly-growing cycle till nature has gotten rid of its ungrateful invaders. (the cycle, there will be a point where the cycle will not be able to be stopped until nature has brought back balance to planet earth. We are killing planet earth more than we ever used to before. Think about it this way, if you were earth, and for hundreds of millions of of years, things were in general equilibrium with a balanced nature, and you were in control, till out of nowhere humans arrived and started slowly killing you off for their own benefits. Then imagine it eventually got to the point, where you're seriously dying, while the human race is increasing exponentially, and killing you at a faster and faster rate, each year while doing very little in trying to prevent much of these damages we bring upon earth. In just a few hundred years, you see how greedy and self-absorbed this species is, with little  to no regard to the world that provided them with all these possibilities. Imagine how you'd feel. 



THEN it all comes to that single point, where we are on the clock of taking the next leap forward into progression if the necessary sacrifices are met, or if the life we are accustomed too will be too much for us to agree to change, in which point nature will kill us off. its almost like it was meant to be this way, because if we can pass through this hypothetical event, it would be a new era, with even more new possibilities. World peace would be present at least for the time being, and our ways of life would quickly start to improve.



IF we were to reach this point of no return however, it could already be too late to find a solution, since too much damage would have already been done to our world as a whole. Nature wouldn't stop till the balance was achieved again. All this, is possible within the next 100 years, and although we have accepted the situation as being severe, we aren't fighting against it yet in the viscous manner that we should be.



I believe that in the next 100 years we will reach our first precipice; Where we must change as a species, or nature will bring back the balance itself by exterminating the problem. Its like, the more we discover and move forward into a world of endless possibilities at an exponential rate, the chances of us going extinct rises respectively. At the same time though, we are getting closer and closer to finding the solution, or set of solutions and necessary steps that should be taken now, to prevent us from reaching and being trapped in the vicious cycle, riddled with the potential disasters and extreme regret, and self-destruction of the human species. Its like we are in a race against time, and the timing really could not be more perfect. It will be a close one, but i personally believe to really further our chances, we have to change everything from our lifestyles, to government, and our personalities. Its almost like a cruel test that nature, or maybe even god gives to see if our selfish desires and blinding egos will be relinquished for the sake of a better future for the generations to comes, or if we are already too deep and too corrupted by our egos to be able to solve this problem before its too late. The timing really couldn't be more perfect; we are reaching a point in our civilization where we can stop this kind of a problem and many others, and at the same time we can perish. And what it seems to come down to is if we can sacrifice our way of living, for a harder life at first, but for a future that will thrive in a newly pronounced era till we reach the next precipice, whatever that may be, and have to make extremely tough decisions again for the survival and further advancement of the human species into the unknown.



HOW this relates to other potential intelligent civilizations is that they most likely evolved in a similar fashion we did, and hit this first precipice most likely around the same time we did in regards to how advanced we are, and that we will have our first run-on it in the near coming future. Many tough decisions are going to have to be made. Its almost like a very long science experiment that stretches over billions of years to see what will happen to these civilizations. Many wouldn't make it past their first precipice, if they are anything like us in regards to our human nature. 



WHAT will we do? What should we start off with? Is world collaboration and temporary peace across the powers possible? Can we change as a species in the little time we have, or were we doomed to begin with? I want you guys to try and expand on my ideas, ask questions, state out the flaws, and lets start thinking about the possible solutions and outcomes now, and what changes need to be made as early as possible for us to pass this hypothetical event. IMO, world peace and collaboration is a first must. Impossible as it is now, but with sacrifices made by everyone starting now, we may be able to slowly adapt, and for the first time in our histories put our egos aside, and pull this off for the sake of humanity as a whole, instead of being afraid to leave our comfort zones and live a more difficult life. Can our species really make the sacrifices that would be necessary, or would our pride and egos destroy us?



 IS there a second option, such as one having to do with a massive depopulation and one world order? If faced between these two options, (righteousness vs ego), would the people who make this decision choose the easier route of saving of our planet even if it would bring chaos all around, just because it would be more likely to succeed, much easier to accomplish, and benefit these officials much more without having to make much of the sacrifices that they would have to make if they went with the more difficult but righteous decision? Could the the second option be a trap like with adam and apple? How much would everyone have to sacrifice in order for us to avoid the cycle that we are exponentially getting closer to? We couldn't live in a more interesting time. With AI on the brink of its own exponential expansion, and with nature trying to get rid of all these parasites, I can almost imagine someone out there watching our planet, saying ""Let the games begin."" Facts, opinions, myths, fables, even poems. anything is appreciated. Let your voice be heard.
