What is in your view the next likely major disruption? AI unemployment? Some healthcare disruption (whether it's mainstream stem cells or just more personalized/predictive medicine)? Education? IoT? Something else?

Healthcare and education seem the most in need of disruption, but also seem to have the most inertia/incentive to not change. Energy is up there too though.

There are a few overarching themes/topics that generally dominate the conversations here, those being Automation, The Singularity, Artificial Intelligence, Basic Income, and Robots.

2. Who are the leading actors in the singularity movement? Not just frontmen or public figures, but those who make it happen.

3. How much does progress towards singularity depend on these 3 factors compared with each other - internal dynamic of technological development, individual people, economic or organisational mechanisms?

4. What are the most effective organizations in the broad transhumanist field? What made them so? How are they growing developing? Who is the most successful in their stated goals?

5. What are the best organizational models to make the progress happen in the right way?

6. What is the overall future timeline in terms of organizational change and challenges for transhumanist/singularity organizations from 2017 and until the singularity happens?

7. Who are the leaders in the transhumanist movement? How much followers to they have each?

8. What are the underused strategies that can make a huge impact for transhumanism that noone explores for some reason? What would you do (other than what you are currently doing) if you had a bit of extra resources?

9. How do you see your personal mission/goal in transhumanism?

10. Who are the most important graduates of Singularity University programs who are making big contributions to Singularity (please name those who were already active separately)?

11. What are the technologies that can provide huge results with the smallest resources invested? Are there any of them that some groups/people are trying?

"de8i6cx","t3_5usngc","5usngc","futurology","unknown","Dont know if I am too late with this, hopefully you are still answering comments...  If my vision of the future was only focused on the advancement of technology, then I certainly dont fear it (apart from Boston Dynamics, I assume you have heard of such horror). I'm particularly excited. The thought of cell restoration meaning a potential for endless life excites me, as does more immediate benefits like soon being able to skype my far flung family in a holographic environment, taking a walk through virtual tokyo together even though we could be in The Czech Republic and the States respectively.

But what of climate change? I am morbidly fascinated by what I see as a twin convergence of unstoppable forces, one being habitat destruction and the other being the technological singularity. People who argue with any degree of certainty that technology cant save us evidently havent fully grasped the significance of a singularity - namely that any limits to advancement are very likely to be beyond our comprehension. That said, that doesn't mean I am one of the far more naive people who blindly believe technology will definitely save us, even while alpha male posturing seems to be a more significant factor in deciding democratic decision making than scientific data.

So how do you see these convergence of forces? For me it seems that runaway climate change has almost certainly been triggered. The events of the last 18 months - pretty much since the Paris treaty funnily enough - cannot be ignored. All the models show we were on a road to hell on earth, which now appears to have dramatically sped up.

Do you see the technological singularity aiding is in our quest to survive the ongoing sixth mass extinction, considering I doubt we have more than a decade or two before dramatic seismic changes from our resource exploitation and over population, and considering the idiocy of so many on earth when it comes to fact comprehension and science denial? And would you expect any such benefits to aid the masses, or only a handful of powerful groups? 

EDIT: And do you expect such an advancement in technology would be able to continue - even if in our absence - should the worlds humidity levels increase to make it impossible to use energy in the way we are used to, or to survive as an organic life form without being in an air conditioned building?","2017-02-26 14:41:38","2","davyp82","1747880465.450915","our planet is dying","manual"
