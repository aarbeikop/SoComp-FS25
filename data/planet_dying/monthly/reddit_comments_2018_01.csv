But the amount of pollution per passenger-mile is much lower with buses than with cars. Not as clean as bicycles, but they're better, at least.

There's also the problem that the cost of public transport is more visible than the cost of running a car.

The problem with cars is that much of the cost of running a car is not all that visible to  its owner. Fuel costs are noticeable, repairs and insurance less so, but depreciation is seldom noticed, nor is the cost of taxes to fund the infrastructure needed to support cars. It might be that it might be useful to add something as simple as an estimate of a car's annual running cost to the MOT.
