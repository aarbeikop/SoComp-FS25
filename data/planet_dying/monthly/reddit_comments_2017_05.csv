However you are wrong about the relative contribution of methane from manure versus enteric fermentation.

I'll quote the paper titled: [Methane production by ruminants: its contribution to global warming](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/animres:2000119):

>Agricultural emissions of methane in the EU-15 have recently been estimated at 10.2 million tonnes per year and represent the greatest source. Of these, approximately two-thirds come from enteric fermentation and one-third from livestock manure.

To be fair that's limited to Europe, but [the same ratio seems to hold up in the USA too](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2017-04/methaneb.png).

"dgziyza","t3_68i54i","68i54i","conspiracy","unknown","Everyone please read this post if you were intrigued by OP. He was right about nearly everything he posted(I'm just speculative about ANY judgment day dates in general). 

Disclaimer -- I'm writing this is to hopefully reach out to someone that is searching for God or to assure people they are on the right path. I know there is no way I can 100% prove one word of what I'm saying here to any of you. There is only one other person that knows I couldn't be lying about this pre-birth experience of mine and it is my mom--

Now the reason I know OP is speaking the truth is simple. I have come to Earth from Heaven. Yes, you read that. I don't mean that in a figurative way, I mean it in the most literal way possible. For me, being there is my first memory. And no, I don't have memories as a baby, only as a small child and above (like most people) BESIDES THIS ONE. 

-Take note that I have no idea EXACTLY how time works in relation between Earth and Heaven and this memory doesn't help much in figuring that out. Two people could possibly leave Heaven at the same time, just be born on Earth 30 years apart. It could work several different ways I don't have a clue-

All of you are probably wondering what Heaven looks or feels like. Before I start with my description of Heaven please just know it is impossible to describe the scenery and feeling, no words or pictures can give its beauty any justice, and I only remember the small area that was physically around me just before I left Heaven to come here, but here goes: all I can formulate into words is the ""ground""(best way I can describe it in words) is a white with a touch of yellow light, except it is like a platform that you can walk/move on and there was a river flowing behind me. On the side of the river there was a tree. I can't give much of a description of the tree, but for the river I can. All of the scenery would make you go into awe, but this river was something else. The ""water"" was like crystal clear and infused with a subtle touch of a whitish-yellow light throughout it all and it ran for as far as I could see, pretty much indescribable outside of those words. The emotions you feel are not like here, there are other spirits that God created and you all just love everything there and each other, there was no hate/jealousy/anger. Nothing evil at all, which for some reason reminds me how the bible says Satan is the father of lies and how he was the first one to become jealous of God and rebel against him. 

Now for the rest of the memory, my departure from Heaven. Next to the river that I described above, there were multiple (I don't know how many exactly, around 10-30) of us spirits/souls lined up all right next to each other, maybe a foot in between,  with our backs to the river. The other spirits had sort of a human shape, but less defined and made of a kind of light (so it seemed). The light was different from the ground or the river as this was thicker and more of a yellow/orange mixture. I assume that I looked the same as the others that were lined up with me. As we are lined up, God himself (who I can confirm made us in his image, since we do have a similar shape to him, except the most notable difference is that He has/is made of this pure, overpowering light) started moving down the line. Right when He showed up all of us bowed down in His presence and stayed bowed down. He had a private, small exchange with each one of us even though we were all next to each other I don't know what was said to any of the others in line, whether or not He communicated telepathically or what I am not sure, but eventually He got to me in the line. He was facing me directly, but remember, we were all still bowing down. It was instinct to bow and the feeling I had from the experience was it isn't possible to even face Him, His light and presence was too overpowering. I heard his voice speak loudly to me saying, ""Goodbye my friend, this is the last time."" OR ""Goodbye my friend, this is your last time."" Both sentences have very different meanings, but personally I'm more inclined to think it is the first. at some point in our exchange, my ""hands"" were cupped and God held onto my ""hands"" and I noticed the palms of my hands kind of glowed more brightly than before, maybe giving me a parting gift. Anyway, that finishes my memory of Heaven from before I was born on this Earth.  

Eventually, I came to learn of two other people who came from Heaven with near identical REAL MEMORIES. As I said way at the beginning there is only one other person that knows I couldn't be lying about this. My mom also has a similar memory of Heaven. She also remembers seeing the tree, the river, all of it. Mind you, I told her my memory when I was a kid before she ever mentioned hers to me. She was also grouped up with other spirits, except she said, before leaving to come to Earth, ""Let's get it over with now!"" (as a warrior would before going out to battle) That leads me to believe some of us are sent here for the coming war between Light and Dark, God vs Satan. 

My mom stumbled upon a Satanic cult in Arizona in the late 80's that had 2 of her best friends at the time murdered  (which was secretly inside of/connected to the motorcycle club [dirtydozenMC](http://www.dirtydozenmc.com/new%20patch.jpg) you can plainly see the dice on their patch add up to 6 6 6). When she first figured out they were murdered she said to God, ""lead me to them"", she ended up involved more and more into hanging around this motorcycle club ""coincidentally"". Only to figure out later that they were the ones responsible for her friends' murders and not to mention figuring out there is a secret cult inside of the club. 

Now not everyone in this motorcycle club were evil/satanists, in fact, there was one of them, Jean, and he also has a memory of being in Heaven. After talking with each other Jean revealed that he had a feeling that some people in the club were going to kill him, and he said to my mom, ""You came here to get me out didn't you?"" That simply wasn't the case she was trying to figure out more about her friends's murders. This was all just a very brief overview of my mom's experiences, she always says ""Arizona was the testing ground"" after she went on a small adventure with a friend to see ""the petrified owl"". Oh did they find it, except it was in the form of an old rusty bus with an owl on the back of it(owl statue in bohemian grove reference anyone?). That bus was driving on the road and looking across into the windows she could see people that actually looked like test subjects, with entirely new level of weird, grotesque things on face. She doesn't go into a lot of detail on that one, but all of this ""Arizona testing ground"" theory is feasible because of how crooked, who am I kidding, EVIL, that John McCain is who is the senator there.Going back on track to sum up her main story, the club/cult attempted to murder her a couple times, one time she was reading the bible sitting in her house where she was in sight of one of her windows and then out of no where feels a push and ends up on the floor crawling into a corner. As she is still reading the bible a gunshot goes off right outside her house. This was in an almost entirely elderly community, just absolutely out of the norm. If I recall correctly it was either Jean but it could have been one of the other ""not evil"" club members lets her know that some of the evil cult members were wondering, ""Where does she get what she got and how to bottle and sell it."" When it is just God, and he isn't for sale, loser satanists. So after enough of all this she headed back to Wisconsin, may I add the police pulled her over on the drive back saying there was a report of dead bodies in her trunk. When she left Arizona in the early 90's she lost contact with Jean unfortunately.

These experiences show you there is a war between good and evil, just know there are soldiers here for the good side too. 
Remember that every time Israel goes against God they always get punished such as losing wars, or going into slavery. But when Israel follows what God commands they win their battles and prosper. It really is an easy equation. Same goes for each individual.

Lastly, I affirm Muslims believe that Isa/Christ is coming back to defeat the anti-christ. Judaism(synagogue of satan) hates Isa/Christ, who, at the very least is a prophet, any observer can tell you that. Judaism is the odd one out of Islam, Christianity, and Messianic Judaism (the real Judaism, not the synagogue of satan)","2017-05-01 14:49:43","9","mochi7","1747885861.21858","our planet is dying","manual"

This is how we know if they have the Spirit of God: If a person claiming to be a prophet acknowledges that Jesus Christ came in a real body, that person has the Spirit of God.  But if someone claims to be a prophet and does not acknowledge the truth about Jesus, that person is not from God. Such a person has the spirit of the Antichrist, which you heard is coming into the world and indeed is already here.

But you belong to God, my dear children. You have already won a victory over those people, because the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world.  Those people belong to this world, so they speak from the world’s viewpoint, and the world listens to them.  But we belong to God, and those who know God listen to us. If they do not belong to God, they do not listen to us. That is how we know if someone has the Spirit of truth or the spirit of deception.

Now every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival.  When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.  Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends.  When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him.  After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.  And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.  When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.”  He said to them, “Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” But they did not understand what he said to them.  Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. His mother treasured all these things in her heart.  And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor.

You talk about Christians and Moslems and Jews and this big role they've had in history and the big role needed in the near future. 
You talk about how humanity needs to come together - but - in all your story you simply decided to leave out the *majority of humanity* out as if they don't even matter. 

So in ancient times, there was these Jewish tribes and Christ came to them, to the people in the desert - where no one lived? Because of his cosmic mission, but decided not to go to China, where everyone lived? Or to India where all the culture was? 

The vast majority of people, and culture where in China and India and they for some reason didn't needed to be saved? What about Daoism?  and Buddhism? These teachings existed 1000 - 500 years before Christ even appeared. 

*The teachings of Jesus are just Buddhism.*

What about Brahmanism a religion of thousands of years before Christ?

What about Krishna? Doesn't matter?  

Then what about Zoroastrianism? 

What about the Quetzalcoatl? 

The mayan Kukulkan?

Like these cultures don't even matter and need not to be saved, or addressed? Don't play any role in your story?   

In your call for humanity to unite you literally left out the majority of humanity.

How do you incorporate the incredible amount of knowledge that exist - and has existed - in the world for thousands of years into your StarWars? 

Not that I don't believe your story - sure it could be real. But why your exclusive emphasis on the Abrahamic world?

Religion doesn't want the later, that would spread us too far to control.","2017-05-01 13:10:44","3","Theres_A_FAP_4_That","1747885861.256743","our planet is dying","manual"

I danced in the morning when the world was young 
I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun 
I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth 
At Bethlehem I had my birth 

Dance, dance, wherever you may be 
I am the lord of the dance, said he 
And I lead you all, wherever you may be 
And I lead you all in the dance, said he 

I danced for the scribes and the Pharisees 
They wouldn't dance, they wouldn't follow me 
I danced for the fishermen James and John 
They came with me so the dance went on 

Dance, dance, wherever you may be 
I am the lord of the dance, said he 
And I lead you all, wherever you may be 
And I lead you all in the dance, said he 

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame 
The holy people said it was a shame 
They ripped, they stripped, they hung me high 
Left me there on the cross to die 

Dance, dance, wherever you may be 
I am the lord of the dance, said he 
And I lead you all, wherever you may be 
And I lead you all in the dance, said he 

I danced on a Friday when the world turned black 
It's hard to dance with the devil on your back 
They buried my body, they thought I was gone 
But I am the dance, and the dance goes on 

Dance, dance, wherever you may be 
I am the lord of the dance, said he 
And I lead you all, wherever you may be 
And I lead you all in the dance, said he 

They cut me down and I leapt up high 
I am the life that will never, never die 
I'll live in you if you'll live in me 
I am the Lord of the dance, said he 

Dance, dance, wherever you may be 
I am the lord of the dance, said he 
And I lead you all, wherever you may be 
And I lead you all in the dance, said he","2017-05-01 15:45:47","3","AlexPurr","1747885861.259627","our planet is dying","manual"

Around 2012 I had a massive awakening and started to investigate all kinds of things - ufos, ET's, NWO, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc. The global Satanic cults/pedo rings, etc. I was banging on to my friends about pedogate long before everyone else. I also began to get very interested in the esoteric and spiritual elements. Having always been more or less atheist, that stuff began to really confront me. 

You have tied together many years of research and rumination in a manner that I wholeheartedly believe. You are speaking truth, I believe. So thank you. ","2017-05-18 11:24:10","3","[deleted]","1747885861.263558","our planet is dying","manual"

I don't have any comments for this particular thread but I was just wondering if you could make a new thread like this one with all of the info you posted on Twitter. It's really difficult to follow your Tweets because of Twitter's layout, especially if you're stuck only using a phone to read them. It would be great if you (or someone else) could condense them into one post. Just your recent tweets you made in the last few days
