"cviviio","t3_3miiq4","3miiq4","environment","emotional","Gavin Schmidt, the current director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) commented on the 51 percent claim by Goodland and Anhang on the climate science outreach blog realclimate.org, where he notes: ""The report linked is nothing to do with the World Bank, rather it is a report from World Watch Institute – which I assume is some kind of NGO. Regardless, the reported numbers are nonsense – for instnace [sic], they count respiration as emissions (which makes no sense at all), and make a lot of unsupported assumptions. - See more at: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/07/unforced-variations-july/comment-page-4/#sthash.G9SihKot.dpuf""

Goodland and Anhang argue for using the 20 year GWP instead of the lower 100 year GWP, but they admit without explanation in their original paper that they only adjust the methane from livestock using the higher conversion factor to CO2 equivalent (the remaining adjustment for the remaining 63 percent of methane from sources unrelated to livestock is trivial, but would reduce the total share attributable to livestock). And not only do they include respiration, but they quietly ignore the estimate provided by the FAO in Livestock's Long Shadow, opting instead to (incorrectly) use a back-of-the-envelope estimate from a non-peer-reviewed editorial by Alan Calverd to obtain an estimate three times higher, which they further inflate by adjusting for increases in tonnage of livestock products nine years after the reference year (2000), without making similar adjustments for subsequent increases in emissions related to the energy sector.","2015-09-30 02:43:12","2","OnceJolly","1747849228.4031732","our planet is dying","manual"

Millions and millions of bison roaming the great plains of North America for thousands of years never caused an issue, while they were feeding on grasslands which acted not only as a massive carbon sink but which supported a massive, diverse ecosystem that is now largely gone, and have been replaced with petrochemical-reliant farmlands for less nutrition crops.

"cve79gm","t3_3mdx9w","3mdx9w","vegan","unknown","Your reasoning is insanely weak and fails to consider the basics of economics - anything that you are calling a ""by-product"" still contributes to the profitability of the meat industry and incentivizes the slaughter of cows.

We aren't plains indians, slaughtering bison where the question is use the skin or don't use the skin. Cows are treated as commodities, and they have largely fixed production costs - raising a calf, feeding it, providing it with medical care and shelter for 2 years costs a rancher several hundred dollars. He then sells that cow to a processing facility and recieves money for it. The processing facility is able to sell most of the parts of the cow, for beef, for gelatin, for pet food, and for leather - the aggregate of all of these is their profit. 

If we all, as a society, stopped buying leather, the profitability of processing a cow would go down, the facility would pay the rancher less, and because raising a cow is a fixed cost, the ranchers profit goes down. If it becomes sufficiently not profitable, he stops raising cows and grows soy beans, or some other economically sensible thing.","2015-09-25 21:33:22","14","satosaison","1747850335.8544471","our planet is dying","manual"

Others have touched on it, but there are two factors. One is that you're making the industry more profitable by buying their byproduct. It might be better in the short term to 'not waste the rest of the animal', but in the long run it's better to do everything to decrease demand. Furthermore, as someone else brought up, you're contributing to a culture of using animals for their products rather than respecting them as sentient beings.

I think the best thing you can do with leather that you already own is to give it away to someone who would otherwise buy more, but I'll admit I haven't taken the initiative to do so myself.","2015-09-25 22:04:02","4","[deleted]","1747850335.860078","our planet is dying","manual"

In general, it just promotes unnecessary exploitation. It promotes the idea that we should take advantage of animals when we shouldn't. We shouldn't wear leather just because we want to. And it promotes the idea that killing animals is okay if we use all the animal. It isn't.

But it gives these companies profits still. So **you are still supporting animal cruelty by purchasing leather**. It might not be their main product, but neither is gelatin. But they still make profits from selling gelatin. So even if you buy sunflower kernels with gelatin in them, you're still supporting the animal slaughter industry. [Planters doesn't get gelatin for free](http://www.hsltc.com/666_500_csupload_55643688.jpg?u=838712954), and nor does any clothing company get their leather donated to them - they buy most of it. 

> That means means we don't have to use other materials to make things like shoes and such. So that's less waste for the planet, and less wilderness being bulldozed to grow cotton for our non-leather clothing.

Skin decomposes. It's not plastic man! Leather takes around [50 years to decompose](http://www.ask.com/science/long-leather-decompose-c6ece124c2dba5a4) and become soil. It takes a person [8 to 12 years to naturally decompose](http://www.memorialpages.co.uk/articles/decomposition.php) - the skin is far from the last thing that turns to soil. Now, it could be true that their is way to much animal skin to compost, I mean... people kill a lot of animals. The manure of cows is typically great for the soil, but in the amounts we produce it? It's causing problems. That said, I can't imagine how [chemically laced leather](https://sites.google.com/site/isttschool/useful-information/chemicals-used-in-leather-processing) will be better for the soil when someone throws there leather into a landfill and it decomposes compared to raw skin. But... leather is a business and no way are butchers and animal agriculturists composting the skin - they're making money off of it. 

Anyway, my point is... I would argue that leather isn't *better for the environment* than just letting the skin decompose. That said, I've never had a discussion about this so I've never heard an opposing view, and because of this - never have really generated a sound argument on this topic.

"cve8uqa","t3_3mdx9w","3mdx9w","vegan","unknown","Thanks for all the interesting points (and thank you jbrs for being understanding).

So far, I haven't really heard an economic argument that has made sense. I don't love the idea of profits going to industries that exploit animals either, but if no one kills any extra cows for this, I'm honestly not that bothered that someone profits off the hides. And since far more cows are killed for beef (or used for dairy) than leather, that suggests that no extra cows are being killed for the leather, even if someone's pockets do get heavier. Unless someone has research to suggest that some cows are killed for leather but not used for meat — that would change my mind. Does anyone have that research?

The idea that using leather says to the world that killing cows is okay is a stronger argument. On the other hand, I'm not sure too many people see people wearing leather and think ""Well, guess it's okay I eat hamburgers."" I imagine they've just always been eating hamburgers. So, that wouldn't be contributing to more cow deaths either.

However, clearing wilderness to make other materials instead of using leather to make clothes actually IS causing a great deal of harm: to wild animals, to nature, to the planet. So that seems the strongest factor here. Unless there are other points?","2015-09-25 22:20:52","-1","we-made-this","1747850335.875396","our planet is dying","manual"
