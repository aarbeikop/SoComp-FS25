I'm all for being prepared for, or better yet, trying to prevent any doomsday scenarios, but I really haven't come to terms with what the doomsday scenario for climate change is.

I could imagine a worst case scenario that in maybe 100-1,000 years climate change has gotten so bad that islands become absorbed by the ocean, or that coastal cities are flooded and the landscape of the world as we know it is forever changed. 

If this scenario occurred I would imagine that potentially millions of people would die or be misplaced, which would be a massive tragedy, but even then, I can't imagine how it would be an existential threat to humanity.

I would assume that humans would adapt and find somewhere on the planet to survive and continue to advance humanity.. Would we not?

To me, that seems like the worst case scenario, which would not be a threat to the existence of our planet or human race, and is still a rather far-off or maybe even far-fetched scenario.

I'm not denying that climate change is real or that it may have massive consequences, but when people describe it as an existential threat, it makes me think that I'm either misunderstanding something or that it's being massively overhyped.","2019-05-08 17:37:45","14","29","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bm883r/how_exactly_is_climate_change_an_existential/","True","dandb2017","1747927926.479412","our planet is dying","manual"

My point is very simple. I have a really rational view about climate change prevention. We prevent the human kind from suffering and chaos. Food production may go dramatically down and we aren't feeding all people by the level of production today. So we will have problems of satisfying the basic needs of us all. Secondly the weather will become crazy and dangerous. The impact is not only that one million specious die. It's not altruistic it's just the logic and nessasary to lower the co2 (and other gas emissions) level on earth. I hate the spirit of saving the planet is some kind of a hippie idea, like think about the animals. Well this is a good reason too, no question, but it will affect us all in a really dramatical way.

"bqrhyb","collapse","skeptical","How many here think this culture/civilisation is worth saving?","Here comes a moderately long essay/rant. Feel free to skip it and just answer the question in the title.

&#x200B;

In my view the current global capitalist culture has in its heart on an ethos of destruction and death. Over hundreds of years the predecessors to this culture committed massacres and genocides of indigenous societies, building the current age on a foundation of broken promises and blood. The wild world is now almost entirely gone. We are now at a point where it is almost impossible to live apart from this global system, and to live in it is, for an enormous number of people, a living hell. In the first world we are trapped in a depthless consumerist rat race and plagued by mental illness, while invisible people on the other side of the world are condemned to mines and sweatshops, to manufacture trinkets that exist only to make a few people rich and satisfy noone. 

&#x200B;

And that's just what we do to our fellow humans.  We also torture and slaughter billions of living creatures for food and are slowly wiping out the remaining wild creatures through starvation, disease and poaching.

&#x200B;

The business-as-usual future, if there is one, means less freedom for all of us. Those who don't have money will be further trapped in a society that needs them only as wage slaves, data mines and bank accounts. The powerful want us to live meaningless lives in crowded cities, they want us chasing the carrot, they want us reliant and compliant. And now, after a decade of social media, they know everything about us; they are in the process of fashioning algorithms that are so targeted and nuanced that people's minds will be even more easily colonised. Screens and ads everywhere, 24/7. Who will resist? Will resistance be possible?

&#x200B;

I would argue that this has already happened. Phones, computers and social media cut us off from ourselves, each other and reality far more effectively than any despot in history. 

&#x200B;

Now, I believe life is sacred and the billions on this planet don't deserve to die, just as the indigenous victims of colonial expansion didn't deserve to die, just as the innocent victims of centuries of imperial wars didn't deserve to die. But this culture of endless growth created our doomed population for profit, and it will sacrifice us in the end like it sacrificed everything else. People in the future will look at us like we look at the victims of the black plague, the world wars, manifest destiny. That time in history that all those people died. It wasn't really our fault. We were just victims of our time and our history. It couldn't have happened any other way. 

&#x200B;

And they're right. We were born into this culture and internalised it's demented logic, and we couldn't have acted any other way. Even our 'solutions' for our current crisis only embed us further in it, putting off the collapse while destroying more life in the process. I just hope it all falls apart before they can resort to geoengineering. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, I don't think this culture is worth saving. Humanity is, but the culture/civilisation isn't.

"bubtmq","sustainability","action-oriented","Zombie State Owned Enterprises, Vampiric Corporations, and a Fossil Fuel That Refuses to Die: Why India's Reliance on Coal is Bad For India and the World"," 

Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.

Coal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).

A problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people. In theory, Coal India is obligated to provide employment to these displaced people, but has only managed to provide jobs for a small [minority](https://books.google.com/books?id=BxDKhOnWwOsC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=tribe++employment+%22coal+india%22&source=bl&ots=mKvZZWjGxn&sig=ACfU3U2jNdOszeIC3kEvO_E3Ft7pU3xKtA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwii5fKs-YPiAhUDMawKHcwOC-Y4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=tribe%20%20employment%20%22coal%20india%22&f=false), while pollution has impacted the livelihoods of many who . Many adivasi people have turned to the Naxalites, a radical and [violent ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Maoists-trigger-train-crash-100-die/articleshow/5985997.cms)Maoist terrorist group, out of desperation and many ordinary people have been [caught ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/bastar-tribals-raise-their-voices-against-naxal-atrocities-118032900569_1.html)in the [crossfire](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/chhattisgarh-activists-up-against-salwa-judum-atrocities-107090601020_1.html). While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.

India's coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States. Nevertheless, coal is likely to be king for the foreseeable future. Millions of Indians are [buying ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-in-indias-passenger-vehicle-market)their first cars every year, while India produces vast quantities of carbon [intensive ](https://www.devalt.org/newsletter/jan97/of_1.htm)products such as cement and steel. Most importantly, coal consumption is rising rapidly in India. The International Energy Agency projects coal use in India will [increase ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/iea-china-and-india-to-fuel-further-rise-in-global-coal-demand-in-2018)from 563 to 708 million metric tons, with total coal consumption increasing by more than 3% a year. Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015. India [emitted ](https://www.axios.com/china-india-us-pushed-carbon-emissions-to-record-levels-in-2018-1b1e171a-d46a-49b7-bc4a-7250942a1a7d.html)2.6 billion of the worlds total 15.3 billion . While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.

India's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.

I was suicidal for 3 years, tried to kill myself on numerous occasions and always failed. And finally, after 2 years of therapy and changing my surroundings, I've found the will to live. I want to learn new things, travel places I've never been, become a better person, and grow old with someone I love. I'm only 19, but I have such big plans for my future. I finally feel like I want to fucking live. But I feel as if that won't happen anymore.

I hate that I might only live until 30 something (and that is a generous assumption) because of something people who got to live out their lives put into motion. I hate that I can do little to stop it myself. I hate that even though humans as a collective COULD stop it, but can't because people are idiots, in denial, or sometimes just flat out evil. I'm in America, and watching the leader of our country do nothing but hurt this planet for business' sake feels like being I'm being put into an iron maiden. 

I have such little hope that we'll make it. I don't trust humans to band together, and even if we did the Earth will continue heating well past our lifetimes. So I can only hope that when we die, it will be quick. I hope that I can die ready. I hope I will see it coming, so I can accept it like I did when I tried to kill myself, because I think that's the most comfortable I've ever been when facing my own death on my own terms. I don't need to be in the arms of my loved ones, but if it's possible, I want to be with my family and friends. I don't want to die alone, drowning or burning. I want to die prepared. But if I can avoid it, I don't want to die at all.

Because I want to live, I still try to help this planet. I have been changing my lifestyle and cleaning up trash where I can in hopes maybe this will help somehow, but I know it's near impossible. 

If we really do die, I hope God or whoever has plans to bring our souls somewhere new to finish out lives naturally like we should have. I hope life exists somewhere else, so our Galaxy isn't just empty because we fucked it up. 

Maybe I really should of died years ago.
