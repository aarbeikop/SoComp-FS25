"4poi87","futurology","unknown","Living in the far future, what will it be like? (the far, far future)","I'd like to live in the future, anytime but now. 10 years in the future, sure. 50 years? Even better. 500 years? Now were getting somewhere.

How about 5000 years? 

**HOW ABOUT A MILLION?**

This is just a blink of the history of evolution, but how far will humanity reach by then?I think it has 3 outcomes.


**1. We die.** Simple as that. A asteroid, virus or anything like that reaches us before we can secure our position in the universe. Maybe even different branches of humans (ex. humans on mars vs. humans on earth) kill eachothers of.


**2. We stay.** Humans give up the thought of traveling out there and instead focuses on perfecting life and conciousness on earth. This probably ends with humans building a self sustaining, brain emulating supercomputer where they can store 'themselves' until the end of time, OR EVEN LONGER by slowing down time perception inside the simulation. This computer is running tens of billions of human brains. The machine is self is controlled by robots or drones controlled by the people living inside the machine. This machine is powered by solar and fusion energy as a backup and occupates about *12 000 000 000* square meters. The processors are *light based*.
The humans in the machine will experience as if they could live for n times a googol years.


**3. We venture the stars and colonise the universe**. We harness the energy of our sun (and other stars) with technology like the *dyson sphere*. As we travel and branch out to millions of planets and get more distant. This could cause wars between civilisations (this probably won't happen if we discover how to make wormholes or warp drives). If we lack the technology to get from A to B faster than light could then we would all evolve on different paths, never being able to crossbreed due to the years of travel. The human race would go on different paths.
With *wormholes* or *warpdrives* the future looks brighter. This means that we could colonise the universe in a fraction of the time. The current solar system would become a relic visited by trillions every day.

What do you think? How will humans evolve? When will these different 'events' happen?
