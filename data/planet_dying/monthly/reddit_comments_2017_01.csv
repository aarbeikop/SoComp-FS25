I lived 90% of my life NEVER thinking about vegetarianism or veganism and of ALL the things I could have thought about, food wasn't one of them.

Our society is disconnected mostly because our culture makes it 'ok' for us to eat animal products and when you do the same thing for years, it's practically impossibly hard to start thinking about something you have NEVER thought about; hence, our ignorance.

Most people I've mentioned my veganism to have just said ""oh, cool"" and left it there. The rest are generally all-round douches. Maybe I've been lucky, maybe you've been unlucky. 

I do think a good amount of vegan advocates can come off as preachy. I admit to cringing at a lot of vegans who protests at McDonalds or wear t-shirts saying ""meat is murder"". Maybe I'm just a bad person but I've never been receptive to stuff like that. 

Not that I know how to do it better, I just think a strong passion for something can blind people a little to how they come across. ","2017-01-10 04:27:57","12","fezferdinand","1747878658.738146","our planet is dying","manual"

""Hey Minivergur, I'm having a steak this evening. How do you feel about the fact that animals have to die to sustain me? Anti-vegan is the best, something something bacon.""

The thing is that he's a drug-addict on welfare and the only thing I could think was that the cow is a more productive member of society than he is.

I didn't tell him that ofcourse because he's going through some severe depression.

Funny thing is the next day some girl posted on Twitter two photos of his Tinder account where his _about text_ was ""Love all animals and a total natureboy."" and next photo was of him with his rifle and some birds on display that he had shot down. He got angry and said: ""Fucking vegans, I eat meat but I'm not like 'Hey vegans look at this meat I'm eating!'""

"dbyw67h","t3_5lu9gj","5lu9gj","futurology","unknown","I think we're living in an extremely short period of time in which the rate of progress is the fastest in history (and future). Assuming humanity will last for 10s or 100s millions of years and that progress follows a logistic curve, there's slow progress at the beginning - stone tools, fire, bronze weapons, agriculture, etc. Then it gets crazy in the last 200 years - vehicles, planes, electronics, internet, space exploration, population explosion.

Thatfast pace will last for hundreds of years with the ultimate peak at the point we have super-human AI and free energy.

Then comes a slow-down leading to a long, long age of stability with little to no development (on Earth at least). There won't be significant events for tens of thousands of years because everything will be already optimized, invented, tried. The year 484,349 will be similar to 604,549.

In the big picture, the fact that so much progress happens in just 100 years is absolutely incredible. The timeline of humanity (again, on Earth at least) is basically: slow and basic progress - super fast progress (now) - nothing interesting happens. Yeah, there might be events that change everything (aliens, time travel) but I'm simplifying and brainstorming, this is not a serious analysis.

Right now we're in a growth phase, yes, but do keep in mind that there is such a thing as physical capacity--and that exponential-like growth will make us approach that capacity faster, even though we're still quite far from it today.

Also more generally, take non-medical predictions by medical Doctors with a grain of salt.  Medicine is an incredibly deep field, which means you have to focus all your education on just medicine.  Moreover, it isn't fundamental in the same way physics is, which sometimes lets physicists get away with making out-of-specialty predictions by being sufficiently vague (aka assuming a spherical cow).
