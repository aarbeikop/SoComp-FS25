"djpfivc","t3_6kv1xh","6kv1xh","conspiracy","unknown","Our own consciousness is being hidden from us. I have recently unlocked something very large in my own awareness that makes me able to see my real self. And my real self transcends this physical plane.

I am also seeing the overall control scheme tptb implement through almost all channels of info we receive. It is very symbolic in nature and has to do with them trying to control the plane of existence slightly less dense than ours, the astral plane, our inner sense perception.

it's really more like an area of our Own Conscious Minds. People who do brainwashing and hypnosis work in this area of the mind. The astral is another layer of consciousness we are directly connected to. This is our real soul, or spirit, and our connection to our gestalt awareness. A gestalt awareness includes memories and recognition of how vast your own consciousness is.

Tptb, I should say the secret societies and the brotherhood and the illuminati are only enlightened because they hide your own enlightenment from you. They invert it, flip it, twist it and basically show you everything in a way to mock you. It's an evil trick.

Space is the astral plane. That's is a major part of the consciousness deception. The whole NASA show is completely opposite of what space is. Space is a veil and behind it is other dimensions. It's a reflection of the consciousness of dreaming. When you dream you go to another area of your own consciousness. The idea that that area is actually a Part Of Our Physical  Reality is hard for anyone to understand. A subjective area of consciousness is Space.

That's one deception, NASA, it's huge. Another is the symbolic way in which they subliminally indoctrinate the masses through art and through an intentionally dumbing down of everyone. 

Nobody is taught consciousness. Dreams, inner senses. Perception, and basically anything involved with a person's own self awareness. I see now that's because they have intentionally not wanted anyone to know who and what we are and why we are here. The reason no one can definitely answer those questions is because tptb know, and they ain't telling us.","2017-07-03 01:39:06","19","[deleted]","1747889384.926232","our planet is dying","manual"

so things have gotten wierd.  i dont plan to be drinking from the firehose, ill be sipping from a cup down the street once i see no one turned into a zombie.  

start thinking about which delivery mechanisms you are attached to, for ideas, for what you put in your body, for how you meet people, for how you consider what is good and bad.  

When you find huge forces pushing in the direction opposite to the values you determine best, start wondering, what could their possible interest be?  

And having watch the news, i personally see a force pushing for human extinction, or for the survival of 2 races in particular, the chinese and israeli zionists, and perhaps some mad bankers.  as in, i see in those particular death cults the potential for the most supreme evil.   dr strangelove would be middle school level shennanigans by comparison to what those two forces might do to the global population in order to be the last ones standing.

 Combined with my personal experiences and IDK wtf to think (well, I do, but it's not easily explained)

The three books are: Ursula.K.LeGuin's ""The Lathe of Heaven""  --- it's about ""dreams"" becoming 'real'

It was THE book that got me into scifi -- she is an amazing author (read The Left hand of Darkness if you're into ""gender rights"" .. and see if you still think the same way after having done so!)

Next is Red/Green/Blue Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson

 How the fuck this guy writes about such thinggs is mind blowing! The technology in the series *is all currently available* but the whole story is SO 'precise' that it's like the guy *lived there doing it*!

I am not yet ready to fully formulate it, but essentially it somehow comes down to the existence of several classes of technology and their interactions. 

Each class of technology follows guidelines of intelligent design (in this case it has nothing to do with ""intelligent design"" religious beliefs), it being either ""emergent"" out of nature or ""non-emergent"" out of the human condition, in both cases following certain sets of rules.

Like for example, in the broadest terms ""the human mind"" represents one class of technology and ""music"" is a representative of another class of technology and through their interaction, a new technological complex (what you call spirituality and emotion) is formed, which then generates new effects of its own.

"djphwv1","t3_6kv1xh","6kv1xh","conspiracy","unknown",">The incredible experiences reported by DMT users cannot be hand-waved away, and there does not exist satisfying scientific-materialistic theory for these experiences. 

I've spoken to a few neuroscientists who suspect that a lot of those experiences are due to what they call 'a loss of scale'. Basically your senses are designed to analyse things on a scale thats relevant to you, to help you in your daily life. You don't need to view things at the scale of an ant, or a planet, that's not going to help you stay alive. 

But if you give someone something like, say, ketamine? Well they'll tell you that they just spent half an hour living in the world of the light switch. There was an entire *world* on that light switch! but the drug wore off and now its gone?

That makes sense though when you consider the scale on things universally. On a scale of planck to universe, we are extremely large. If we were smaller, we'd probably agree that the light switch is indeed a world of its own. So the drug just lets use escape our extremely limited perception for a short while. 

But when you start viewing things from such wildly different contexts, the world turns out to be far different from the way you typically view it. Things aren't really distinct from each other at all. All people, things, objects etc are like variables in a chaotic and dynamic system. They aren't individual really, they are massively intertwined with all the other variables, interconnected at a fundamental level. In the abscence of the system, they break down. 

So it isn't surprising that people see an interconnected reality... because that's exactly what reality is, even according to science. 

>Then we have the stifling of DMT research along with it's illegality around the world. Why does the scientific community for the most part ignore DMT? Why is it banned in so many countries? 

It's illegal for the same reason as all other durgs are illegal: control of power. 

>Of course not, which is why no scientific theory predicts dreaming.

Modern neuroscientific thinking *does* predict dreaming. You can't turn a brain off (well... you can, it just results in death), so it instead has a default resting mode. Like any system is needs to remain in constant motion, kind of like alpha waves when you rest. The brain just kicks into rest mode until it needs to do something. 

But the brain does more than just wait, it has to do a lot of shit, even when sleeping. It continues to process information, which is why sleeping on a problem can actually work, your brain can literally solve problems in its sleep. If consciousness is an emergent phenomenon, then there's no surprise that a still-active brain results in often fragmented and disjointed conscious experience while asleep. 

TL;DR, You can imagine yourself doing things without doing them, when your asleep those mechanisms don't stop because it'd kill them, therefore you keep experiencing them. 

>Doesn't it seem odd to you that one of the most remarkable experiences which is reported by millions of people worldwide and throughout history is largely ignored?

Not really. 

AFAIK when a person is about to die their brain dumps shit tons of neurochemicals all at once. Some of these chemicals will fuck you up (in a good way hopefully, event DMT occurs endogenously IIRC). When people die, experience the crazy brain dump, then come back, it's not surprising that they recall some crazy-as-fuck shit... because their brain gave them one mother of a high. 

>In short, something fishy is going on. 

In the case of UFO's i do agree. 

>The fact that sounds make us feel emotions is so inconceivably bizarre I have to wonder why it is not brought up more in subreddits like this.

After looking at things like cymatics, or the effect of different frequencies on things like tissue regeneration, I really don't think it's shocking at all. Part of my job is studying human brain waves... oscillating frequencies. Considering that the human brain has many mechanisms at play, all involving different frequencies and waveforms, it's not surprising that sound can effect it. Especially considering we have equipment evolutionarily designed to turn sounds waves into brain signals already (ears). 

Frankly, it'd be more shocking if sounds *didn't* effect us in someway. 

Actually I think sound/frequencies/vibration/resonance is one of the things science needs a lot more of. 

>Why were we not forever doomed to live as apes? 

Complexity evolves where ever resources allow. 

On earth, resources all more complexity. 

Therefore, we evolved to this state. 

And things are not actually that ideal. The climate changes regularly, we are running out of oil, moving things to orbit is expensive, we are carbon based (which ensures that we age and die), our bodies are fragile and can only percieve a narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, the moon is slowly moving away from us and FTL travel may well be impossible.
