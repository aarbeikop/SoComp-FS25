I get why it would upset you but you also have to consider their feelings. Morality has value, but so does the relationships you have with other people. ","2017-09-08 13:37:12","5","[deleted]","1747892629.032268","our planet is dying","manual"

"dmg2x6e","t3_6xhm98","6xhm98","conspiracy","unknown","“…by the madness which interrupts it, a work of art opens a void, a moment of silence, a question without answer, provokes a breach without reconciliation where the world is forced to question itself. What is necessarily a profanation in the work of art returns to that point, and, in the time of that work swamped in madness, the world is made aware of its guilt. Henceforth, and through the mediation of madness, it is the world that becomes culpable (for the first time in the Western world) in relation to the work of art; it is now arraigned by the work of art, obliged to order itself by its language, compelled by it to a task of recognition, of reparation, to the task of restoring reason from that unreason and to that unreason. The madness in which the work of art is engulfed is the space of our enterprise, it is the endless path to fulfillment, it is our mixed vocation of apostle and exegete. This is why it makes little difference when the first voice of madness insinuated itself into Nietzsche’s pride, into Van Gogh’s humility. There is no madness except as the final instant of the work of art–the work endlessly drives madness to its limits; where there is a work of art, there is no madness; and yet madness is contemporary with the work of art, since it inaugurates the time of its truth. The moment when, together, the work of art and madness are born and fulfilled is the beginning of the time when the world finds itself arraigned by that work of art and responsible before it for what it is.

“Ruse and new triumph of madness: the world that thought to measure and justify madness through psychology must justify itself before madness, since in its struggles and agonies it measures itself by the excess of works like those of Nietzsche, of Van Gogh, of Artaud. And nothing in itself, especially not what it can know of madness, assures the world that it is justified by such works of madness.”–Madness and Civilization, Michel Foucault","2017-09-01 23:04:10","9","macronius","1747892853.386498","our planet is dying","manual"

"dmgiu7p","t3_6xhm98","6xhm98","conspiracy","unknown","The universe is the reflection of a mirror
—Śrī Ādi Śaṅkarācārya

Not-Being is the mirror of Absolute Being,
Whence is apparent the reflection of God's splendour.
When Not-Being became opposed to Being
A reflection thereof was at once produced.
—Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari

Not-Being is the Mirror; the universe is the reflection; and man
is the Personality concealed in it, like the eye in the reflection.
—Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari

Substance is in itself or implicitly Subject, all content is its own reflection into itself. The subsistence or substance of anything that exists is its self-identity; for a failure of self-identity would be its dissolution. Self-identity, however, is pure abstraction; but this is thinking.
—Hegel

"dmgvz3g","t3_6xhm98","6xhm98","conspiracy","unknown","Also the artists are all luciferians. They have sold their soul.

The reason the bible says don't be gay or don't sodomize (anal play) is because if you do so there are nerves in your anus  (root chakra) that connects to your brain (third eye/pineal/thalamus etc) that makes it EASIER to mind control people. Discovered this when I found out the elite were all luciferians and they sodomize children and sacrifice them as well as sodomize every celeb that they promote. 

Remember forces of evil and good can occupy your body. Learn about the right hand and cleanse yourself before you seek enlightenment or otherworldly help because if you don't do the cleansing you will be deceived (the common denominator among the religions they all say that in their final steps the devil would show them their greatest desires and lie)

Good post otherwise. Reminds me of when  I followed conspiracy theories and was stuck in the illusion of being focused too much on that stuff. You should turn your eyes inward.","2017-09-02 14:48:57","1","Moelah","1747892853.4233322","our planet is dying","manual"
"dmhs2wm","t3_6xhm98","6xhm98","conspiracy","unknown","You talk about decoding the Bible, then dance right into the Babylonian/Egyptian mystery sector. The ""Externalisation of the Hierarchy"" by Bailey you've linked to and derived some theories from is Luciferian. It is an accurate description about the world we are living in, and makes a convincing case for growth through pain, if you ignore the usurpation of Christ's place at the head of the Body.  But it isn't ""Christ like"" whatsoever. Mystery Babylon is defeated at the end of the Bible, remember?  

Lucifer is the illuminator, light bringer, serpent, dragon, usurper of the throne, god of the mysteries. Yes, his hierarchy has been at play on humanity, molding the new world order for his beast to take control of. The centralization of every industry, government, health organizations, banks, news, shopping, information, all of this is to usher in his coming to take the seat at the top of the pyramid. He'll come in the name of peace and bring destruction.  Offer amazing solutions to problems he creates. It is the uniting of mankind under one religion, one government, one body, one mind, with himself as the commander of that body and mind. That has been the objective of these societies from day 1. And it's nearly complete.

You say the world isn't going to end, but instead be reborn and I agree with you. Just remember that Lucifer wants himself at the helm of our reborn self, instead of Christ. And when he comes and the whole world marvels at his amazing abilities, don't fall for the bullocks.
