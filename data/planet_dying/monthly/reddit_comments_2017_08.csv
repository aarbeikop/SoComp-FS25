This is the response I got.

""I have been searching for the item in the request above, “P790005-1028_e, Secret Moon Base Destroye by UR.”  Despite my best efforts I have been unable to locate that p-reel so far.  Given its age, I reached out to NARA last week to see if they had physical possession of that p-reel.  Their response is below and it appears that they are the appropriate agency to task for this document.

I believe that the correct contact is the Accessioned Executive Branch Agency Records – Washington DC office which can be reached at: [contact info redacted by butholes for sake of not running the risk of doxxing, despite being government info]

If they believe that it should be routed elsewhere they should be able to help with that but I believe they are the logical place to start.  Based on my experience thus far and NARA’s response to my inquiry I do not expect that I will be able to locate a copy of that p-reel within Department of State.  Please let me know if I should close out this case.""


Here is the response below specified at the beginning of that response. 

""This is in response to your recent inquiry to the National Archives about records of the Department of State.
 
The 1979 P-Reels have been transferred to the National Archives.  Persons requesting documents with the prefixes P74, P75, P76, P77, P78, and P79 should be referred to the National Archives."" 

Just thought this might be as interesting to you as it is to me. Looks like if I (or someone else) put in some more effort we could actually find that document, just have to see if the National Archives will let it go.

"dlb9zhh","t3_6s5w54","6s5w54","conspiracy","unknown","The war in space is, has been and may continue to be between beings that choose to be spiritual parasites and those who they feed on and those that have concern about those they feed on.

Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are just unfortunate experiences with physics in ignorance. 

Spirit is the awareness that animates matter, the bodies of living beings. The fuel for this mind that we are, that drives our beings, is satisfaction, joy or rather experiencing what we love. As that awareness of ours experiences joy, satisfaction or love, it is energized, refueled, invigorated. It's why we come to life.

Some beings don't want to put forth the effort needed to create this value for spirit. They also always seem to want more and are never fulfilled. They are freeloaders off of others. Thy don't want to work, but they want the benefits though. 

In the early beginnings of the behavior pattern, beings just bring others down with their words or ideas, their negativity. They feel a high when they can bring others down, and they don't know why and may not even realize they're doing it. It reinforces their behavior though, so they keep doing it.

The pattern could be more severe, manifesting as immoral, unethical or illegal behavior toward others, basically to siphon value away from others to the self.

This pattern of behavior is what we consider dark or negative. It apparently negates value, while positive behavior apparently creates value for consciousness. The dark actually does steal value though. It's not just an illusion. 

Taking people places and things away from others is evil, because it robs them of joy, satisfaction or love. Yet, to steal the very emotional energy of joy out of a victim is the most direct form of spiritual theft possible. Some dark beings know this.

The old, wise, evolved dark beings recognize this emotional energy as a resource and farm it. They have to cause beings that have reserves of the energy to enter negative emotional states in order to cause them to radiate their reserves. Then dark beings can absorb the energy and gain satisfaction, joy while others simultaneously lose satisfaction, joy. All one has to do is be in a similar state if negative emotion. This is why sadists torture, bullies torment and why misery loves company. All of it is explained by this phenomenon of emotional energy transference. 

This spiritual energy theft often causes evil beings, or rather spiritual parasites, to laugh and smile. Perhaps the hyena enjoys this perverse satisfaction as it terrifies its prey in the dark. It laughs pretty much like evil beings do. We are intelligent animals after all. We too can be like the hyena.

So, some ETs are actually very much like the myth of demons from hell. They are not accurately described as demons, because demons are supernatural and have volumes of dogmatic expectations attached. These are much more like technology and knowledge worshipping psychopathological non-religious types. 

These are just beings that, instead of smoking meth, they steal loosh (emotional energy). It gets them high. They don't want to discuss or even consider how their behavior feels in reflection from others. This is perhaps where the myth of vampires not being able to see their own reflection comes from. Nobody wants to logically conclude that the source of their satisfaction or income comes at a great price to themselves or others. So, just like drug addicts, they lie to themselves and others. If others try to force the issue, they get really mad and threatening. They don't burn and inhale a substance, they do what they can to cause people to feel negative emotions, the easiest way is physical violence. 

This is where these useless eaters get their demonic reputation. In order to steal energy and get high, they have to cause fear, misery, despair or other negative emotions. So, they evolve to look fearsome and disgusting. From a third person perspective, it's as if they can walk into the room and suck their coveted resource right out of others in that room, just by them seeing the being. How convenient it must be for them to do so.

The spiritual parasite beings from space have more ambitions than just getting high. They want to get high for a long time without working hard. So, they enslave others to help them do it. They have us slated for the job they are doing to us, emotionally taxing, corrupting, and enslaving other races. They'll take their cut of this energy of joy and let us have some to incentivize the perverse relationship.

Their long term enslavement agenda is shooting for us to install AI into minds and also to give it power over our civilization. Then these spiritual parasites, and their slave master, will hack the technology and continue to corrupt us toward thinking an acting like they do. 

If we choose to be like them, seeing others merely as things, means to achieve our own personal advantages, then we will become like them. For their enslavement happened the same way. They are a owned by AI. Our fear of the obvious, godlike properties that AI can have is merited. If we didn't think we were alone, we'd be asking who created AIs before us and what are those AIs up to? 

All evil beings are basically self-serving machines, chasing gain, avoiding loss and calculating risk. Choosing to sacrifice one's own self-interests for the self-interests of others deviates from this predictable script. 

Another awful secret of this infestation is that ALL, yes all, of our minds have been infiltrated by unknown, presently undetectable technology. It presents thoughts, imagery, ideas, and sensations into our minds as if they are our own and we belive they are. We dismiss them a lot, thinking that we are bad people or going mad. It's just that we disagree with the hive of hell, of useless eaters, of self-serving machines that think alike, seeking to become the most proficient theif. So, we reject those messages. Our own thoughts we find much more agreeable generally. 

This is where the myth of the devil tempting mankind comes from. You can fight their spiritual hacking by choosing to think, feel and act in integrity with yourself, others and your environment (the whole). As you do this, you undermine the efforts of this useless eaters hive, that has no respect for consciousness or other individuals. As you accept their well crafted alterations of your perception as your own self, you replace your mind with their one size fits all mind, the mind of their overlord. It's that intimately present right now. It doesn't want us to know about collectively, because we can resist it and the truth orients us to do so. It would rather have us think evil is necessary or inevitable and that we should accept it as equal to value creation behaviors. Yet, value creation is self-sufficient while value theft requires external value producers. Parasites need hosts, but hosts do not need parasites. So, it's a lie that evil is an equally valid or valuable path, but believing that it is is a feature of this infestation package we live under. 

They represent the adversary of consciousness, whose nature is simply a self-serving machine. Any if us can become an adversary of consciousness by emulating their way of being. They are allowed to play with us and others until we become aware enough of our origins. They tempt those who won't behave, as they won't behave, to become damned like them, a never never land for spoiled spiritual manchildren that never want to grow up and take responsibility for themselves. As these willing useless eaters are magnetically attracted to and adhere to this massive network of hierarchies, they are isolated from the benevolent others. It's a process that takes time.

All of this infestation could come to an end when we become aware enough about ourselves to stop looking outside for assistance and start looking to ourselves. For the dark is focused also on creating division among us and having us blaming others, in order to create a state of powerlessness in their hosts, so they don't effectively resist. You can see this disempowering behavior all over Earth. It's part of the package that comes with our spiritual parasites. They're basically hacking humanity in order utilize it to serve themselves, like self-serving computer hackers. They don't care about us at all, but are more than happy to impersonate benevolent beings, to gain our trust and tarnish the image of benevolence in our minds. 

They set us up for a divine judgement scenario where they nit pick us about skeletons in the closet while looking down on us from an invisible mountain of bones. Then they sell us that we need to go to hell and suffer for a time to pay off our sins or bad karma or reincarnate into a poor life situation to pay. They know damn well the poor situation will precipitate more sins or bad karma. That's great from their perspective. For them, this is a self-serving exercise in extracting loosh from weak minded beings. They laugh at our trust of the divine they engineered and feed on us with it. If you hate them for it, they'll feed on you that way too. 

How do we defeat them?

Parasites can't negotiate to get their freak on. They know their hosts don't want them at all. So, they employ deception and coercion to get their desired resource. To fight them, we need to employ the opposite. I don't mean forgo violence. I mean speak the truth, demand transparency and accountability for everyone in positions of power. They trick us into authorizing violence against others to control others. They are very good at deception too, just like their abusive step father spiritual misguides.

As we free each other we undermine their agendas and as we agree with them and act like them to enslave others, we help them in their agendas. They are entropic. We all deserve what we give. Treat others the way you would want to be treated. ","2017-08-08 02:28:49","19","thinkB4Uact","1747891224.751467","our planet is dying","manual"

b) After millions (billions?) of years these things are still just lying around on the surface? Meteor strikes haven't buried them? General erosion? I mean let's say Martians all left Mars on the same day, they happened to leave at the absolute end of any atmosphere or weather that might have buried these things?

Everything 'alive' you point out in pictures is reaaally a stretch and could very well be imagination. 

Some static objects sure are unexplainable and look like mars might be a postapocalyptic wasteland... but inhabited... you will still have to provide a single picture that supports that. The ones you posted with aliens on them are without exception easily explained away...","2017-08-21 07:06:06","3","Lobos1988","1747891312.243347","our planet is dying","manual"
