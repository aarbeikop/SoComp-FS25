"b6ygq0","environment","emotional","The positive effects of a slightly higher temperature","I will cede the point that the carbon dioxide levels have risen much quicker than any time in history.  I will not however agree with the point that CO2  is somehow massively increasing the temperature.   there just isnt enough concentration of it to increase the specific heat requirements of our atmosphere by any meaningful amount.  I personally believe the increase in temperature is due to natural cycles of increase solar activity,  slight changes in the earths orbit, and the strength of our magnetic field.  (PBS Space time had an excellent video on it, you'll have to search for it)

But lets agree that it is trending upwards in temperature.   Is that really such a bad thing?     its a fact, and mandated by physics that warmer air holds more moisture, and that warmer climates have more precipitation.   As our population grows, we can all use more precipitation. This is clearly evident by the slow greening that's currently occurring in africa. A wetter warmer climate has had positive effects there.    Secondly, plants love co2! In fact many greenhouses inject co2 to increase crop yields.   More CO2 combined with a wetter atmosphere can and will lead to increased plant growth.  If you look at the ""design"" of the earth and its capability to maintain life, there is a good bit of negative reinforcement to stop things (like co2 levels) from getting out of hand.   Honestly, how much plant life would die stopped emitting so much CO2?    Honest question.   In fact hurricanes, these so called killer storms are one of them.  The oceans may get warmer but lets think in terms of BTUs (or joules if you want)... how many BTUs does it take to power that hurricane? Thats sucking all the energy and heat right back out of the oceans. Sure hurricane suck, and arent exactly good for the environment, but it is a natural mechanism.

&#x200B;

And ocean rise. Yes it is rising.  But seriously, its the boats!! all the damn boats!   (displacement lol)     Look at places like the aral sea.  The carson and humbodlt sinks completely dry. Prehistoric lake Lohontan completly baren.  The great lakes down a few inches, and the increase in hard non permeable surfaces that send water directly to the ocean. Dont forget the massive amounts of water we have pumped from the ground!   All this water has to go somewhere,  it can only be a few places.  In storage, in animals/plants, in the atmosphere, or  in the OCEAN.     isnt it a natural phenomenon that when you drain huge sea's like the Aral,  the ocean will naturally rise?

&#x200B;

Now I am not advocating that we just pump whatever we want into the environment.  In fact, I believe our biggest challenge is the health of our oceans. we need to clean them up, and pronto.  I also think we need to get a grip on genetic alterations before it gets a hold on us.  But I also know that as a race, we are doing a piss poor job of getting nature to work for us.  California is in constant drought, but during the last few years of rain, 90% of the water that wasnt absorbed by the earth made its way to the oceans.    Why dont we have pipelines from  flood plains to the desert?  The pumps can be solar powered!

Anyways, thats just a few thoughts I have. I do think we need to care for and nuture our planet, but I think alot of people are trying to push an agenda using unrealistic scenarios that arent based in the facts of the world we live in.   thats all. good day.

"b4zfe4","environment","emotional","Please take five minutes of your day to read this","Dear Everyone, We, are killing our planet.
 
 
To everyone in the world. No matter what background, race, gender, sexual orientation please I am begging you to listen. We only have until 2050 until we reach runaway global warming. Once we reach that point there will be no saving us according to a study done by the UN. In the history of the world, there have only been five mass extinctions and my dear friends of the world we are in the midst of a six one. Species across the globe are dying at an unprecedented rate destroying the balance of mother nature. Before every mass extinction in the past, there have been signs. A sudden spike in population and the mass release of greenhouse gasses. These gasses cause the earth to heat up a significant amount. This is what is happening now as we speak eat breath and go about our daily lives. The worst mass extinction to ever happen wiped out almost 95% of all life on earth. It is a great possibility that if we don’t make drastic changes soon we could break that record. We are already starting to see the changes global warming is causing. The polar ice caps have melted more in the last 20 years than in 10,000 years as proven by satellite images. Countries such as Britain are losing their water supply as drought begins its slow coil around the world. Projections hypothesize that Britain could run out of water in the next 20 years. South Africa has faced similar difficulties. Last year South Africa’s capital Cape Town faced a drought after three years of low rainfall. The city was months away from running out of clean water. The crisis in Cape Town was barely avoided by extreme water regulations and heavy rains. Australia faced a similar threat last year as well as California and many other nations and states. This is not an issue that only concerns some. This is an issue that concerns us all. It is time to declare a worldwide state of emergency, it is time to set aside our differences, it is time to lay down our weapons of war and try to save our planet. If we do not act now we. Will. Die. At this moment in time, we have the opportunity to bond together and do something that has never been done before. We have the opportunity to save our planet. So please I am begging you for your sake and the sake of our world please stop using and doing things that can harm our planet. You may think to yourself ""oh it's, one bag"". That one plastic bag can take up to 1000 years to completely decompose. That one plastic bag will be around for generations. That plastic bag will end up in our ocean and harm the life within it. One plastic bag can cause a lifetime of damage. My fellow inhabitants of earth I am pleading with you to stop using plastic and fossil fuels. Life does not depend on fossil fuels’. At this moment in time, Spain is trying to shut down its coal facilities while also providing clean energy and providing jobs for the coal workers. Germany has done a very similar thing. They have shut down all of their coal plants in a hope to end climate change. Countries can run on clean energy. Albania, Iceland, Paraguay, and Norway run entirely on clean energy. Other countries also run on clean energy but not nearly enough to power their vast cities. Some clean energy producers are solar panels, windmills, and geothermal plants. We also need to decrease the amount of meat that we eat. The meat industry is one of the largest producers of greenhouse gasses. I promise you that you will be able to cope with fewer meat products. I am by no means saying that we need to stop eating meat altogether. I am saying that we need to significantly cut down our meat intake. We need to start protecting our planet. Because once the damage is done we cannot reverse it. You need to make a choice on whether you want to make your life easier for a few moments by using plastic bags and cause a lifetime of pain for other creature or the downfall of the human race. We need to all collectively agree that using these harmful objects while convenient at the moment cause a great deal of inconvenience in the long run. Will this be an easy task? No. This will take a great deal of work and effort on our part. Changing the ways we run our lives will be no easy feat especially when we have grown accustomed to the way we work. But if we do not act now we will kill our planet. like an old dog set in its ways, It will be difficult to learn how to clean up our mess. But if we do not do this the fate of the world is in our hands. So, make the choice to put aside your prejudice’s and hate to come together and save this lovely planet we call home. “Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.” – Winston Churchill.

"b4si2z","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I think I'm on the edge of a breakdown due to external shit and what may be mental illness so here's some vitriolic rambling crap","In the recent past, I have lost friends, pets, and my father, the latter of which I watched decline very quickly after a cancer diagnosis. He had lung surgery and needed a device to drain fluid. It was broken. It was broken from the goddamn outset, but the hospital would not give him a new one because insurance said he was only allowed to have one, ever. IT WAS BROKEN. IT WAS FUCKING BROKEN. His doctor stole him a new one (A DOCTOR HAD TO STEAL A MEDICALLY NECESSARY DEVICE IN ORDER TO TEND TO HIS PATIENT. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT LONG AND HARD), but it didn't matter, because it was too late by then. And anyway, they wanted him out of the hospital when he went back in, because the money is made by cycling patients through, so they pushed him out as fast as they could, so fast that his own discharge came as a surprise to him, because no one had bothered to tell him.

He worked his ass off his whole fucking life, and he was making six figures when he retired, so you fucking pricks don't sit there and tell me that only moochers complain about the state of our health care. Don't you sit there and fucking tell me that if you just *contribute* you won't have to worry. HE CONTRIBUTED. HE CONTRIBUTED YOU FUCKING FUCK. You're going to meet his fate, do you understand that? If you don't get on board with reforming things, then it doesn't fucking matter how powerful you think you are right now, you little shit. It doesn't matter how much fucking money you make. THE FUCKING DEATH PANELS ARE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DO YOU HEAR ME? YOUR CADILLAC PLAN WILL DENY YOU SOMETHING YOU NEED SOME DAY FOR SOME BULLSHIT REASON AND YOU WILL FUCKING DIE YOU SELFISH SHORT-SIGHTED JACKASS, YOU WILL FUCKING DIE. I wish I could be there, hovering over you, spitting in your face and telling you that you were part of that, that you could have lived if only you hadn't been a selfish fuck, telling you that you deserve it, that you're reaping what you've sown. I wish I wish I wish.

My spouse is in the hospital. My spouse will die years before me. I don't know when, but I know how, I know it's coming, and you fucking failed at that too. You failed to give decent health care even to your soldiers, whom you vapidly praise. You stick ""support the troops"" stickers on your fucking bumpers and support politicians who babble on about defense but you don't give two shits about them. If you did, you'd want them to live once they got back here, but you don't. You don't. You turn the other fucking way, because it's all just posturing and social competition, and the idea that a veteran could suffer challenges your assumptions and your childish belief in a just world, and you tell yourself that those who can't make it don't deserve to make it, because if you didn't tell yourself that then you'd have to wrestle with the possibility that whether or not you're ""okay"" doesn't have as much to do with whether you're a good, hard-working person as you've always believed. And if that's so, then maybe, just maybe, you aren't actually a good person. Or, more charitably, maybe you'll never actually be a fucking millionaire, you stupid, useful cunt. You'll never be powerful. Maybe your masters are laughing at you behind your back.

I hate these people who act ""woke"" but then are horrifyingly Americentric, who want everything to speak to the American experience. How the fuck can you sit there and say that you're progressive and against bigotry while demanding that people from other cultural backgrounds center American culture in their work, and castigating them if they don't? How the fuck can you say you're progressive if you're doing shit like, say, darkening up light-skinned Mexicans because you think Mexican = dark skin, while calling people who depict them with their actual skin tone as ""racist?"" Do you not realize what you are? Do you not realize what you're doing? YOU'RE THE FUCKING RACIST, YOU STUPID BITCH. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR RACISM BY PINNING IT ON OTHER PEOPLE.

I'm sick of that in general, all that shit, everyone scapegoating, projecting, what the fuck have you. You know what? It's not that women are all evil sociopaths, or that men or all evil sociopaths, or that Jews run the world; it's not globalists or blacks or immigrants or fucking anyone, IT'S YOU. YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM IN YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE. You have zero fucking perspective. The entire reason you're able to sit on twitter and whine about how afraid you are because someone \*gasp\* asked you for an interview is because nothing truly bad has ever fucking happened to you, ever. You're an entitled, privileged brat, as evidenced by the fact that you have the time and money to *sit around on twitter all day.* None of you are genuine. None of you are interested in doing the work to effect real change on the shit that matters. It's just a stupid fucking pissing contest, and you're ACTIVELY MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE REST OF US. YOU ARE CHILDREN. YOU REACHED MIDDLE SCHOOL AND STOPPED DEVELOPING. I want to drop all of you into the wilderness and force you to experience some actual fucking hardship so you can realize that your entire worldview is possible only because you're able to take advantage of modern convenience.

But how can I, how could I, when I too am sitting here, taking advantage of modern convenience? Aren't I the very thing that I hate? How can any of us critique anything, when all of us are covered in sludge?

I am losing my ability to be reasonable. I get in fights more often. I keep them away from the people I love, but compartmentalization can only go so far. I feel the pressure building in my  head, behind my eyes. I look forward to downtime but do nothing with it. I sit impotent, cycling through a list of possible activities and dismissing them all. It's all empty, accompanied by guilt. I should be doing more. I am not creating value, I am complaining but not generating, I am just like them. I am just like all of the ones I despise, I am becoming them, I will become them, I will die like them and with them. The bluster and anger are fruitless and only an echo of the human condition. We are not fundamentally good. We are fundamentally weak, stupid, and wretched. We are subject to cognitive distortions that we can't ever fully get a handle on, even when we're aware of them. We are subject to passions that drive us to poor decisions and hasty actions, many of them profoundly antisocial. We are angry. We are violent. We are incurably tribal. We are going to destroy ourselves, and possibly take the planet along with us.

There is no hope. There is no one coming to the rescue.

"azkg1g","conspiracy","unknown","The Truth About Climate Change","We’ve all come across the images of polar bears drifting on ice floes: emblematic victims of the global warming that’s melting the polar ice caps, symbols of the threat to the earth posed by our ceaseless energy production—above all, the carbon dioxide that factories and automobiles emit. We hear louder and louder demands to impose limits, to change our wasteful ways, so as to save not only the bears but also the planet and ourselves.

In political discourse and in the media, major storms and floods typically get presented as signs of impending doom, accompanied by invocations to the environment and calls to respect Mother Nature. Only catastrophes seem to grab our attention, though, and it’s rarely mentioned that warming would also bring some benefits, such as expanded production of grains in previously frozen regions of Canada and Russia. Nor do we hear that people die more often of cold weather than of hot weather. Isolated voices criticize the alarm over global warming, considering it a pseudoscientific thesis, the true aim of which is to thwart economic modernization and free-market growth and to extend the power of states over individual choices.

Not being a climatologist myself, I’ve always had trouble deciding between these arguments. And then I met Judith Curry at her home in Reno, Nevada. Curry is a true climatologist. She once headed the department of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, until she gave up on the academy so that she could express herself independently. “Independence of mind and climatology have become incompatible,” she says. Do you mean that global warming isn’t real? I ask. “There is warming, but we don’t really understand its causes,” she says. “The human factor and carbon dioxide, in particular, contribute to warming, but how much is the subject of intense scientific debate.”

Curry is a scholar, not a pundit. Unlike many political and journalistic oracles, she never opines without proof. And she has data at her command. She tells me, for example, that between 1910 and 1940, the planet warmed during a climatic episode that resembles our own, down to the degree. The warming can’t be blamed on industry, she argues, because back then, most of the carbon-dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels were small. In fact, Curry says, “almost half of the warming observed in the twentieth century came about in the first half of the century, before carbon-dioxide emissions became large.” Natural factors thus had to be the cause. 

None of the climate models used by scientists now working for the United Nations can explain this older trend. Nor can these models explain why the climate suddenly cooled between 1950 and 1970, giving rise to widespread warnings about the onset of a new ice age. I recall magazine covers of the late 1960s or early 1970s depicting the planet in the grip of an annihilating deep freeze. According to a group of scientists, we faced an apocalyptic environmental scenario—but the opposite of the current one.

But aren’t oceans rising today, I counter, eroding shorelines and threatening to flood lower-lying population centers and entire inhabited islands? “Yes,” Curry replies. “Sea level is rising, but this has been gradually happening since the 1860s; we don’t yet observe any significant acceleration of this process in our time.” Here again, one must consider the possibility that the causes for rising sea levels are partly or mostly natural, which isn’t surprising, says Curry, for “climate change is a complex and poorly understood phenomenon, with so many processes involved.” To blame human-emitted carbon dioxide entirely may not be scientific, she continues, but “some find it reassuring to believe that we have mastered the subject.” She says that “nothing upsets many scientists like uncertainty.”

This brings us to why Curry left the world of the academy and government-funded research. 

#“Climatology has become a political party with totalitarian tendencies,” she charges. “If you don’t support the UN consensus on human-caused global warming, if you express the slightest skepticism, you are a ‘climate-change denier,’ a stooge of Donald Trump, a quasi-fascist who must be banned from the scientific community.” 

These days, the climatology mainstream accepts only data that reinforce its hypothesis that humanity is behind global warming. Those daring to take an interest in possible natural causes of climactic variation—such as solar shifts or the earth’s oscillations—aren’t well regarded in the scientific community, to put it mildly. The rhetoric of the alarmists, it’s worth noting, has increasingly moved from “global warming” to “climate change,” which can mean anything. That shift got its start back in 1992, when the UN widened its range of environmental concern to include every change that human activities might be causing in nature, casting a net so wide that few human actions could escape it.

Scientific research should be based on skepticism, on the constant reconsideration of accepted ideas: at least, this is what I learned from my mentor, the ultimate scientific philosopher of our time, Karl Popper. 

#What could lead climate scientists to betray the very essence of their calling? The answer, Curry contends: “politics, money, and fame.” 

Scientists are human beings, with human motives; nowadays, public funding, scientific awards, and academic promotions go to the environmentally correct. 

**Among climatologists, Curry explains, “a person must not like capitalism or industrial development too much and should favor world government, rather than nations”; think differently, and you’ll find yourself ostracized. “Climatology is becoming an increasingly dubious science, serving a political project,” she complains. In other words, “the policy cart is leading the scientific horse.”**

#""Nowadays, public funding, scientific awards, and academic promotions go to the environmentally correct.”


This has long been true in environmental science, she points out. The global warming controversy began back in 1973, during the Gulf oil embargo, which unleashed fear, especially in the United States, that the supply of petroleum would run out. The nuclear industry, Curry says, took advantage of the situation to make its case for nuclear energy as the best alternative, and it began to subsidize ecological movements hostile to coal and oil, which it has been doing ever since. The warming narrative was born.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration played a role in the propagation of that narrative. Having ended its lunar expeditions, NASA was looking for a new mission, so it built some provisional climate models that focused primarily on carbon dioxide, because this is an easy factor to single out and “because it is subject to human control,” observes Curry. Even though it is just one among many factors that cause climate variations, carbon dioxide increasingly became the villain. Bureaucratic forces at the UN that promote global governance—by the UN, needless to say—got behind this line of research. 

Then the scientists were called upon and given incentives to prove that such a political project was scientifically necessary, recalls Curry. The UN founded the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 to push this agenda, and ever since, climatologists—an increasingly visible and thriving group—have embraced the faith.

In 2005, I had a conversation with Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian railway engineer, who remade himself into a climatologist and became director of the IPCC, which received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize under his tenure. Pachauri told me, without embarrassment, that, at the UN, he recruited only climatologists convinced of the carbon-dioxide warming explanation, excluding all others. This extraordinary collusion today allows politicians and commentators to declare that “science says that” carbon dioxide is to blame for global warming, or that a “scientific consensus” exists on warming, implying that no further study is needed—something that makes zero sense on its face, as scientific research is not based on consensus but on contradictory views.

Curry is skeptical about any positive results that might follow from environmental treaties—above all, the 2016 Paris Climate Accord. By the accord’s terms, the signatory nations—not including the United States, which has withdrawn from the pact—have committed themselves to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in order to stabilize the planet’s temperature at roughly its present level. Yet as Curry elaborates, **even if all the states respected this commitment—an unlikely prospect—the temperature reduction in 2100 would be an insignificant two-tenths of a degree. And this assumes that climate-model predictions are correct.** If there is less future warming than projected, the temperature reductions from limiting emissions would be even smaller.

Since the Paris Climate Accord was concluded, no government has followed through with any serious action. The U.S. pullout is hardly the only problem; India is effectively ignoring the agreement, and France “misses its goals of greenhouse-gas reduction every year,” admits Nicolas Hulot, the French environmental activist and former minister for President Emmanuel Macron. The accord is unenforceable and carries no sanctions—a condition insisted upon by many governments that wouldn’t have signed on otherwise. We continue to live in a contradictory reality: on the one hand, we hear that nothing threatens humanity as much as rising atmospheric carbon dioxide; on the other hand, nothing much happens practically to address this allegedly dire threat. Most economists suggest that the only effective incentive to reduce greenhouse-gas levels would be to impose a global carbon tax. No government seems willing to accept such a levy.

Is there an apocalyptic warming crisis, or not? “We’re always being told that we are reaching a point of no return—that, for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice pack is the beginning of the apocalypse,” Curry says. “But this melting, which started decades ago, is not leading to catastrophe.” Polar bears themselves adapt and move elsewhere and have never been more numerous; they’re less threatened by the melting, she says, than by urbanization and economic development in the polar region. Over the last year or so, moreover, the planet has started cooling, though “no one knows whether it will last or not, or whether it will put all the global-warming hypotheses in question.” 

According to Curry, the truly dramatic rupture of the ice pack would come not from global-warming-induced melting but from “volcanic eruptions in the Antarctic region that would break up the ice, and these cannot be predicted.” Climatologists don’t talk about such eruptions because their theoretical models can’t account for the unpredictable.

Does Curry recommend passivity, then? Not at all. In her view, research should be diversified to encompass study of the natural causes of climate change and not focus so obsessively on the human factor. She also believes that, instead of wasting time on futile treaties and in sterile quarrels, we would do better to prepare ourselves for the consequences of climate change, whether it’s warming or something else. 

Despite outcries about the proliferation of extreme weather incidents, she points out, hurricanes usually do less damage today than in the past because warning systems and evacuation planning have improved. That suggests the right approach.

Curry’s pragmatism may not win acclaim in environmentalist circles or among liberal pundits, though no one effectively contests the validity of her research or rebuts the data that she cites about an exceedingly complex reality. But then, neither reality nor complexity mobilizes passions as much as myths do, which is why Judith Curry’s work is so important today. She is a myth-buster.
