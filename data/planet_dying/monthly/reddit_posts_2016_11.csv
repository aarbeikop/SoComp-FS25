Please share and help make it more convincing!","A large percentage of Americans view their government as out of touch with its working class. There are current regulations in place that make it difficult for an economy to grow. The FDA makes producing and growing food and drugs a hassle, the EPA exponentially increases the costs of running a business. It’s easy to think that out of touch government regulations are ruining businesses, the #1 job creators in the country. However, these regulations are there for a purpose. They exist to ensure the safety of the food we eat, the products we consume, and the world that we live on, and will live on for countless generations. Business and regulation in the interest of the environment are seemingly at odds with each other. That does not have to be the case.
	 A very large portion of current rhetoric in support of de-regulation cite massive job loss in both the oil and the coal industries, which is entirely true. From 2008-2012 jobs in the coal industry fell by 50,000. The oil industry dwarfed this number with a job loss count of 350,000. That’s a huge number of people left without an income to support themselves and their families. One way to look at solving this problem is to backtrack on government regulations and start supporting manufacturing and businesses again. While this seems appealing to a lot of people it ignores the other side of the argument and doesn’t leave room to compromise.
      There are good reasons for the world to distance itself from fossil fuels. It negatively impacts the world around us both directly and indirectly. The most well known and controversial  indirect effect is climate change. Fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct which unnaturally stays in the atmosphere and traps in heat. According to NASA 2015 was the hottest year since record keeping began over 200 years ago. Climate change causes more than just a rise in temperature. There is a remarkably high amount of sea ice on Earth, so much that the planet's coastlines are in very serious danger of flooding if the ice is melted, displacing millions of people and making climate change a direct threat to humanity.
     The burning of fossil fuels also directly impacts us in the present. The burning of fossil fuels creates air pollution that we can see today. Smog has been reduced since it was at its highest point in the 20th century but remains a potential health threat to anyone living in a large city. It doesn’t take a lot of looking to find cities severely impacted by pollution even today. In 2008 Beijing, China was made famous to the western world when the olympics were set to be held there. There were protests and boycotts of the game due to human rights violations and the negative health effects air pollution would have on the athletes. Whom plenty of arrived to the games as late as possible to avoid the air, which is 6 times more polluted than the World Health Organization recommends.
     There are two clear sides to the issue. One cites the historic loss of American jobs and  the struggling middle class families who relied on them, and one cites the detrimental effects our current means of energy production cause. The compromise between these two sides is not to deregulate business or to ignore climate change. It is to invest and grow the economy in the clean energy sector instead of backtracking into dying businesses. Americans are already well aware of the job loss in the fossil fuel industry and maybe not so aware of the growth in the clean energy sector. 
	As stated previously, the coal industry lost 50,000 jobs from 2008-2012. In that same period solar and wind power added 80,000 jobs. Wind and solar power are also getting far cheaper and more commercially viable than they used be. In 1977 the cost of solar was $76.67 per watt. In 2014 it costs a mere $0.49 per watt. That's an insane price reduction that consistently decreases every year. Even if no government action is taken to run the United States on renewable energy it’s clear to see how solar and wind power may just outcompete fossil fuel regardless. In another amazing example the relatively newly formed electric car (and now solar panel) company “Tesla” generated more money last quarter than the entire oil industry in the United States, who lost 67 billion dollars that same year.
	Taxing renewable energy sources, investing in fossil fuels, and deregulating businesses is a step backwards for America. Fossil fuels are a limited resource that will run dry, it doesn’t make sense to try and revive these industries. Imagine if all the near deserted oil fields in Texas and North Dakota were made into solar or wind farms. Imagine if solar panels or solar tiles were installed in the majority of homes in the United States, currently less than 1% of homes utilize solar power. There’s hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created in the renewable energy sector and hundreds of thousands of Americans that could reinvigorate the economy. Protecting the environment does not have to equal a loss of jobs, in fact just the opposite. The economy and the environment are entirely capable of growing side by side. Investing in the future of America and its pristine wilderness is among the best ways to make America great again.

"5b4ih9","vegan","unknown","Eating Animals - My path","For more than 8 years I had enjoyed a vegetarian diet, which had left me feeling altogether better. Better energy, better sleep, better digestion, better physical fitness, better health and wellness.

I grow a good portion of what I eat. The correlation may be circumstantial or fanciful, but farming my food seems to have made me healthier, too.

I tilted toward going totally vegan in 2014. No animals. No eggs or dairy. Instead, mostly stuff that’s live or sprouted or green. I finally made the change in 2015 -  100% vegan. 

I’m certain that our society’s current model for producing and consuming meat is dangerous and unsustainable. There are several ways to measure how bad eating animals is for our health and for our planet. Cattle consume 80% of all farmland, pastures that could be used to grow food to feed billions. Cattle account for 70% of all antibiotics consumed in the United States. Cattle account for a greater percentage of humanity’s greenhouse-gas emissions than planes, trains, and automobiles combined.

And then there’s the part no one is really comfortable talking about. The animals we eat live only to die for our plate. They might as well be so many identical blades of grass — except they taste better to most folks than fibrous leaves. Billions of these pigs and chickens and cows are processed through factory farms that would likely disgust even dedicated flesh eaters. There is nothing noble in their “sacrifice” for us; they’re involuntary victims of our appetites, nothing more. Our appetites cause suffering.

I would like not to be the cause of suffering. In man or animal — which, at the end of the day, are the same thing.

"5cmm8x","futurology","unknown","I posted this as a comment regarding global warming/climate change, but thought this might be a good discussion as an actual post.","So too much CO2 is bad because it's warming up the environment? I think more specifically like a greenhouse effect yeah? Almost exactly like a greenhouse. An environment that is rich in CO2 levels and radiation from the sun. The overabundance of products that plants need to thrive on. And this is somehow bad because it's getting supposedly a little warmer? No, not desert warm, but greenhouse effect warm. I don't get it. I really don't get it. How is this bad? Yes maybe the polar ice caps are melting, maybe it's getting a little warmer (very little, check your facts), but all I see is the earth's atmosphere/environment/natural process has been partially sped up a miniscule bit to become this rich vegetacious (sp?) planet again. Remember we are still recovering from the ice age you know. And speaking of ages, when was the last time our earth was emitting an extreme overabundance of CO2 in the atmosphere? Let's see, it was a long time ago when the earth was young. The earth's crust was cooling off like crazy via certain ventilation pipes (volcanoes) and what was coming out of it? Oh yeah lots and lots of carbon into the atmosphere! What happened next? Oh just the periods of massive living things, including and especially plant life! Yes, the one great part of earth's history where giants roamed the earth (dinosaurs) and rainforests blanketed the entire globe.  That meant what then? Huh? What meant what? What do you mean? The products! The products of a huge amounts of CO2 greenhouse gases, sunlight, and eventually vast vegetation, what is the PRODUCT?!!  Oxygen for us and carbon utilization!

 But why is this bad? Because we are seeing change? We don't see progress right now, we see the ice caps melting, the environment changing, animal life dying, but we also see new species being discovered! Why is that? Well, long story short it's because of change! Hate to break it to you but earth has been constantly changing its environment long before we humans had arrived, changing the vegetation, changing its inhabitants, changing, yes, the global climate long before us. We've been here for a SPEC, a tiny little blot, on its overall time line and suddenly we have been here just long enough to see the changing clock's hands begin to move, begin to tick. And we are afraid. Afraid of what? That we broke the clock? That we might have sped it up? The former is impossible, the latter is probable but with little significance in the vast timeline. I think this all comes down to the fact that we are afraid of change. We need to look at the past (from the beginning) to see the BIG picture, the direction the earth is changing towards. It's not a desert of baron landscape we are headed towards if the atmosphere is changing into a greenhouse environment. A few fucking seeds in the ground of that type of environment will produce (overtime obviously) a luscious green one. Yes our marine algae is wasting away, the carbon is being released in the air /atmosphere BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT HALF THE FUCKING CIRCLE OF THE PROCESS!! we are not looking and learning from history! We are not taking into account that carbon goes in and out of the earth like the cycle of water, but slower and with greater change. My guess, the algae is dying because of change, but there will be more to come in the future, a different breed of algae that is more suited for the changing environment. We see change and we freak out and want to control it. Some people are capitalizing on our fear in hopes of trying to control the ticking of the global clock of change, but I'm afraid that fear is due to a misguided lack of knowledge of the big overall picture. Why do you think scientists are so divided on this issue (much more divided than the ""media"" says they are)? Let us not be afraid of change. Let us look and see the entire timeline.
