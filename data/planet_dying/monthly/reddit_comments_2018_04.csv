"dx7goq0","t3_8bji0e","8bji0e","green","lifestyle","Well, the missing part of his argument is the concentration of GHGs and their impact on the climate at those concentrations. So he is really arguing against a straw man. I had never seen any scientific argument against all GHGs, just the level of GHGs. 

Yes, his statement is true. Green House Gasses our an important part of our atmosphere and with out them the temperature would be colder and life would be very different. With out GHGs it is unlikely humans would have been able to evolve and definitely not invent agriculture in its current form.

That being said, just because something is good and even necessary doesn’t mean too much of it can’t also cause harm. And this is the argument behind anthropogenic climate change. As we increase the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere, the energy balance of our planet changes. This energy balance is based on the total amount of incoming radiation minus the amount of our going radiation. One driving force of this balance is GHGs.  If this balance is changed and the overall incoming energy doesn’t equal that out going energy, our global temperature will change. How this change affects our Climate is the concern we must address. 

Edit: in his argument he even said “natural balance”. Ask him what he means by “balance”. 

Something balancing usually means it can be thrown off balance. For example, a bicyclist is balancing on two wheels and his forward momentum keeps him balanced. But if he comes to a stop he will lose his balance and tip to one side or another.

Global climate is the same. Change the amount of GHGS in the atmosphere and you throw off the “natural balance”. This is why we strive to emit as little GHG as possible. ","2018-04-11 21:14:52","2","howardcord","1747906322.5490088","our planet is dying","manual"

"dy4saq2","t3_8fjiyj","8fjiyj","conspiracy","unknown","It is really hard for me to feel enthusiasm when I see people awake like this. I'm not going to be condescending about it because it is a good thing for them and ultimately humanity and I am grateful if not worried for you, OP.

It reminds me of my first ironically manic episodes of these types of discoveries and how the first thing I needed to do was share it with any person I could and I shared it in a very similar manner, chaotic that is.

It took me many years to realize that sharing this type of knowledge in such a chaotic and animated fashion actually pushes you away from your objective of enlightening others. People just simply don't converse in that manner regardless of how useful or true your information is. You'll eventually (hopefully after you get some sleep) be able to do that or you'll not see the results you are so passionate about.

Time and time again people that awaken have this untouchable confidence that is very susceptible to being crushed, especially when they have no source of income or way to persevere the war on our minds and bodies (do not underestimate the hardships that are coming for you). The discovery of this knowledge has been fashioned in such a way that the more enthusiastic you get about bracing it and sharing it, the more susceptible you are to the negative feelings that will come with the disappointment when you realize that things aren't getting fixed anytime soon, or that you will have to watch loved ones, friends, and family fall to the system, or struggle on every level to just survive outside of the system or to survive within in when every ounce of you is avidly at war with it.

They know this as much as I and others here do and they are waiting for you to buckle under the pressure and you feel untouchable right now but this is only the beginning for you. Buckle up because this ride is going to be the longest, hardest, roughest war you will ever fight and it doesn't end until they do and the stronger and more influential you become in shifting the tide, the more you are noticed and the quicker you will be targeted and news flash, you do not want to be targeted. Chances are you and I and many of us will die before any significant victory is acheived against their regime, so get your long-term strategies in order.

Moving on to what it is to be awakened and in the war, if you will.

Think of it like a game of Mafia in which you are amidst a group of people consisting of two different factions: the innocent and the guilty. I'm going to explain much of the game because how relevant it is and important to your survival should you continue to preach as you are. The game is played in two repeating cycles, day and night. During the day every person from both factions are brought together and none of the innocents are aware of who the other innocents are nor are they aware of who the guilty are whereas the guilty know exactly who the other guilty are and therefore who all of the innocents are. Each day the group of people consisting of both factions try to determine the alignment of each other to find the guilty. At the end of the day, they can vote to hang someone. Sometimes they accidentally hang innocent and sometimes they hang guilty. During the night cycle, the guilty get together to discuss who they want to kill. They get a certain amounts of kills per night based on the amount of guilty alive at that time. When the day cycle begins, if the guilty choose to kill someone, then the town consisting of everyone sees that the mafia chose to kill someone and have to try and determine who had motive for killing that person and why. Now the innocents aren't all weak and powerless, they have what are called power roles among them. Sticking with one version of the game that works for my purpose, there is a cop that on each night can select an individual. After the 2nd night, if this cop is still alive, he will be told if there is a different or same alignment between the first person he selected on night 1 and the second person he selected on night 2. This is obviously very useful information for town so you can imagine that mafia would want to know who the cop is so they can kill them and keep themselves safer. The cop can choose to hold this information until a crucial point of the game when town is  either the most united or most split or come out early to try and get early  hangs on mafia. What is important to understand is that none of the other innocents know if the cop is indeed the cop. He could be mafia and be trying to falsely persuade the innocents into a direction that is actually beneficial to the guilty. You can see how overwhelming this problem has become in our current society, especially when technology now exists that can fake so much. And that is I believe all I need to explain about the game of Mafia to continue my point.

From here on out since you are informed, you are a power role amongst the innocent. You have knowledge that is very helpful in defeating the guilty and saving the innocent and the more time that passes, the more knowledge you will acquire and the heavier the burden will become.

Now the guilty will not kill you for just sharing the information you or I have here because it is not the information itself that is the threat, it is the reach of influence in swaying the masses to our cause. You and I have very little influence right now, most people do and honestly, that isn't a bad thing. Low influence keeps people alive. The ones with great influence against their agenda never live for long, just look at the history of our species and the great minds which you know to have been on our side. While one person with exceptional influence to the masses is capable of shifting the tides of the war, they are essentially outting to the guilty that they are a power role and will be targeted swiftly and discretely (in most cases). It is far more advantageous for the living power roles of our side to keep their influence at levels that keep them alive and yet push progress forward. In the game of mafia this is done by the power roles trying to pass cues to the other towns that they are a power role whilst appearing weak and powerless to the mafia so they are not killed off, this is impossibly difficult in the game since everything is seen by everyone during the day but much easier in our time if you know how they surveil you and it is quite grand for them right now and we do not have precise knowledge of all their means, some of them we can't even dream to understand I imagine.

It is ironic that subterfuge could be the potential strategy that shifts the tides but it makes complete sense when you consider the concepts of warfare. When an enemy is far stronger and resourceful than you, you generally cannot win in a direct conflict. It shouldn't surprise anybody to hear that we can't win in a direct conflict with our current numbers though I am not suggesting death upon my enemies, that can lead to becoming guilty yourself but I don't want to delve into that philosophy right now. The point is that you are far more likely to survive and make an impact in this very long war if you retain and improve your power for the cause of the innocents whilst keeping yourself at a level of influence that keeps you from being targeted by them (that impossible task I mentioned in Mafia). Posting as you or I have here is very unlikely to put your life in any kind of danger, we are like ants to their current power and influence on the masses. Alone with high targetable influence we may be prevented from making progress by being silenced, united with low untargetable influence eventually makes an impact when the number of ants increases to a level that can't be stopped without mass destruction, and believe me they have those counter-measures in place if their regime is coming to and end and they are very spiteful so try not to be overly too hopeful in success, it is very unlikely but don't give up just because hope can seem lost, I haven't and I have zero faith in humanity. It has taken over ten years for me to see true progress in the fight and sadly I'm numb to the enthusiasm of your likes and others and most of you won't last the hardships that you will have to endure, I barely do myself and I might not be long on this Earth because of it, but I have hopes that things will continue to make progress as you and other people continue to awaken and continue the fight for what humanity should be should I or other experienced people lose our means to fight or have it taken away. Wish you the best of luck, don't get yourself killed and get educated on educating or none of us or our children or their children will see the end of this horrific regime.

Since you are in the mind of loving people, I'll have you know I love you too so take care of your body before we lose you. Manic will kill you if you are not careful, especially with additives.

There is a very significant shift in the content and frequency of the comments you have been posting the past two days. You are very clearly having a manic episode of some sort. I'm not sure if you have any pre-existing mental conditions or not or if you are on medication.

I also don't know your situation, but if you have friends, family, a therapist, or someone you can talk to, I would recommend doing so. Especially if you feel like you might harm yourself or others.

I am not saying this to be mean. I am saying it out of general concern. It is not just the content or frequency of your posts (though both are troubling), but it is that this is a *marked* shift from your posting habits up until now.

I'd also compared this existence to ""Flowers in the Attic"". Minus the incest parts. Those kids were swayed into thinking mommy's gonna get close to her daddy again so she can get her inheritance. Hide the kids away. The kids bought into the lie. Those kids were never gonna make it out of the attic. The mother was poisoning them by putting arsenic on the cookies/doughnuts. Cory died. The other three managed to escape. We are those flowers in the attic. We just keep getting conned into believing a bunch of bullshit that makes this existence worth coming to. And we only get poisoned right from the start. It's long gotten to the point where I hate to eat anything these days because everything tastes fake. I had a VERY bad experience with artificial sweetener and have to be on the look out for that. So many poisoned things. And our minds are just as poisoned. Look at the way a lot of people act. So many people LOVE to do cruel things to others. We all hurt when we have to depend on a toxic system to live in and depend on people to do the right and honorable thing and they don't. You always have to look to see if some asshole's gonna stab you in the back.

----
I admit I'm not into new age woo-woo. I'm not gonna love hateful people or people that have hurt me or try to hurt me. I'm a misanthrope today because of the past. I'm somebody that'd be happy living as a hermit tbh. I'm that sick of people. I want out of this existence because I realize there's just nothing here in ""the attic"" outside of pain, suffering and poison. I want to be able to leave this place just like the ending to the original ""Flowers in the Attic"" movie. Cathy, Chris and Carrie joined hands and left Foxworth Hall.

Yes, I know ""Flowers in the Attic"" is a work of fiction. But I just can't help picturing the parallels between that story and this existence.
