Alas, I don't have much time to reply, so I'll just bring forward what I see as The Main Thing.  What follows is brief, incomplete and contains some unstated simplifications.

The ideas behind the text you wrote largely came from your neocortex, the 'thinking' or 'enlightened' brain.  That's good, and all humans need to spend as much time there as possible.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of our thinking is still firmly rooted in the more primitive limbic system.  Fear, love, anger, disgust: most of our basic emotions live there.

Some have argued, and I intuitively agree, that even the most enlightened humans are only barely sentient.  We experience an internally created illusion of self control, careful thought, etc.  But, at best, our behaviour is only rarely driven by the neocortex.

Yes, the neocortex is busy and has allowed us to win the great game of evolution here on our planet.  But our thoughts are always pushed and driven by basic emotions.

This makes most of us very short sighted, no matter how much proof or information wr have before us.

Of course, all characteristics, across a population, fall on some kind of bell curve.  A small fraction of the total happen to be wired in a way that allows us to be moved to potential action by our thoughts and concerns about the future.

It is good that only a small fraction of the total have this trait, because otherwise there would be chaos, and civilization would be impossible.

In short, our collective technology has evolved far, far more quickly than our collective neurobiology.  We are where we are because we won, and we won because of many of the same neurosocial traits that are now getting us in trouble.

We need to evolve, quickly.  Likely far more quickly than is possible.

So, we do what we have always done, but on the grandest scale yet: we ride out the storm and discover what's on the other side ","2018-12-04 19:39:23","2","diederich","1747919428.013521","our planet is dying","manual"
"ecj4k9v","t3_a9e1kp","a9e1kp","collapse","skeptical","I’ve recently gone through the same mental journey myself. Slow realization, followed by an increasing sense of dread and panic. Late 2016 kicked off a rough patch for me, between Trump and a college course which revealed the severity of climate change to me. I became a miserable alcoholic. Drinking was the only thing that could take me away from the knowledge I was walking around with, the impending doom of it all.

I fell down a really dark hole. I dropped out of school and broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. Rehab and AA did nothing to curb my drinking. Even when I was sober, I was horribly suicidal and depressed. I found solace in video games (“Celeste” being especially helpful) and music (endless thanks to Kevin Parker), and regressed into a private world of reinvention.

Then it hit me. I’m gonna die anyway. Today, tomorrow, in a year, in ten or twenty; completely alone in a freak accident, or alongside billions of others in a collapse event, I WILL DIE NO MATTER WHAT.

In the meantime, I get to enjoy the internet, the pinnacle of human achievement. Anything I want to know, I can know. Anything I want to listen to, any game I want to play, any movie I want to watch. I carry the wealth of human information around in my pocket. How DARE I be depressed?

Recently, I’ve started working with my local homeless population. I don’t deserve the luxuries I enjoy, so the very least I can do is dedicate some time to spreading the wealth. I feel fulfilled, with brand new eyes. Life is a trip. Everything is worth paying attention to, and we can derive meaning from every experience we encounter. I’m reminded of this quote from Hayao Miyazaki:

“There cannot be a happy ending to the fight between the raging gods and humans. However, even in the middle of hatred and killings, there are things worth living for. A wonderful meeting, or a beautiful thing can exist. We depict hatred, but it is to depict that there are more important things. We depict a curse, to reveal the joy of liberation.”

In May 2006, *exactly 40 years later*, **Chairman Gore** alleged that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society at large, aiming to turn the Earth into a flaming cinder, and launched a 'Green Revolution' and 'Great Leap Backward' which, over the next 20 years *we can only hope*, won't genocide 20,000,000 more people.

At the ""$2,700 per CO2-ton"" ransom that IPCC is demanding nations impose as a 'Carbon Tax', which is $56 a gallon (€14 a liter) at the pump in layman's terms, if the Gore Gang of Four succeeds with their pogrom, it will probably genocide 200,000,000.

It is unfortunate that we create industrial waste but two things. Looking at our species history this is not normal and we do have some regulations against this.

>Humans create stupid divisive ideals like capitalism and socialism (both are stupid in the end). And the worst thing is that humans have reduced themselves to breeders overpopulating our planet and they keep doing it.

Humans are the only species capable of thinking ideas about how to run a society at least in their view, better. I think that's remarkable. And all species reproduce if they have the resources to do so, even if it is unsustainable, that is why hunter and prey cycles are a thing in nature for an example.

>Quite frankly, collapse is the best thing that could happen. Humans need to disappear forever. What humans have done to nature is shameful. Humans are selfish and because of this humans need to disappear. 

I agree it is shameful but at the same time no species deserves to die. If they do then they do and if they don't,  they don't. All species would do exact he same thing if it was in our position.","2018-12-05 04:46:06","1","Farade","1747919930.9203389","our planet is dying","manual"

Everyone expects you to carve out time for them even though it may not be so easy because of work, kids, etc. My husband has a difficult family dynamic: a real mom, a step mom (not married to his dad anymore), a dad, and an Aunt & Uncle that are like parents. We’re celebrating Christmas with his real mom next weekend, because it doesn’t matter that it’s not on Christmas Day. It matters that we’re spending that time together. We will have Christmas with his step mom the weekend after. Maybe you and your boyfriend can spend time with his family a weekend before or after Christmas? I am sorry it seems like they are just leaving him out. They could be dealing with grief differently and not realizing they are hurting his feelings. I think he should sit them down and tell them how they have hurt him and how he feels distant from them. Communication is so important, people really don’t realize how their actions affect others sometimes even though it should be obvious.

Your misfortune is not having to live a mediocre life. It's believing you could live one that is not.

>What's the point in doing ANYTHING (college, relationships, etc.) if we're all going to be thrusted into a world that actively seeks to destroy good people?

If the world was't actively trying to fuck you over, would we even need to do things? Freedom is a means to an end. Those who mistake it for an end do not know what to do with it once they have it.

>We can't control our urges

Speak for yourself. All the kewl kids give no fucks about what society thinks. Edgelords are unironically wholesome.

> I want to die because I don't want to die later at the hands of something I know I could've prevented if given the platform and power.

>the only reasons people tell me not to are because they want me to suffer for the sake of me being in their lives as a background character

Now that's just arrogant. Get a hold of yourself.

...

Tl;dr: Why do you even? Everything is about you. Ppl not listening to you. Your work being meaningless beacause of reasons. The judgement people impose upon you.

My advice?

Take that pride. Set it on fire, and go live for someone else's sake.

If you are truly worth something, there is someone who needs what you have to offer. Let the rest of the world prove you wrong, it will be a nice surprise.

Wholesomeness has always been the cure for the Nero Claudius syndrome.

"eb7g2iv","t3_a3jvjz","a3jvjz","vegan","unknown","Currently a lot of meat eaters try to absolve themselves from responsibility by saying ""I care, but it's too hard to be vegan, so I'll wait for lab-grown meat"".  

Maybe a major part of the population switches over but I'm not too optimistic for a few reasons:  

- the meat industry will do everything in their power to sabotage lab grown meat if it is actually any good. And they have the power to do so by lobbying lawmakers to make certification a very costly and lengthy process. All the expenses for certification have to be recouped over the price, while ""normal"" meat is heavily subsidized. Expect lab grown meat to be much more expensive and not any better than ""normal"" meat, which means omnis won't have any reason to switch and lower the price through higher production numbers.  
- There are already vegan meat alternatives out that taste so close to meat that many vegans find them disgusting and don't trust them. So far, I haven't heard of too many omnis replacing all real meat in their diet with those.  
- When lab grown meat eventually does become widely available and cheap, expect real meat to become a status symbol. People won't want lab grown meat when eating out or inviting guests, cause they expect the ""real"" thing. Lab grown meat (if it ever becomes cheaper than real meat) will replace meat in processed food though, which would be awesome already.","2018-12-06 11:17:43","7","[deleted]","1747920582.9643981","our planet is dying","manual"

"eb7g95m","t3_a3jvjz","a3jvjz","vegan","unknown","YES! I have many omnis in my circle who are very interested in it. There will be an initial hump trying to get over people's distrust of it (which is why I prefer to refer to it as ""clean"" or ""craft""-- like beer, which the process would kind of resemble in a production setting) but that's when it's our job to tout the benefits. We could save SO many animal's lives with this-- I firmly feel we have the moral duty to promote it. If the topic interests you and you're looking to make your activism as effective as it can be, I highly recommend you check out the book The End of Animal Farming: How Scientists, Entrepreneurs, and Activists Are Building an Animal-Free Food System by Jacy Reese. It's a fantastic read!

EDIT: to those saying the meat industry will sabotage it-- the meat industry is integral in getting it up and running and will be a huge gateway into the current market. The meat industry is already pouring money into this. Tyson's own CEO even came out and said ""If we can grow meat without an animal, why wouldn't we?""","2018-12-06 11:21:33","1","Passion4Justice","1747920582.967319","our planet is dying","manual"
