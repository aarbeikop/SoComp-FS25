"4i5mi1","collapse","skeptical","It's time to build lifeboats","It's become obvious that the planet will soon be uninhabitable for the most part. When the oceans [start producing CO2 and hydrogen sulfide](https://robertscribbler.com/2016/04/28/ncar-global-temperature-increase-depletes-oxygen-in-most-ocean-zones-by-the-2030s/), it won't be a question of migration, it'll be extinction for large mammals. We'll be [unable to live in the heat](http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2016/05/05/New-research-links-climate-change-to-kidney-disease/5301462494809/), and unable to breathe the air.

It's going to get harder and harder to live, until it becomes impossible.

That doesn't mean everyone has to die.

The ship is sinking, and we're all either freaking out or downing drinks at the cash bar. What we need are lifeboats.

The question needs to shift from 'how do we fix everything we've fucked up in 200 years of burning fossil fuels in time to keep the environment from destabilizing' to 'how many people can reasonably survive now that the environment has destabilized?'

It's easy to think that our choices lie between a Disney happy-ever-after ending for everybody and total extinction, but I believe that, with our current technology, enough people can survive to continue the species.

We've been through [bottlenecks like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck) before. We were down to under [10,000 individuals](http://phys.org/news/2010-01-humans-endangered-species.html) at one point. We know that it's possible for the human race to survive environmental catastrophes, and go on to thrive again. 

I believe we're capable of building contained habitats that will allow tens or hundreds of thousands of people to survive, despite the scope of the damage we've done to the planet.

These won't be temporary shelters designed to ride out the weather while things get back to normal; things will never get back to normal. These will be our homes from now on. Once we learn to build habitats that allow us to survive on a planet turned hostile, we'll be able to survive anywhere. When we understand the interactions between human biology and environment, and have learned to create sustaining and sustainable environments, we can live on any planet we like. Or none.

Yes, it would be a huge project; learning how to design an environment in which human beings can thrive on an inhospitable planet. It will take everything we've learned about living in space and underwater, it will leverage every technology from solar energy to 3D printing, and it will be risky. 

But compared to the scope of the projects and the research that would be necessary to reverse the damage we've done the the planet, it's cake.

So the ship is sinking. The captain is telling everyone that things are fine, and the passengers are either oblivious or panicking. But there's plenty of stuff around that could be used to build lifeboats.
