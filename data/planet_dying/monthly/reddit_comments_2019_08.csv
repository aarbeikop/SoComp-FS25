The thing that money does well in comparison to socialism is that it gives intensive to do the „dirty“ jobs, aka the necessary ones no one wants to do by forcing people into it.( this is still a problem, but one that’s hard to overcome as long as we can’t automate everything) The other thing is a automated guide for needs of people. Higher demand leads to higher wages in the desired workforce und finally to more people going into the field. The question would be wether a administration could even decide which jobs are needed or not. A side effect is that capitalism drives innovation by exactly this idea.  

I think a big problem is that many people don’t clearly understand how the system works, which I can only explain by some people’s disinterest to learn anything. And i say this while having a relative socialist political view. I’m all for taxing the rich more, giving unconditional income and stuff, but it needs to work and there still needs to be some incentive for being left off „better“ to drive innovation and progress and to insure stability. And i will probability belong to those being relatively well off (mathematician going into finance). 

The main obstacle will probably be how we get there. For example if one country decided to tax the rich people, what stops those people from leaving the country, so that the country basically just looses a lot of money. you have to do this incrementally.

"eweowhg","t3_cnwzlz","cnwzlz","futurology","unknown","So I started off with a passion in science, ended up getting a BSc which I regret (wish I did engineering or math) BUT I did take economics later in university and it changed my world view.

You have to remember that people have unlimited desires, the constraint is on supply of scarce resources people want. Money is a way to lubricate an entire trade system by apportioning resources to that which is most highly valued. If people really want food, then the price of food goes up especially if it's scarce. Because of the high prices, people will move into agriculture and start producing food (chasing profits) until supply meets demand. Technology will be found as someone is going to sit there thinking how they can make more money, so they invent tech like a tractor/fertilizer etc...But this causes food prices to plummet which is good for the buyers but bad for the other suppliers (who don't have that tech) who will leave to do something else. This is why agriculture shrank and made way for manufacturing, which is dying now due to outsourcing and robotics (more efficient production from some greedy capitalist figuring out better processes or implementing tech).

&#x200B;

Money just directs human activities and priorities. It's called a price rationing mechanism, everything you need to know about supply/demand is contained into the single informational value of the price. They are votes on what society should be doing. ...This is probably where your argument comes in. Yes, we have a society full of ignorant dumbasses and value sports stars and celebs more than scientists. And I agree that is totally wrong. BUT it is their freedom and choice to decide, and all we can do is posit our ideas. It'll unlikely go anywhere though. The economy will hum along status quo. 

The socialists and communists tried centrally planned economies where a group that thought they knew better should manage an economy. It just ended up in bankruptcy, starvation, murder, gulags, and torture. Mao killed 30-50M people, Stalin 10M at least, and Pol Pot 3 million of his 8 million population. It's a failed system. And it's pretty damn consistent (look at Venezuela right now). So capitalism is far from a perfect system but it's the best we have. It uses greed to direct economic activity and does so well. Capitalism has lifted the most people out of poverty than any system. Back to food, I can get 1500 calories of energy to survive an entire day for less than 5 bucks at McDonald's, how is that for success? That's a few minutes of work at an office job.

By giving workers a personal stake in their company (and limiting the amount of wealth the elected 'boss' can take in, compared to the lowest-paid individual in said company), the idea is that we could tackle wealth inequality whilst maintaining the competitive structure that encourages growth.

This isn't even getting into generalised AI and automation, which - if genuinely achievable and utilised for the betterment of society - could render much of the values associated with the concepts of 'work' and 'wealth' obsolete.

Myself - I spent a significant portion of my life volunteering full-time, taking in unemployment benefits whilst studying, part-time. But because the work was non-profit and the study was for fun, people do try to shame you for it.

This, I feel, is a flaw in the current system. For all the talk about 'charity' and building up your nation, it always comes down to $ > Community. And it's **this** kind of attitude that betrays the true nature of Western, economic, structure.

Even in Star Trek, where they have replicators that make all their wants and have no more need to compete for resources... there are a handful of resources that can't be replicated. Currency is established for these resources, whether it be in goods, services, or ration chits.

"ewep7u5","t3_cnwzlz","cnwzlz","futurology","unknown","This wired magazine special from 2016 talks about Shenzhen. They started as a fishing village 30years ago and now they are an unrecognizable, constantly changing and growing city. The true realization of opensource and collective culture. Im definitely going to watch this again. Alot of feelings. 
First off, theres this concept of shenzhai which is basically robin hood style reverse engineering and opensource improvement of factory floor products. People would decide they can improve a product and they hate their worling conditions. They quit their job, improve the product and introduce it to compete in the marketplace. Rapid innovation low stability. 

The power of think tanks is that they are working towards a common cause. Contradictions are hashed out and the dialectic takes evolving thoughts to new heights collectively. In a sense the same principle is behind the hardware design process here in the principles of shenzhai. Products are just constantly improved on and it causes run away innovation because there is no proprietary information and patent enforcement controlling improvememt and slowing growth. Everything is open and approved upon as fast as people can add parts to it. Wikipedia, Amazon, Linux, Microsoft, FB and Apple AI... All open source projects that have improved our reality dramatically. So what better to apply the principle to than hardware? 
Silicon Valley overseas opperates under a  capitalist system obviously. Its proprietary patents, NDA, and monopolies stiffle innovation by snuffing out little guys who might have solutions that fit society's needs better. Anti trust is dead. This system does have its strengths however. It organizes the buying power to keep the whole system turning as corporate giants get people to buy into the VC projects making all of this possible. 

The two systems are independent yet interdependent. Who would organize the capital, to fund the ventures, that grew the cities, that taught the citizens, that lead to endless innovation?
Apparently silicon valleys VC firms send head hunters deep into these opensource hardware commie lands to find the next projects that restart the cycle. 

Brand new iphones with expandable and interchangable batteries, sd card slots and Android os for 1/7 the cost. Hoverboards. Gps smartwatches for children. Recycled tech to reduce waste. Maker faire festivals. A percentage of what comes out of silicon valley had its start in these underground open-source hardware societies.
 
We need both systems simultaneously. I think opensource itself is a constant thesis antithesis synthesis evolutionary process that reflects the way economic systems themselves arise, adapt, diversify and specialize into different functional systems. Does capitalism or communism stifle innovation? Yea they both can. A mixture of the two would be appropriate in deciding our future policies in the coming 4th industrial revolution. 

If we enter an age of AI under a capitalist paradigm it could quickly turn into oppression and a controlled economy. If we enter it with a shanzhai mentality of selfless collectivized interest, we could steer the purpose of AI towards the betterment of humanity and away from a small elite's personal interest. One way to do that would be using open source planning, what could be a better example of democracy than that? Direct democracy as a way to create the most optimal representitive democracy in open sourced AI programs. 

The economic theory optimal for providing human happiness changes relative to the paradigms that drive industry. As AI creates a new paradigm over the next few years, i think its important we maintain a balance of the two general philosophies when appropriate. (communism and capitalism). 
Its important that we maintain a controlled economy, with the structural framework and stability that capitalism provides. But what labor value will we have anymore? What bargaining power will be left? In what way at all will we remain a capitalist society? Will there really still be a free market? The two forces will need to check each other.","2019-08-09 06:25:13","10","king_nietzsche","1747934265.833487","our planet is dying","manual"
"ewetxut","t3_cnwzlz","cnwzlz","futurology","unknown","""Cant we, instead of *fighting* and hoarding for a better future, work towards sincerely creating as close to a utopia as possible without individual wealth and power being a concern?"" If this is supposed to be voluntary, you run into the problem of commons. If this is supposed to be enforced, well, historically, the state stopping anyone from having power is the state having all the power, and that's never gone well. 

And just generally economically, while its clear that certain areas of research that have little immediate profit potential are underfunded, and I'm in favor of expanding that funding(Look at all the great work ARPA-E does). But there's already a huge market for cancer drugs, and basically everyone who could make cancer drugs is doing so(drug researchers can make 6 digits easily). So to my mind just having a ridiculous amount of money that we're willing to spend on pet projects isn't the best way to stimulate scientific research of the profitable variety(see what I said about ARPA-E for when I think government-funded research is appropriate). To my mind, the best way to do this is to make sure that as much of the human population as possible is able to contribute to academic fields. Consider the following: 6.7% of the world population has a college degree. In the US, its 33%. Trying to raise countries(including our own) out of poverty and support their education(the mechanics of foreign aid are a whole are a huge can of worms), along with government sponsorship in the cases I described above, are the best government policies to increase worldwide scientific output.","2019-08-09 08:00:25","10","Barna13","1747934265.835746","our planet is dying","manual"

"eweps8d","t3_cnwzlz","cnwzlz","futurology","unknown","I agree! This is something I’ve been thinking about for a long time and you’ve put it into some nice words. It’s just the fact to me that we are running politics, governments, the world, the same way we have been since basically the beginning of civilized humans (although a few tweaks) is ridiculous! Yes the Romans created a cool democratic governmental system that was groundbreaking at the time, but we have no need to still use something like this! It was many thousands of years ago when we didn’t have any technology.... We need to radically change how society works. We have so many advances in technology now if we had focused on creating a utopian “government” focused on pure science, health, efficiency and happiness, then we could all be happier.

I mean think about it, 90% of the world population never get big mansions or live the big lavish rich life. So why are we so focused on this idea that we can all become rich, wealthy, and successful, if we focus on earning money and stepping on each other toes. The numbers say almost all of us can’t! So let’s focus on making living just better for all of us! So the base happiness and living quality of the 90% goes up as a whole. We have the means to do it!

"ewevhcp","t3_cnwzlz","cnwzlz","futurology","unknown","This really hit home so I had to comment. You've touched on my current everyday existential crisis, because I slave away for ""the man,"" breaking my soul and self into pieces to do a million pointless, mediocre tasks. It's endlessly frustrating because I signed up for the job to help people. I could be improving task efficiency, worker satisfaction and sense of community. I could be incorporating the local community in decisions my company makes that affect them. I could be re-shaping the direction of our work so that we aren't getting bogged down in short-sighted, profit-driven directions. 

But I can't actually do any of those things. I am the underling, and each time I make a suggestion to improve things or stand up and contest an immoral decision that leadership makes, I just get screwed over at work. The people who have the power to make a difference are not interested in doing so, and they don't even believe that there is a problem present.

In my last performance review, my supervisor noted that my desire to improve the workplace around me was a detriment to my career and I needed to change that or I would have trouble. It all boils down to power and power dynamics. When you are the small fish with big dreams, the world doesn't listen because it can't hear you; its ears are muffled by the hypnotic metronome pulsing out of the latest Apple headphones. They just care about their own asses once they reach a position of power, and all they want is to move up the established hierarchy and get more money. I don't understand why. 

I do think power is a self-selection process where those who would do the best job leading others are almost never the ones who seek out positions of power. This is a huge problem because we can't make any of these changes to humanity and the world unless we either form a world dictatorship with a benevolent and wise world leader (unlikely), or many like-minded individuals each seek their own seat of power, then come together for change. I'm assuming right now that existing leaders would object to your pacifist utopia, but I think that's a safe assumption.

What irks me the most in thinking about all of this beauty, equality, self- and world improvement and togetherness that we could be striving for, is that one of THE BIGGEST counterarguments to a million different components of your proposal is something like: ""oh but this structure is already in place"" or ""it's this way now and that works, so don't change it"" or ""I had to go through this shit, so it means nothing to me that you are going through it, in fact, I don't want to make things better for the people that come after me, they should suffer like I did to earn their place."" Those are just the concepts, probably not the actual phrases someone would use out loud. But that argument is the most retarded thing I have ever heard. I use retarded intentionally here and I do not mean to offend anyone, I just mean that it literally represents a slowing of humanity's advancement (logarithmic function) through clinging desperately to whatever already exists, instead of asymptotically approaching the ideal human utopia. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" is an extreme affront to the core drives of humanity.

"ewg7zci","t3_cnwzlz","cnwzlz","futurology","unknown","I have been researching various solutions here and there for our current broken systems. I recently read a book called, ""The Third Pillar."" I pile this book's recommendations on top of others I found. Since the 60s or so, governments lost legitimacy since the stagflation after the 1970s. It is easy to copy an old technology to experience growth, but once you are at the forefront of technology, pushing the production barrier out takes a lot of investment into technology for low gains.

Since the 1970s or so, most of the energy revolutions have been founded, and we have only been making marginal improvements since then. We used to experience high growth rates of 6+%. However, once we actually had to start inventing new technologies, our growth fell to around 2%. Apparently despite the amazing advances in computers, they have not contributed much to our GDP = Bottom\_line. Sure, we have self-check outs. However, those checkouts don't cause people to buy more stuff at stores. They don't push people faster through the checkout line. They just take less workers. Most of the robots in amazon haven't increased the speed of a warehouse (much). They just take less workers.

Well, you know what happens when growth is slow, and the people on top want to push ahead of reality? They find creative ways to extracting wealth from the poor. Hence, our middle class is disappearing. No, it didn't go to China, although some did. Most of it was lost to automation, who gets the value from automation? Workers? No, Investors get it. You know, the rich.

&#x200B;

It is not bad in a high growth period when market shares are effectively non-zero-sum. However, during slow growth, it looks like total market shares don't move much. So, instead of developing more market, it is more strategic to take market share from another business. This is the effect of the zero-sum or positive-sum game. Suddenly, the wealthiest businessmen are not moderate; they are cut-throat.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I don't feel like an overhaul is needed for capitalism. We just need to restructure the game so the incentives are different. It is good to incentivize people for contributing real value for $. However, we are presently incentivizing the rich for taking value from the poor. Instead we should incentivize the rich for making more value. We need to get back to a non-zero-sum game. However, if there is no more real value to be had, other than the low 2%, how do we have a non-zero-sum game? I haven't seen a solution like that yet. However, we can at least dis-incentivize the extractors.

&#x200B;

So, highly progressive income taxes to dis-incentivize people from making money and incentivizing people for doing what they love (like Finland). Retraining programs to get workers new jobs in a turbulent economy (Like Finland). Social democracy = leave businessman alone, but have a safety net (Like Western Europe). If the real wealth comes from stocks instead of jobs, then buy stocks (Like the Rich). Perhaps we can give each 18 year old a stock portfolio they can live off of as a safety net. Retrain with cheap MOOC education. Cap businesses to a 10% market share to eliminate monopsony, not monopoly, power against workers (a part of the problem of lower wages and less middle class). Since data companies have a monopoly on massive datasets, allow the data providers control over their data (a.k.a. ""I don't like Google's recent demonstration of ethics. So, I am porting my search history to Bing) (Like India). We can fund Hollywood to make science adventure stories, to change our culture's demands on the market. Finally, allowing local cities and communities greater political power to regulate production would empower the individual and disperse populism. However, state and federal courts would have to step in when one community harms another through tariffs or whatnot.

&#x200B;

Yes, in general more investment into science is a warm-hearted idea. However, most science doesn't create any real value. Most modern science is not used to produce a service or good that people want. Even science has limits, because there are so many microscopes, and we can only produce a limited amount each year. We cannot just give free science equipment to everyone. We could use game theory to structure markets to value spending time with their family or community over money or things. There are nations that try it. You are free to move there. These nations may ask you to be valuable to them before entry. However, if you have no value to give, then go get it. Germany has a social democracy, and they are big on industrial sciences. All you need is an IT or Programming degree and they will welcome you with open arms.

But above all, stop talking and do something. Be the change you want to see. Go do something in-demand and use your value to change the world. If we give free science equipment or \[blank\] and no one is motivated to earn value and make science or \[blank\] in the first place, then no one will make science or \[blank\]. Then no one can consume science or \[blank\]. Then we can all starve together. Sure, you want to change people's opinion here. However, just telling people your hopes is less persuasive than telling people about your successful business that promotes science.","2019-08-09 18:38:35","5","JJEng1989","1747934265.857088","our planet is dying","manual"

Along the way they encounter Ra and his fellow space eqyptian bad guys and it turns out they are human bodies taken over by a Goa'uld which is a big snake that hops into a human's mouth and takes over their brain and body with a completely separate consciousness and personality. The Goa'uld can chose different hosts, live forever, and travel through space reaping havoc.

This series on the surface is light hearted sci-fi but upon close inspection seems to present a fully formed hypothesis from an ancient building race that set up the Stargate system to a present day secret space program. Stargate SG-1 had evil reptilians before reptilians were even cool.

Here's the thing; driving down the highway through Colorado Springs, Cheyenne Mountain is towering above the town on the west side of the road. This is also the home of the Airforce Academy and the norad installation in Cheyenne Mountain as shown in SG-1. But, on the east side of the highway you'll pass a park with a giant ring scupltute with water cascading through the center that is nearly identical to the Stargate in the show when the portal is activated.

If all these other 'moons' are made up of the same material and light the night sky then it's a moon for all intents and purposes imo.

&#x200B;

As for the coincidence and mathematical impossibility of an eclipse, what's impossible about it? They happen, we see them, they're seemingly not just a possibility but an actual real event. I don't understand how something can be impossible when it's just the way it is. We are here on earth living, so the moon being 400 x this and that is no more weirder. For arguments sake if the moon was a wee bit smaller or whatever, I gather wouldn't experience them as we do, and thus they wouldn't be a 'thing'. Then we'd have the people good with calculators working out that if it was a wee bit bigger there would be times we would experience an eclipse.

"evx36dm","t3_clkspy","clkspy","conspiracy","unknown","I enjoyed this write up, thank you. Not sure if I agree with everything and obviously there is much speculation, but lots to think about.

In terms of the eclipse, I think impossibility is not as accurate as improbability. It is also an argument for creationism/intelligent design. But it could also be that this particular sun/moon size ratio is required to create the perfect mix of chaos and order necessary for the spontaneous creation of life and that in the same way that animals tend towards the golden ratio when optimizing physical structures and patterns, that it too is a pattern that results in this cosmic size ratio we call an eclipse.

I don't think that the moon being more ancient than the earth is really much of a mystery, however. Unlike the moon, the Earth has tectonic/volcanic activity that churns the crust like warm butter.

I'm curious if you have delved into the ancient sky theory at all? It says that Saturn was once larger and stationary in the center of the sky. It was thought of as the main celestial body. All of this is even explained in the Egyptian/Roman/Greek mythological sagas. Then a cataclysm struck and the heavens shifted to what we see today.

"evxximx","t3_clkspy","clkspy","conspiracy","unknown","I am with you 100% on the moon being an artificial construct that has been 'put' in the sky at one point.

I have an idea that the Moon is in one way, a blackmail object for our world. Consider that our world has cataclysmic cycles that it goes through. We have common myths everywhere about floods and destruction, older civilisations have myths about a planet exploding in our solar system and the sky rearranging causing untold destruction on the Earth. The geological evidence for these events is overwhelming. We also believe there to be a malicious extraterrestrial influence on the world, be it astral or physical or both. We are told the moon keeps the earth's orbit at the angle of 22ish° which apparently results in the seasons and is 'necessary' for life to sustain on the surface.

Consider this: An alien influence aware or even the cause of a cyclical cataclysmic event uses the event of barter something in return for consent to rule the survivors of that cataclysmic event on that world. Maybe it was an exchange of protection for service, an offer that may have seemed advantageous to a people's devastated by enormous upheavals. Whatever the deal, it would be frowned upon, or even opposed by other entities on a similar technological scale but a different moral orientation. However, the malicious alien influence is aware that opposition of their actions would come from their 'peers', so they devise an 'insurance policy' to ensure they are left alone. They place, by whatever means, a satellite body in the orbit of the world during the upheavals of cataclysm. This satellite body is of their creation or has been requisitioned to their purpose. It is placed with such precision as to influence the inhabitants of the world a certain way. It has the additional quality of stabilising the axial tilt from the effects of the cataclysm. Stabilising it in a way that would ensure the successive destruction of the surface of the world yet again were it ever to be removed. What this has created for the malicious alien presence is a situation where if they are opposed by an external power of their peers, the threat that if they are expelled from this world they will take their moon with them, the consequences being none of their concern. The moral nature of the opposing forces would then be forced to not directly intervene on fear of doing more harm than good.

I could of course be wrong, but if the premises I'm basing this on are correct this seems like a logical way for the situation to be structured. Potentially.","2019-08-04 10:01:53","2","Rickironhands","1747934537.451604","our planet is dying","manual"
