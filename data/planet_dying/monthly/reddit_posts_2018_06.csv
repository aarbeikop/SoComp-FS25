"8uo4s7","collapse","skeptical","Is it OK to enjoy myself while the world is on fire?","Mass shootings, violence, corruption, poverty and inequality are ravaging our planet. That without taking into account climate change. We feel powerless and doomed. I don't even want to fight anymore. I feel that because collapse is so imminent and there's no future, I should enjoy myself a little bit more. I've programmed a trip to Argentina and Uruguay in November. These would be the 11th and 12th countries I'll visit in my lifetime.

I feel selfish but there's nothing else I could do. The end is nigh. At least, I want to enjoy a little bit more before the explosion. I rally want to die before collapse starts. This world is a mess.","2018-06-28 22:45:08","71","93","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/8uo4s7/is_it_ok_to_enjoy_myself_while_the_world_is_on/","True","ed8907","1747909672.741498","our planet is dying","manual"
"8okcfr","sustainability","action-oriented","It is all in reverse - Sustainability misguided","The Ability to sustain something isn't difficult, especially when what you are sustaining was/is already there and you never had to actually work to create it, you just inherent it as it works, you just had to fall in line and sustain what ever it is.   

We are currently MASTERS in sustaining a very imbalanced system within this world. A system that we had NO say within from birth, we were born and then we were forced \(time to be honest about this part\) into an educational system that literally ONLY teaches you how to become a product/robot to sustain the system you were born into, with no question, it is just the way it works, sorry son/daughter, you must just suffer like us all through this, become an adult and destroy yourself as a child to sustain this mechanical cold system that functions off this thing that was invented called money, at ALL costs \-\-\> Literally.   


Nature as literally the living organism on this planet as one entity under one name \(nature\) makes life for all of us possible, has less space on this planet we apparently call our Mother to flourish and live and give life, than what we tiny humans take and destroy. It is truly a very strange thing to sustain, and literally to dedicate 18 years of every human to brainwash them to without question sustain such a system and imbalance.   


In reality, Nature should be flourishing at least \(minimum\) on 70&#37; of the earth surface without human interaction to have a sustainable future for all life as long as time is here.   


We are supposed to be the ones fencing ourselves off from nature, not fence off nature from us and limiting natures space. that is insanity. A lion in a cage for the sake of humans to freely abuse the land as much and as far as wide possible is a mind set of insanity, the lion should be the one able to roam free and do his natural thing that makes OUR human lives possible, and we should fence ourselves in and be the GENIUS species we are and make the best of it and have super cool inventions to do so, live that way to make life excellent.   


The world around us currently is literally a system of stupidity beyond nonsense \(NO sense\) and the majority of humanity are always functioning within their programming like robots of the first 18 years of their lives to defend and sustain this system, as if all this system needs is for corruption and war to end, then all will be sorted, never seeing it is the very system, structure, way it has all been GIVEN to you/US without you/US ever questioning it, and enforcing a very good education onto each one to never question it that deep, and to literally defend and even die for a system that has no value but money.   


Sustainability is a natural ability we all have within us, we are born with it it is in our design through how we form habits and patterns and become those habits and patterns emotionally and physically, and this is well known by those that want to control all of humanity for control through money and power, they use this inherent ability and misguide it as soon as possible to be that of a machine like system within the mind \(hence, why they want technology to be our environment, and concrete\), the thought processing, and to completely cut nature and life out of it, always making sure nature is this distant thing, this out there thing, and not the very thing giving you/us breath every single moment, because if we were to realize our very breath is nature, we would ask, where is nature then? what is happening to my breath all over this planet, we would stop sustaining this system of abuse and we would reverse this whole system to be that of nature integrity and not of money.

"8skmlj","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I consider myself pretty liberal, but the increasing calls for violence and/or death to conservatives is starting to concern me.","Some context: I'm pretty left-leaning in my views and been voting Democrat my entire life. My parents are very right wing Christian conservatives, and would never consider voting outside of their party.  

What concerns me is the backlash I've been seeing from liberals on social media, including Reddit & Facebook, that dehumanizes conservatives by calling them Nazis, animals, etc.,  including increasing calls for violence and death against them. Often it's an indirect threat like, ""these Nazis need to be taken take of"" or ""these idiots don't deserve to share our planet"", but other times it's more direct. When I make any attempt to call these comments out for what they are, it results an in immediate downvote parade and quite common responses such as, ""they've been doing it to us for years so it's justified"" or ""they're pure evil and deserve what they get"".  
Yes, as someone who is pretty left leaning, I agree that a lot of the recent policies are terrible such as the border separation. However, some are more nuanced like leaving the UN Human Rights Council because of obvious bias of its member nations. People now think that anything this administration does is immediately terrible with no nuance whatsoever. A lot of it is by my standards. But immediately escalating the rhetoric to ""Nazis must die!"" kills any meaningful discussion. I'm not saying it's the same, but you see similar dehumanizing behavior in /r/The_Donald as you do in /r/politics threads.   

Back to my parents, who I love even if we share polar opposite views on most things. They watch Fox News pretty much any time they're not watching anything else. They are constantly being manipulated, and I don't think I can fault them for that because Fox is great at exploiting their inherent fears. It goes back to the [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) and the current Republican party is the logical result of that strategy. However I don't think this manipulation of fears is exclusive to the right, and only consuming far left media can be quite manipulating as well. I understand the outrage of the left, but I don't think my parents are Nazis who deserve to be killed for their views.  

If someone has some insight on this I'd love to hear it.","2018-06-20 18:18:27","160","40","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/8skmlj/i_consider_myself_pretty_liberal_but_the/","True","oopoopoop","1747910038.286651","our planet is dying","manual"
