"8zb35z","collapse","skeptical","I really don't understand how anyone can defend capitalism as a system at this point (very relevant)","I mean, shit, I get how racist imperialists justified it in the 18th and 19th centuries, how the all the reformists through the late-19th and 20th centuries, but how the fuck do you justify it by this point?
We have entered a fucking dystopian state because of capitalism, look at our world, the top 62 fucking people have more combined weath than 50% of mankind, over 3 billion people. The bottom 50% is left to die because they either have a shitty diet or not enough food, and they die of medical problems and preventable diseases despite the fact that modern medicine can easily be put to helping them.

We are in a state of perpetual warfare, and by we I mean the West, with the United States being at the forefront of this endless war against some illusive threat based on a fucking concept that will literally never go away under the system; the enemy in the sick and starving Third World that we put to death en masse to justify why the resources can't be allocated to actually helping them and to distract from the failures affecting us in the system.

To top all of this off, the way resources are exploited, used up, and wasted under capitalism has led to such a state in which our entire ecosystem is in chaos, thousands of species die each year, even the insects are dying out, our planet is heating up at a rate never before seen and our oceans are starting to boil. All life on Earth is now under threat, including our own.

This is late capitalism, this is what the system has brought us to, mass starvation and disease, endless warfare, and the threat of extinction, it sounds like fucking Warhammer 40k, and with figureheads like Trump ramping up talks of war and hinting at ethnic cleansing we might be getting even fucking closer.

To think anyone could defend this is depressing, and to say that a return to a more pure form wouldn't simply repeat what happened originally as it faced more and more of its problems is absurd.

Fuck

"939qio","futurology","unknown","My predictions of the near to mid range future (mid to late 21st century)","I've been thinking a lot about the future the past couple days, and what might happen based on current trends. Of course there are ""black swan"" events like the rise of Hitler and 9/11 that make predicting the future accurately difficult (and impossible in some respects), but here are some of my guesses as to what the next 80 years will be like.

First of all, things that probably won't happen. 

I think there won't be a Moon base, and certainly not a Mars base or interstellar mission by 2100. It's extremely expensive to launch stuff into space, let alone build things on other planets. It might be more or less impossible to do no matter how good our technology gets.

At best we'll get suborbital space flights affordable for an upper middle class person to do once in their lifetime, and another series of Moon missions. Possibly a manned mission to Mars in the 2080s or 2090s, but I'm guessing that won't happen until the 22nd century. 

We're not going to have Matrix-like technology where you can plug your mind into virtual worlds. Brains don't work like that. At best, we might combine the resources of holodeck-like rooms with designer drugs to create a form of psychotourism, which in itself would be very fascinating.

We're not going to cure cancer, because it's a set of hundreds of different diseases. We'll continue to get better at preventing, detecting, and treating cancer, but there's never going to be a magic bullet and most likely there unfortunately still be rare cancers we can't fight for a long time.

We won't achieve immortality but we may be able to stave off aging to some degree. New technology might allow people today, or at least our children/grandchildren to live a few extra decades, and stay physically youthful for longer. However it's not a guarantee by any means as the aging process is extremely complicated.

AI and robots are not going to take all our jobs. The vast majority of jobs are much better done by people than machines. Massage therapists, doctors, accountants, shelf stockers, waitresses, actors, musicians and lawyers might be assisted with AI algorithms in the future, but they're not going to be replaced. Some services require the human touch and others require manual labor that machines can't replicate well and most likely won't be able to for a long time.

What do I think will happen? 

Although AI won't take our jobs, it will be utilized for humanity's benefit, both at work and home. People will entrust certain decisions to AI apps on their phones, AI will be used to solve complex problems in math and science, it will be a boon for medicine, it will be used to help solve crime, and many other uses.

The Internet and media will change. Social media will most likely shift away from the public Facebook/Instagram style format that's popular now and move to more private services like Snapchat. This is already happening with the post-millennial generation. 

Over the air radio and TV will eventually die out completely, or become relegated to a small community of enthusiasts, though it may take a surprisingly long time. The Internet and phone system will be the only form of electronic media.

It will probably become much harder to use the Internet anonymously, and some countries might even require people to use their real names for all their online accounts. Even Reddit now requires an email address to make an account, and many sites require you to use Facebook to log in. Due to fear of crime and cyberbullying and public desire to make such baddies accountable it's likely that Internet anonymity will become a thing of the past.

""Social credit"" systems will become more common. These will most likely be based on the good and bad deeds a person does (such as volunteering, criminal activity, donations to charity) as well as their consumption habits (buying cigarettes might lower your social credit score, for example) and other factors like their financial credit, what websites they visit and what other people say about them online. Like in the Black Mirror episode ""Nosedive"" I could easily see there being communities segregated based upon a person's social credit score in the future. This may sound draconian and creepy, but the generation now that's growing up with going through security in order to attend a concert will likely value security over privacy, and be glad that there is a system you can ""vet"" a person's character by.

Global warming, ocean acidification and plastic pollution will become much more blatantly obvious problems, and there will be many more strict environmental laws than there are now. We're already seeing the beginning of it with many communities banning plastic bags, and now California banning plastic straws. I foresee sky high taxes on gasoline, meat, and other products with large environmental footprints. 

Speaking of a gas tax, I think due to restrictions on fossil fuel use travel will be much more expensive in the future. Some people will own electric cars, but it's likely they won't ever be cheap, and they aren't an environmental ""free lunch"" either with their toxic batteries and may also be taxed. A transatlantic airplane ticket might cost $10,000 or more in 2060 because of carbon taxes. Immigration and foreign travel will decline. People will move from suburbs to cities, and there will be more focus on creating walkable neighborhoods.

Our main fears will change. No longer will Islamic terrorism be the main threat in people's mind. I predict a ""quiet revolution"" in the Islamic world, with devotion to the religion declining within the next generation and belief itself falling in the generation after that. Al-Qaeda is dead and ISIS are dying; I think Muslims are embarassed of their image and this kind of terrorism will decline in the very near future.

What will take its place? Most likely, far right terrorists who use violence to fight against social justice movements (we've already had a couple of well-known hate murders by alt right men), and also far left Malthusian eco-terrorists who use violence to fight against overpopulation (even though birth rates will most likely still be plummeting in the future, there will still be lots of people who think the problem is too many people as the world population will still be growing linearly). Most people will condemn both kinds of terrorists, but a shockingly large minority of people will quietly agree with one side or the other, and the left and right will argue about whether the bigoted right wing terrorists or the misanthropic left wing terrorists pose a greater threat.

The good news is crime and violence will continue to decline, as we'll have better ways to prevent and detect criminal behavior thanks to AI (and yes, the erosion of our privacy) and better psychological knowledge.

Another change I see is a large anti-meat movement. I think we're going to see a huge surge in vegetarians and vegans, predominately among women at first.","2018-07-31 00:37:31","0","14","0.46","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/939qio/my_predictions_of_the_near_to_mid_range_future/","True","aretheyaliens","1747912151.625586","our planet is dying","manual"
"8x3z3j","conspiracy","unknown","The Saturn Moon Matrix","So a lot of people have been talking about the Moon being a trap for souls. I have a theory on how it all works. This theory may not be too different from David Icke’s, but I believe I may be adding some new insights on Saturn’s connection to the mandela effect, AI, DWave computers, and CERN.

In the ancient past Saturn was associated with Kronos the god of time. Kronos is where we get the image of Father Time and the grim reaper from. The grim reaper carries a scythe because Saturn was also the god of harvest. As well of the god of judgment and a lot of other things. Saturn basically was THE god and most importantly the god of TIME.

Kronos heard a prophecy that one day one of his sons would usurp him as king - so like any rational god he ate all his children. The symbolism here shows us that time consumes everything it creates. It also shows us where Satanists got child sacrifice from because Saturn is actually Satan.

Not only is Saturn the 6th planet from the sun, but it also has a large hexagonal shaped storm on its North Pole. A six sided shape. You can easily find pictures of this taken by NASA. Scientists don’t know why this is. But if we look to cymatics (the study of how sounds affect materials) we can hypothesize that there could be some sort of frequency creating this geometrical shape (since we know regular storms do not form perfect angles).

Oddly enough, a low frequency sign tone creates a hexagon in a medium (such as water/sand/whatever). I say this is odd because the sine wave looks like a serpent, like Satan. Also reminds me of the Uroboros (the snake biting it’s own tail to representing infinity) Kind of a stretch, but the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine? What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave? Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true. Now we’re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $. Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil.

Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun, has a 6 sided shape on its North Pole, AND the 6th day of the week is Saturn-day! The black mass! The day satanists worship.

Now if you take a hexagram and draw some lines on the inside you get a necker cube. This is an important symbol, the cube of Saturn. You can find them everywhere. Do a google search on them. They are even a part of the world’s largest religions. Certain sects of Jews wear mini black cubes on their head when they worship. Muslims go to Mecca to worship at the Kabba - a giant black cube! They even walk around it counter clockwise like the rings of Saturn. The United Nations have a black cube in their “meditation room” as well.

Now let’s take a look into pop culture  - the cube is all over the place here as well. And of course we, the conspiracy theorists, know “THEY” love to hide little messages about what “THEY” know in the movies. 

The transformers features a powerful robotic cosmic cube. Hellraiser features a magical cube that takes you to a hellish dimension. The avengers features a “tesseract”. The name tesseract literally means 4 dimensional cube - the fourth dimension being time. A Wrinkle in Time features a tesseract as a way to travel across space and time. Interstellar also features a tesseract - the weird dimension behind the bookshelf in existing in the past, present, and future. Funny how the wormhole they go through at the beginning of the movie was near Saturn.

My favorite movie however is 2001 Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The movie features a black cube like structure capable of transporting things through time. Astronauts from the future find this monolith on one of Jupiter’s moons. Ironically, the story originally had it as one of Saturn’s moons but for some reason it was changed. When they find it it emits a loud FREQUENCY.

Is this what’s inside Saturn? A Black Cube emitting a low sine tone? I kind of think so. It reminds me of the Star Trek episode where this one planet is run by a computer that manifests the thoughts of people’s worst fears.

My theory is that Saturn is a supercomputer of sorts, an AI intelligence, that has created a matrix for our souls to get lost in. Remember how Elon Musk called AI “the demon”? What if we already created it long ago and we’ve been trapped in a time loop? History repeats right?

Saturn’s rings work like a giant broadcasting system, and the frequencies from Saturn are being amplified through them and sent to the moon and relayed to Earth. Our brain has been highjacked by this satanic frequency and has made us experience this false reality or illusion.

I forget the name of the scientist but there’s a whole book on it “Saturn’s Ringmakers” or something like that - that talks about how there’s photographic evidence of mile long alien ships building the rings and fixing them up. Maybe they’re reinforcing their machine? And maybe “they” are the reptilians and need this matrix to cause us distress and suffering so they can feed off our negative energy.

Now there’s still a lot more to this. The DWave quantum computers are designed to look like... giant black cubes. Now who uses these? CERN. Both are thought to be responsible for the mandela effect. Have scientists hacked the matrix and found a way to edit reality? Is there a massive quantum computer inside Saturn? Is CERN a portal to Saturn/hell? I also want to talk about language and how it’s the code/software that programs this matrix. Using the languages of this world only solidify the illusion but we can actually use our words to bend it. This is what spells and incantations are. Or what we call today affirmations. But I have to get some sleep - hopefully people are interested in hearing the rest.","2018-07-08 19:24:36","338","361","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8x3z3j/the_saturn_moon_matrix/","True","nickhintonn333","1747912246.8976572","our planet is dying","manual"
