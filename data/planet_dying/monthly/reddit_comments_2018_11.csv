Several reasons. Here’s my two cents worth. There is no countervailing social/political/economic narrative to growth/capitalism.

Economists explain, with varying degrees of patience, that economic growth isn’t dependent on energy or “stuff”. That the financial industry is as valid as is a potash mine. More so. This narrative permeates post secondary education and is firmly entrenched in the centre of the [Overton Window.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window)

The fall of the USSR, and the cultural impact and language made it nearly impossible to correctly identify liabilities vs assets. Especially in the language of wealth creation. Farmers are assets. Miners are assets. Cooks are assets. Creating wealth. Social workers, managers health care workers are economic liabilities. They require the wealth created by others, but produce none. Smoke and mirrors.

Tl;dr - we can’t think straight, and our language is contributing to the problem.

""It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism."" – [Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism (pdf)](https://libcom.org/files/Capitalist%20Realism_%20Is%20There%20No%20Alternat%20-%20Mark%20Fisher.pdf)

> Understood in its totality, the spectacle is both the result and the project of the present mode of production. It is not a mere supplement or decoration added to the real world, it is the heart of this real society’s unreality. In all of its particular manifestations — news, propaganda, advertising, entertainment — the spectacle is the model of the prevailing way of life. It is the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have already been made in the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that production. In both form and content the spectacle serves as a total justification of the conditions and goals of the existing system. The spectacle is also the constant presence of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of the time spent outside the modern production process.

Take for example Apple: even though it's a highly profitable & healthy company, P/E is rather low. From an economic standpoint, Apple is 1 of the few companies actually making a profit based on sales of actual tangible products & services. It's cash reserves are massive. For investors though, it isn't enough. 

Any result that is less than accelerated growth is evidence of a poor investment, which from a fundamental standpoint doesn't really make sense.

&#x200B;

However, continuing growth like it has for the past 15-20 years is impossible. It's a mathematical certainty that there is an upper limit to the value of the company based on sales. How could they possibly increase share prices another 10-100 fold without taking up most of the entire value of the US stock market. So in a way, it's success will be it's downfall by the sheer math of it all.

It's all amazingly counter intuitive, it's really hard for institutional investors to see what investments will be making sense, i think it's one of the reasons they are flooding into the housing market again, buying up actual real estate instead of the mortgages.

The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production. The mass proliferation of images and different forms of media and information make this 'mental production' especially strong in our time compared to previous ones. We also live in a particularly inopportune moment when no broad political force is available which can articulate a proper alternative to capitalism. As such there is no popular perspective ""from the outside"", as it were, and capitalism is taken to be totalizing, necessary, and natural. We're even taught skewed perspectives on past civilizations and social arrangements: that they were in some sense 'proto-markets' or proto-capitalist societies. Even historical memory, where it still exists, has been colonized by ideology. 

This is just the context in which people are thrown to compete for survival. Most people get shitty educations and live in poverty and broken communities/households that make even decent education ineffective. Most people aren't concerned with systemic and socio-political analysis, they're concerned with the necessity of the immediate: work all day and then you still have to cook or get food for the kids, take care of all your stuff you accumulated, and so on, until they finally have some time off--your only time to get a breath in the week, do you sit down and struggle through difficult news and complex readings? Or do you smoke some weed and stream netflix?

If you want people to follow you, you need to lead by example.   Reduce your personal consumption as much as you can.    That step is the most important because it shows you have skin in the game, and aren't a hypocrite.  This is where Al Gore fucked up.   He told people they need to do something about climate change but then didn't really do anything to change his lifestyle.   Modeling the change you want to see also gives other people who are interested a working example of how they can change their own lives.

Coercing people to do the necessary thing, especially in a representative democracy, will only lead to resentment and backlash.  Change happens from the bottom up.

"e9lspzm","t3_9wiepd","9wiepd","conspiracy","unknown","2012 was an interesting year for me. I've been calling it ""year zero"" ever since.

Starting in 2011 I had the feeling that our dimension was 'wobbly' for lack of a better description. By 2012 I had speculated that our dimension was collapsing.

As we approached December I expanded my theory with vision quests. I learned there where 11 dimensions similar to our own (prime) and that this cycle of expanding and collapsing happens every 6000 years or so.

1 dimension exists until a glitch occurs, some bit of information that can't be parsed correctly. The result is a copy being made, a nearly identical dimension with one alteration. This stabilizes the original dimension and life continues on until it happens again.

The first few copies are all made from the original (prime) and are very stable as a result. After the 3rd or 4th dimensional parallel is created, copies of copies start occurring. This is what eventually leads to dimensional degradation as we approach 11 parallel dimension. This cycle has existed for ever, 1 dimension giving birth to 10 alternate dimensions with increasingly different parameters.

11 seems to be the magical number as dimension 12 brings forth the collapse back to 1. As the 12th dimension is formed, the original 11 are destabilized and instead of a fully formed 12th parrallel, we get a pocket dimension instead.

This pocket dimension is un-anchored and 'floats' through the others, absorbing them in the process. Eventually all 11 dimensions are absorbed and we're left with one single dimension once again... For now.

The effects of this are subtle and nuanced, impossible to observe yet impossible to ignore.

The 'twilight zone' feeling will be present in everyone, even those benefiting from the merging, as we all know things aren't exactly as they were yet can't verify it.

The world as we knew it ended in 2012. As our reality was merged with 11 others and your 'soul' was recombined with your duplicates... It gets complicated but yea, that's my theory.","2018-11-13 06:49:30","21","MaestroLogical","1747919033.460812","our planet is dying","manual"

Which, in consequence, destroy our universe. That idea of our consciousness being copied and transfer to a super computer makes a lot sense to me. The only thing not clear to me. It's how they did trick all of us (collectively) into transfer our consciousness to the super computer? They can't force our will. They have to create a ""suggestion"" in order for us to accept it.","2018-11-12 22:08:01","14","aje_35","1747919033.465494","our planet is dying","manual"
"e9lllhu","t3_9wiepd","9wiepd","conspiracy","unknown","I do think the “old world” ended in 2012. I’m hearing everyone including the news talk about things that only hardcore conspiracy theorists used to believe, like “Trump talking about the caravan to distract from Healthcare”, or election fraud. It’s like all of the things conspiracy theorists have been trying to point out all this time, the news took and is using against Trump. People are pretty much almost totally “woken up” at this point. We’re just in the early confused stages of waking up, where half of the country that woke up first, are for trump, and those that are just now waking up, think that the media is still trustworthy and are against trump. 

I think this is great. Once the Trump presidency is over, both Democrat and Republican politicians will no longer be able to use smoke and mirrors to “blind the masses”. People are more aware now than ever before. 

We’re finally stepping into becoming a more advanced civilization. I don’t think 2012 was the end of the world, more, like a clock, the end of an HOUR.

Also, I've alway felt the Alan watts quote you mention is not really about simulations in simulations but more about the hologram/fractal nature of reality in which every 'node' in the network contains the information of the entire system and that it is actually the same. Everything is one.

You mention the point of singularity. It is not the end of time, but the source oneness of everything. It's like our results from modern sciences are 'inverted'. It's actually the source, not the end. Our modern science looks at the observable world, which is the collapsed moment of reality that is simulated from the infinite in that instance, based on the interference of energy systems instead of looking at the holographic state within the system as a whole in which it arises (before it collapses to create that moment of reality). The simulation is momentary, yet constant, like the refresh rate on a monitor/screen. It's actually flickering really fast but our eyes can't see it. This is like reality.

Similarly, if we point a camera with the same refresh rate as the screen we see the banding effect. I think our dimension is tuned into a certain dimensional wavelength and other dimensions are either the other notes in a scale or the way octaves work in music (everything is frequency and vibration).

We see a simulated realty arise from the oneness at infinite times per second. If we could sink up with the rate of the simulation we would 'see through it' and see the base layer of oneness. Part of me thinks this dimensional hz has something to do with the golden ratio/phi and the fibonacci sequence.

It requires a bit of a shift in perspective and I'll edit this tomorrow with more info. ","2018-11-13 09:23:23","5","RDS","1747919033.487666","our planet is dying","manual"

"e9m0lgo","t3_9wiepd","9wiepd","conspiracy","unknown","Around 2012 is when WW3 started, but it’s not a normal war, no one noticed it really. It’s a psych war, waged online by first dismantling trust in systems of democracy in the West by exposing actual corruption of those systems and politicians etc. But this wasn’t about rooting out or stopping corruption it was about preventing citizen backlash against the economic and foreign policies of the past 4 decades that have so entrenched wealth inequality and injustice and basically making humans wage and debt slaves. The war is waged by a tight global network of extreme neoliberals through think tanks lobbyist groups corporations alternative media and through social media. The aim is to make people see the corruption in their system and then turn for salvation towards an even bigger enemy, who will use their support to subvert democratic processes and further entrench the power and wealth of the ‘elites’ or a group of elites through authoritarian policies for citizens while liberalising markets banks etc, basically ensuring a return to a kind of feudal society. 

This is why everything has seemed insane, the truth has been totally decimated by this war and entire populations are divided into two alternative realities. They used the conspiracy theory community to get the first cracks in, unfortunately. I don’t think we have a hope of winning until the guys from the old system admit to their crimes, the new guys are far far worse and their psychological manipulation tactics so successful that they literally have their supporters so faithful that they defend their blatant dishonesty and crimes. The whole Russia thing isn’t really relevant because it’s not about nation states it’s about individuals with incredible wealth and power, some from Russia, some from lots of different places.

"e9lskb0","t3_9wiepd","9wiepd","conspiracy","unknown","So after the 13 billion years, the universe is estimated to have existed for, you're telling me that RIGHT NOW, as in DURING MY LIFETIME that the 'world has ended.' I'm not saying that it couldn't have happened, or that we aren't in an elaborate simulation, I'm purely stating that the chances of that happening are so unbelievably low! While I'm at it, I'll also talk about the possibility that we are in a simulation, is that not ridiculous in itself? Not to forget, is there even a reason for having us in a simulation? Finally, although there are current, ongoing wars and recent terror attacks the world doesn't seem to be getting worse, but getting a lot better and more peaceful. In my relatively short life, I've never experienced a world war or a major terrorist attack. So how could it possibly be getting progressively worse? If anything, it's the complete opposite of 'the end of the world' but a rebirth (If the world has already ended). Who knows if the world has ended already, but I know for sure that the world isn't getting worse and the endless news stories of rapes and murders we see and hear are only a result of technology/media growth.","2018-11-13 06:45:17","2","Exige311","1747919033.504213","our planet is dying","manual"

Idk if that year has anything to do with time travel or other dimensions, but i've been looking for answers ever since and most likely will be until I die.
