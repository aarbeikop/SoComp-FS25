It makes sense that as the ice melts it accelerates the melting process as more CO2 is dumped into the atmosphere. The ice caps are a result of the last ice age and will melt away as they always have. Then inevitably there will be another ice age that will cause the reformation of the ice caps. The poles are just the last parts to melt away, they are not a fixed existence. Also scientists say the sun is about to enter a cooling cycle that will see temperatures worldwide drop despite global warming. I believe humans have an impact but the US pollutes much less CO2 than other world powers and within 100 years the world will be electric anyways. I don’t buy into that climate change will destroy humanity. The planet is in a constant state of flux(with or without humans).

It’s the dominance that’s so prevalent in their society. These wealthy conglomerates are the product of endless generations of patriarchy, hierarchy. religion, capitalism, and plain old dominance over the fellow human. That domination of humans opens up the prospect of domination over nature, and that’s the mind frame that they’re wrapped in. The only thing that could change this is if we started banding together as communities and rejecting this dominance, establishing our own mind frame; a complete societal revolution. But of course due to the division inspired by the state and the wealthy, we’re still trapped in hating eachother based on economic status, race, sex, etc... I think ecological issues can only arise because of social issues. There was a time when our limited technology prevented us from impacting the environment on a massive scale, even though Kings and nobles still used their power for complete dominance over the people. With the development of the industrial revolution, the same people and the same problems that plagued old society were simply transmuted into the new industrial society. Now we have kings and nobles in the form of the state and the rich, and they exercise this power to dominate the people, destroy the environment, and endlessly grow, because due to that mind frame of dominance it becomes a feasible thing to do. Coupled with a top down state system that provides the mechanisms and threat of violence (police, military) to use that power wherever and however, and an economic system based purely on growth or death (capitalism), the motives behind the crisis become clear.

But that took the a Millenia or longer for these changes to occur. Humanity on the other hand. Has caused immeasurable changes in what’s equivalent to the blink of an eye. We evolved, which was natural, but we evolved into a form that should not have survived. Our higher intelligence was our greatest evolutionary asset but was also our Achilles heel.

"emjsuts","t3_bkvipn","bkvipn","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I can relate a lot to the things you feel. I feel pretty hopeless in this world too. Im sitting here working the night shift at a shitty hotel, and you get to see the entitled asshole side of people here a lot. When I was your age, I had so much optimism and hope for the future, and now that I’m seeing the world for what it is, and how much we’ve really fucked up, I don’t want to do this here anymore either. 

It feels like deep down I know something will happen, and I’ve felt this way for the last ten years. I haven’t found a career path that A) interests me and B) contributes in some way to something good as well as paying my bills. I haven’t made any roots or connections to this earth like buying a house or whatever, I have one kid that I had in high school, and my grandparents who won’t be here much longer, that’s it. I’m just riding out the days we have left and enjoying myself until then. Well, that’s not all I’m doing. 

I’ve gotten myself immersed in the world of psychedelics, and I am pretty convinced that stuff like DMT and psilocybin are the keys to the answers we need. Look up the stoned ape theory, it’s fascinating. What my plan is for the time being is basically to learn all I can about the other dimensions, about myself and the true nature of my soul, as we are primarily non-physical beings and physical beings second. The way I’m preparing for death is to know what happens, and where you go. It’s not some fairy tale mystery that can’t be solved, that’s just what “they” want you to think. DMT is the closest I’ve gotten to the feeling of death and going to the other side without actually dying, and ai can tell you, it’s pure bliss to be released from this prison-like meat sack we inhabit. 

This feeling for me also has gotten stronger after I started watching the Earthlings documentary. So far I’m 1/3 of the way through, and I couldn’t even keep my composure, I was sobbing like a little child. I’m sick of this world, and I don’t think we will pull ourselves out of it, and it’s like we are just driving full speed into a brick wall as a species, and there’s a few of us who think we should use the breaks, but everyone else calls us crazy and it’s not that fast, and we have so much time before we hit the wall. 

Just stay true to yourself, man. You seem like a genuine person, and eventually, good things will start happening somehow. The world is generally run by the psychos who get ahead where honest people suffer, but I can feel the dynamic of reality slowly changing, even on a personal level for me. I have been more protected, seemingly lucky, and opportunities are showing up right when I ask for it. All I know is that consciousness is all around us, no matter how fucked yo the world is, you have you, and if you care, you will be cared for.","2019-05-05 08:53:04","-3","[deleted]","1747928904.780759","our planet is dying","manual"

This entire subreddit is meaningless, more or less, since the crisis will not be solved by individual action. It can't be solved by individual action, because individuals aren't the problem.

Ships, that burn the nastiest fuel available because it's cheap and not regulated outside the three mile limit. Planes, that spew gigatons of filth into the atmosphere, way up high where the damage is really bad. Industries that pollute like mad because it's cheap to pollute and expensive to be sustainable. And yes, cars - but one ship is the equivalent of thousands of cars. Which brings us back to the whole ""individuals can barely affect the situation at all by doing personal sacrifices"" thing. 

Instead of spending energy on ""zero waste"" and feeling all self-righteous, do something meaningful. 

Like work to end capitalism, in favor of a system that isn't a nightmare.

One direct benefit of zero waste IS reducing carbon emissions, whether that’s your reason for doing it or not.

It’s sort of like when politicians and experts tell people, “A hurricane is coming, and you’re all going to die!  Evacuate!”  People leave, and then nothing happens.
