_Our actions have negative consequences for other people and have historically; you have to decide how much you care about it, but don't kid yourself into thinking there aren't any consequences.""_

I think one of the least discussed but most important issuea facing the western world is our lack of empathy. We are tribe like in our ancestry, sure, but it's clearly not impossible to think beyond your own friends, family, city, country. People could have successfully done it if they had the capacity to see the people in other countries as their fellow man. But smart, deceptive and deep pocketed people have made it their mission to make those other people into just ""others"" by using people's fear.

There's no conspiracy here; no bilderberg, illuminati, or secret elites. What there is, is a collection of systems cobbled together which have, accidentally or not, encouraged narcissism and a lack of empathy. Perhaps not a lack, but at least restricted to immediate groups. ","2019-01-30 15:21:10","52","[deleted]","1747921547.101417","our planet is dying","manual"

"efdikcd","t3_alen3f","alen3f","vegan","unknown","Let's be clear on something here: honey bees are an imported invasive species. Crops had been cultivated by humans in the Americas for thousands of years without ever having known what a honey bee is. [Other pollinators have been crowded out by the forced presence of the honey bee, but many aren't extinct yet](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/01/27/581007165/honeybees-help-farmers-but-they-dont-help-the-environment). We _could_ be encouraging their natural involvement, but we force the use of honey bees instead... because honey.

On my own property, I build bat and wild bee habitats (mostly bumble bees; google for ""bumblebee boxes"" or ""bat boxes"" for more info), and my garden and wee orchard flourishes for it. Heck, a lot of the reason that we ""require"" the use of bees is because we've specifically selected plants that require help pollinating; e.g. [not all almond trees require pollination](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/23/471437025/with-bees-in-trouble-almond-farmers-try-trees-that-dont-need-em), but the varieties opted for in California are not of the self-polinating varieties.

Keep in mind also that veganism isn't a philosophy of perfection. It is *""a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude —* ***as far as is possible and practicable*** *— all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment.""* As it's not presently ""practicable"" by most to purchase animal-free products which don't involve honey bees, it's still in alignment with the philosophy of veganism to make those purchases. However, just like the bone char used in sugar or the bits of animals used in car tires, this is one of the issues that will go away all on its own as we move society's consciousness towards greater compassion.
