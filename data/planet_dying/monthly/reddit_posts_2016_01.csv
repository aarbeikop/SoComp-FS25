The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has to provide proof for significant human-caused climate change; yet their climate models have never been validated and are rapidly diverging from actual observations.  The real threat to humanity comes not from any (trivial) greenhouse warming but from cooling periods creating food shortages and famines.

Burden of proof

Climate change has been going on for millions of years -- long before humans existed on this planet.  Obviously, the causes were all of natural origin and not anthropogenic.  There is no reason to think that these natural causes have suddenly stopped.  For example, volcanic eruptions, various types of solar influences, and atmosphere-ocean oscillations all continue today.   We cannot model these natural climate-forcings precisely and therefore cannot anticipate what they will be in the future.

But let’s call this the “Null hypothesis.” Logically therefore, the burden of proof falls upon alarmists to demonstrate that this null hypothesis is not adequate to account for empirical climate data.  In other words, alarmists must provide convincing observational evidence for anthropogenic climate change (ACC).  They must do this by detailed comparison of the data with climate models.  This is of course extremely difficult and virtually impossible since one cannot specify these natural influences precisely.

We’re not aware of such detailed comparisons, only of anecdotal evidence -- although we must admit that ACC is plausible; after all, CO2 is a greenhouse gas and its level has been rising mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. 

Yet when we compare greenhouse models to past observations (“hindcasting”), it appears that ACC is much smaller than predicted by the models.  There’s even a time interval of no significant warming (“pause” or “hiatus”) during the past 18 years or so -- in spite of rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 levels. 

There seems to be at present no generally accepted explanation for this discrepancy between models and observations, mainly during the 21st century.  The five IPCC reports [1900 to 2014] insist that there is no “gap.”  Yet strangely, as this gap grows larger and larger, their claimed certainty that there is no gap becomes ever greater.  Successive IPCC reports give 50%, 66%, 90%, 95%, and 99% for this certainty.

http://admin.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2016-01/195958_5_.jpg

Needless to say, there are no sufficient conditions to establish the existence of any significant ACC from existing data.  Even necessary conditions based on empirical data, like temperature vs altitude and latitude, cloud cover, precipitation, are difficult to establish.

To summarize, any major disagreement of data with models therefore disproves ACC.

IPCC’s models are not validated -- and therefore not policy-relevant

In other words, GH models have not been validated and may never be validated -- and therefore are not policy-relevant.

Anyway, any warming observed during the past century appears to be trivially small and most likely economically beneficial overall.  Careful studies by leading economists and agricultural experts have established these facts [see for example NIPCC-ClimateChangeReconsidered-II – 2014].

http://admin.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2016-01/195957_5_.png

I therefore regard the absence of any significant GH warming as settled; note my emphasis on the word “significant.”  Policies to limit CO2 emissions are wasting resources that could better be used for genuine societal problems like public health.  They are also counter-productive since CO2 promotes plant growth and crop yields, as shown by dozens of agricultural publications. 

Surviving a coming climate cooling

I am much more concerned by a cooling climate -- as predicted by many climate scientists -- with its adverse effects on ecology and severe consequences for humanity.

Singer and Avery in “Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1500 years” have described one form of observed cyclical climate change.  It was first seen during the past glaciation.  Loehle and Singer claim evidence for these cycles to extend into the present.

In particular, historical records identify the recent cycle of a (beneficial) Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the (destructive) Little Ice Age (LIA) with its failed harvests, starvation, disease, and mass deaths.  Many solar experts predict another LIA cooling within decades. 

http://admin.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2016-01/195956_5_.png

I have therefore explored ways to counter the (imminent) next cooling phase through low-cost and low- ecological-risk geo-engineering, using a specific greenhouse effect – not based on CO2. 

At the same time, assuming that our scheme does not work perfectly, we need to prepare for adaptation to a colder climate, with special attention to supply of food and sustainable water and energy.

The outlook for such adaptation appears promising – provided there is adequate preparation.  However, the coming cold period will test the survivability of our technological civilization.

I dedicate this essay to the memory of Prof “Bob” Carter, my fellow-panelist, NIPCC co-author, and travel companion in Western and Eastern Europe, China, and all around the USA.     ""He died with his boots on.""

"42r3in","environment","emotional","Emergency Alert - No Soil & Water Before 100% Renewable Energy","Many say we can have 100% renewable energy by 2050.
 This is factually incorrect.

We can have 100% renewable electricity production by 2050.

But, electricity production only amounts to 18% of total world energy demand.

82% of total world energy demand is NOT electricity production.

The other 82% of the world’s energy is used to extract minerals to construct roads, cement, bricks, glass, steel so we can eat and relax. Solar panels and wind turbines will not be making cement or steel anytime soon. Why? Do you really want to know? Here you go.

Total World Energy Demand = TWED
-----------------------------------------

18% of TWED is electrical grid generation.

82% of TWED is not electrical grid generation.

In 20 years, solar-wind energy is up from 1% to 3% of TWED.

Solar-wind power are projected to provide only 6% of TWED by 2030.

When you hear projections about solar-wind generating 50% of electrical power by 2050, that’s really only 9% of TWED.
100% of electrical production is 18% of TWED.

But, it takes 10X as much solar-wind energy to close 1 fossil fuel power plant simply because they don’t produce energy all the time.

That means it will take 10 X 18% of TWED to close all fossil power plants.

Research says it will take 4 X 82% of TWED for a 100% wind-solar energy transition.

10 X 18% + 4 X 82% = 100% intermittent TWED.

To get the same total power we use now, we would need several times more intermittent energy. Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid infrastructure. Such infrastructure is hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades, demanding more energy and additional trillions of dollars.

Solar-wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have to replace them all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil sources.

Solar and wind power are an energy trap. The real reason solar panels are so cheap is because China manufactures and ships them to 75% of the world’s solar market. China ignores all safety and environmental laws and has a very low currency.

It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6-12 solar panels.

China will build 6 nuclear plants per year until 2030 and they want about 400 by 2050 because they know they can’t build solar panels without nuclear power.

Business As Usual = BAU
----------------------------

In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.

In 15 years 20% of humanity will be severely short of water.

Right now, 1 billion people walk a mile every day for water.

In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says Scientific American. Humanity’s soil is eroding away and being degraded at 24 million acres per year. This number will increase with severe droughts, storms and low-land floods.

50% of Asia’s low-land rice paddies are threatened.

50% of humanity depends on rice to survive.

A 100% TWED transition will take 2 generations to get done — minimum. It is a vastly more difficult and complex goal than you are told.

We are losing earth’s soil and fresh water faster than we can effect 100% renewable TWED.

In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the British Foreign Office.

In my opinion, in 30 years we won’t have enough fossil fuel for a 100% renewable TWED transition.

This is the most important fact I’ve learned:

Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

Humanity will destroy its soil and water faster than we can switch to renewable energy with BAU. Without massive political-economic change, civilization will collapse with 100% certainty. But, don’t worry, I like to fix things.

Animal Agriculture = AA
--------------------------

Humans + Livestock = 97% of the weight of all land vertebrate biomass

Humans + Livestock = 80% of the cause of all land-air extinctions

Humans + Livestock = 50% of the use of all land surface area

Humans + Livestock = 40% consumption of all land plant growth *
 
* Net Primary Production.

50% of the soy grown in South America is shipped over to China to feed their pigs. Rainforests are cleared to grow animal feed and the required fresh water is, in reality, diverted to China. The Himalayan mountains are heating 2X faster than the planet and many fear that China will run out of water in 15 years by 2030.

50% of China’s rivers have vanished since 1980.

60% of China’s groundwater is too poisoned to touch.

50% of China’s cropland is too poisoned to safely grow food.

Animal agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we can effect 100% intermittent energy transition with BAU.

7 billion people will not stop eating meat and wasting food without major incentive. Meaning a steadily rising carbon tax on meat. Just saying that can get you killed in some places.

Without using James Hansen’s 100% private tax dividends to carbon tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die. 100% private tax dividends means 100% for you, 0% for government.

100% for you, 
    0% for gov.

We have to act now, not 5 years from now, or forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation because there’ll be no one left to remember us.

Michasel Mann says we will lock-in a 2 degree temperature rise in 3 years for 2036 with BAU. Ocean fish will be gone in less than 25 years.

We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 60% of your carbon tax money. This is in direct opposition to Hansen’s tax dividend plan and immoral. I strongly believe your carbon dividends should be in a new open-source world e-currency directly deposited to your phone to be phased in over 10 years.

James Hansen repeated at COP21 that his 100% private carbon tax dividends would unite Democrats and Republicans because government would be excluded. Socialists like Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to control that money. They are divisive and confrontational and Republicans will never accept their revolutionary dreams. We don’t have time for this endless fighting. We only have time to unite and nothing unites like money. Environmentalism in the 21st century is about a revolving door of money and power for socialists, and not the environment.

What humans & livestock have done so far:
-------------------------------------------------

99% of Rhinos gone since 1914.

97% of Tigers gone since 1914.

90% of Lions gone since 1993.

90% of Sea Turtles gone since 1980.

90% of Monarch Butterflies gone since 1995.

90% of Big Ocean Fish gone since 1950.

80% of Antarctic Krill gone since 1975.

80% of Western Gorillas gone since 1955.

60% of Forest Elephants gone since 1970.

50% of Great Barrier Reef gone since 1985.

80% of Western Gorillas gone since 1955.

40% of Giraffes gone since 2000.

30% of Marine Birds gone since 1995.

70% of Marine Birds gone since 1950.

28% of Land Animals gone since 1970.

28% of All Marine Animals gone since 1970.

97% – Humans & Livestock are 97% of land-air vertebrate biomass.

10,000 years ago we were 0.01% of land-air vertebrate biomass.

Humans and livestock caused 80% of land-air vertebrate species extinctions and occupy half the land on earth.

1,000,000 humans, net, are added to earth every 4½ days.

You may well wonder how I know all this, and I would like to tell you that when my dog Loki licks my face during a hangover I can hear his mind talking to space angels, but the reality is that I’m an old man who cuts grass in a trailer park in Canada and there’s not too much else to think about, so take it from me, you can search any statement, just don’t get bogged down so you can’t see the forest for the trees.

"439csc","PoliticalDiscussion","unknown","Do we think that a Bernie presidency would actually usher in the ""political revolution?""","As a Bernie supporter I am a big fan of his social policies but I also have no illusions that electing the man will mean *passing* said policies. He would still have to deal with *the* most obstructionist conservative party in modern history. 

Now, with that said I still support Bernie because I am of the mindset that electing Bernie isn't really about Bernie. I believe that electing Bernie is twofold useful: 1) it brings democratic socialism into the forefront of the US meta-narrative and 2) it makes it possible for people like me who have political ambitions and also consider themselves democratic socialists to be considered mainstream enough to be elected.

1) If you have taken the time to read through this post then you already know the history of the word ""socialism"" in this country since--I'd say--the 50's when the capitalists and religious leaders teamed up. However, if I am not mistaken the millennial generation is now the most numerous voting block. I am in said block. Now, granted there is a chasm of ideas between different people groups within that generation. For every 10 people you've got 50 opinions on any one topic. However, we are the first generation who has readily accessible information about the rest of the world at our fingertips. As the country moves forward I have a hard time believing that as the older generations die off that those who are younger now are not going to be influenced by what they know of places like Scandinavia and certain Latin American countries where people are happy and have robust social programs. I think electing Bernie is a referendum on democratic socialism. Electing him forces self-described liberals to ask themselves: ""Am I a part of the business party (the Republican/Democrat) or do I believe in actual concrete social investment where the government has a role in lifting up those who cannot lift themselves for whatever reason?""

2) With that referendum is supposed to come this ""political revolution."" Again, Bernie will still have an obstructionist Congress. However, I think that part of Bernie's plan would be to introduce legislation to the American people that would directly benefit them and then let the Congress shut them down *so that in the midterms we could elect more progressive candidates who would pass his legislation*. When the time came and his ideas hit Congress they would be shut down immediately. I have no illusions about that. *However*, (and here is my question for you all), would the American people listen to Bernie's programs, see that they would directly benefit, and stay engaged? Furthermore, would more progressive candidates come forward? Even furthermore, would said candidates even stand a chance against the business party because SuperPACs would still exist for the rich to buy their own candidates. Bernie has 40 years of experience to appeal to voters with. What have I or others like me got? Passion and good ideas? Sure. Money? Nope. Because if we follow in Bernie's footsteps then we wouldn't take SuperPAC money. But then how do we get the exposure we need to win when the Kochs and Goldman Sachs could just give my opponent enough money to yell me out of the building with enough TV ads to swamp a commercial break?

My TLDR question is this: will *you*, yes **you**, stay engaged during a Bernie presidency? Would you still go out and support progressive candidates by knocking on doors and making phone calls? Or are you satisfied to let the process handle picking our leaders and letting *them* decide what's best? I'm worried that our culture has become so saturated with celebrity, entertainment, and mass media that making an appeal for a continually engaged public is a Herculean effort at best and impossible at worst (some of whom for good reason [i.e. single mothers working two jobs to take care of her kids]).

I am an unabashed progressive and Bernie supporter but I admit that I was slightly swayed yesterday by a post that I read about Hillary being a corporate bought shill not being such a bad thing because maybe she actually could bring politicians together. But for what? More handouts to insurance companies? More drilling of our increasingly decimated Planet? More latitude for Wall Street to gamble with the economy and our future? More placating Saudi Arabia so we can keep our hands saturated in oil? 

I personally am done with messiahs. President Obama (at least in 2007) was my last hope for an individual who would single handily change the country. He became as much of a centrist as any other Democrat. Now, does that make him an historic president? Absolutely. But it doesn't make him a change agent. It makes him just another product of the business party system. Bernie cannot himself change things anymore than Obama could. So, how does it come? You and me continually engaged.

So, are you willing? Will you keep working toward a more progressive America under a President Sanders or has our flashy-ADHD-corporate-bought-consumer culture just made it impossible to stay continually politically engaged?
