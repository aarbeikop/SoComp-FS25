"dx9bzo","climatechange","action-oriented","Co2 controlled climate change is a lie and here's why. Co2 can only absorb -80 at peak.","""The glaciers are melting"". ""homes are burning"". ""Polar bears are starving"" ""July is the hottest month on record"". ""People are dying!"" ""We're in the beginning of a great extinction""  - Greta.

There's about 1000 different sub categories to debate and argue to no end. But none of that stuff matters. Is there climate change? Perhaps something is going on. Is it unprecedented? Maybe yes, maybe no. There's graphs and charts, historical temperature records and all kinds of hand waving pointing to ""climate change"".  Except, no one talks about CO2.  The climate discussion begins with co2 and ends with subjective arguments over graphs, rain and droughts instead.

Have any of you actually thought about co2? What questions would you ask to inform yourself enough to make a decision about it? They say co2 is a pollutant and it ""traps"" heat.  Is that true? Can heat be ""trapped"" ? Is co2 really a pollutant? The answer is no to both. We can debate that if you like but the questions need to go deeper. What would be the first and only question about co2 that you really need to ask? To end this charade once and for all?  Seeing all roads lead back to Rome, the debate starts and ends with this. How much energy can co2 absorb?

Most of you here on Reddit are probably young, still in school and getting thoroughly indoctrinated by know-nothing teachers who jump on the climate change bandwagon with little to no thought. What do you imagine when your teachers tell you heat is being trapped by co2 and it's going to continuously warm the planet? They tell you IR heat from the planet can't escape to space. Ok, sure. Did you ever ask ""how much heat"" can't escape to space?  If you did ask, can your teacher answer? Probably not.  Did you ever ask how much co2 is in our atmosphere? The answer is only .04 %. But wait! there's more!

Ask your teacher how much energy co2 absorbs.  Now, are you imagining co2 is absorbing ALL our heat and sending it straight back to earth in the form of  ""back radiation""?  Well, you would be wrong.  Water vapor makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases, but even if that doesn't make you reconsider co2's power, consider this. Co2 only absorbs light (IR) photons which are only 15µm wide. That's 15 microns. What does this mean?  It means 15µm is the weakest, coldest part of the IR spectrum. How cold? 193 K or  -80 Celsius. That's COLD. Or rather, more specifically, that's heat! Absolute zero Kelvin is the coldest you can get. That's when molecules stop moving. So even 193K is still considered heat.

Light waves, in the simplest explanation, is like a spring or a slinky toy. The smaller the spring, the more energy it contains. Stretch the spring out, the less energy it contains. X-rays, gamma rays etc, stuff that will kill you, is in the 1-2 µm range or ""short wave"".  However, after visible light hits the earth, it converts to long wave energy. Most may know this already. However, even an ice-cube emits LWIR because an ice-cube is not absolute zero Kelvin.  It has heat.  But like I said, 15µm is of the weakest part of the IR spectrum which co2 absorbs and you don't have to take my word for it.

Wien's law is the formula used to derive temperatures of a black body (something that absorbs all light waves). It's how we know the temp of stars, by analyzing the color of light being emitted and applying Wien's law. So what happens when you apply Wien's law to the IR spectrum of 15µm?

Do it yourself. Don't get overwhelmed by the formulas and numbers. Just edit the wavelength field to 15 then select micrometers from the drop down to the right. Hit =.  No need to worry about the other fields, they will populate accordingly.  What's the result? 193.18 K or -80C.

In conclusion. The atmosphere is warmer than -80C and it is an absolute impossibility for co2 to make it warmer with heat/energy that is -80. That's colder than my freezer and in essence, alarmists want you to believe temps colder than my freezer will overheat our atmosphere and planet.  Bring this up next time your teacher goes on a rant about ""climate change"".  This is the only argument we need to be having.

"dqumoe","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","I am secretly an anti-natalist","I don't think humanity is worth preserving, tbh. We do awful things to each other and the planet. And the universe likewise does horrible things to us in return.  

Our own lives hold no meaning anyway (I'm not into existentialism), so what's the point of all... this?

I don't want any kind of dramatic apocalypse though. I don't want to see anyone in pain. I just think we should stop forcing more people into this shitshow of a life. Let humanity die of old age, peacefully in it's sleep. 

I don't talk about this outloud. I have friends who have kids. And they're cute kids. 

And they're going to get sick, experience disappointment and heartbreak, and die. At the minimum. 

So yeah, I secretly think people shouldn't have kids.","2019-11-03 02:37:02","5","6","0.65","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dqumoe/i_am_secretly_an_antinatalist/","True","questions6486","1747939167.770864","our planet is dying","manual"
"dqu4lk","conspiracy","unknown","Ancestry DNA kits are a scam","What's stopping ancestry DNA companies from selling your genetic data to health insurance companies so that they can deny genetic disorders you haven't even been diagnosed with yet as pre-existing conditions? In the future, when we're living under the boot of a totalitarian regime and mankind is overpopulating a dying planet, what's going to stop the government, who possesses all our genetic information, from killing off the genetically weak so that there's enough resources for those they deem worthy? What stops a company from firing or refusing to hire someone, or a bank from refusing to give a loan, or a renter from refusing to lease to someone based on their genetic makeup outside of the confined terms of race, ethnicity, or sex? What compels someone to pay money to give away their genetic information to a company that sells that information to other parties?
