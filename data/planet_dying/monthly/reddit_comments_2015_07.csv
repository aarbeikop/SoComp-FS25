"ctmudr3","t3_3f7v00","3f7v00","TrueOffMyChest","unknown",">The depression I sometimes feel stems from my own mortality.

I beg to differ. The depression surrounding the fact of mortality is a conditioned response programmed into us by our culture. It is not innate, nor is it natural nor is it necessary. 

>I understand death and I'd rather not participate in it.

If you understood death, you would know that you will in no way be participating in it at all because you will no longer exist to participate in anything. 

>Obviously, everyone feels this way.

This is a highly questionable assertion. Like most superlatives, it is spurious and glib. How can you possibly know what everyone feels? Because I sure don't feel that way! The thought of eternal existence makes me queasy. Eternity in the human form does NOT appeal to all regardless of what you may believe.

>my only problem is that I'm going to die from aging

If that's your only problem, you're doing very very well in life indeed except when it comes to understanding, insight and wisdom.

>acceptance of death is morally correct

No no no. Acceptance of death is NOT a *moral* issue at all. Why do you think it is? 

>I'm going to be known as dumb unless I succeed

Only in your own mind.

>I do not want to die

The fear of death is not innate nor universal. It is a socially conditioned response created primarily by religions to manipulate ignorant human beings.

Be careful about what you wish for. You may not know of what you speak. What if, after the death of the physical body, there is another form of existence that is less limited than physical embodiment? I'm not saying there is, I'm just suggesting that you may not have considered all of the alternatives to eternal embodiment as a human animal.

Do you mind if I ask if you are a Jehovah's Witness? Because the Jehovah's Witnesses believe the best possible reward for living in conformity to certain rules is to *gain eternal life in the human form on a paradise earth*. That seems to be what you would like to win as well. I urge you to consider the wisdom and appropriateness of what you desire and whether or not eternal existence as a human animals is truly the ultimate outcome.

I don't mean to be insolent but I think you must be a very young person who is struggling to make sense of what it means to be human. If so, please *don't stop now*.

""The powers that be"" want us to consume. They want increased population growth every year. If GDP and population is not going up, something must be wrong. That's how they see it.

They also see infinite growth, like one giant Ponzi scheme. Of course that's not possible. A warning was issued in the 1990's by the Union of Concerned Scientists, some 1,700 of the world's leading scientists, including the majority of Nobel laureates in the sciences;

""The earth is finite. Its ability to absorb wastes and destructive effluent is finite. Its ability to provide food and energy is finite. Its ability to provide for growing numbers of people is finite. And we are fast approaching many of the earth's limits.""

http://www.ucsusa.org/about/1992-world-scientists.html

Of course they're just scientists, so politicians don't have to listen to this small group.

Here's something to cheer you up though. According to BP, there is only 53 years of global oil reserves. And while there are many **alternatives** to oil, there are no **replacements**.

"csvo65m","t3_3bw9ya","3bw9ya","vegan","unknown","I guess I missed this post from like 5 days ago...

We do deserve what is coming. Or at the very least, those who are spending tons of money to blind society do. It's crazy because I feel like ten years ago, the only ""problem"" I had heard of was that we would run out of fossil fuels to burn sometime in the next couple decades. I was totally unaware that there were any issues about climate change, extinction, CO2 levels. Then again, I had no idea that eating animals is the main contributor to not only our own sickness but all of those issues. And I have always paid attention in school and the news etc.

The reality is that those who profit from industry don't care about the planet, and the more people consume and buy, the more money the company makes. And these large industries have paid massive amounts of money to blind everyone, even educated people. NO ONE can drown out their advertising dollars and lobbying except person-to-person information and the free internet. And it's helping, but most people still just watch TV and are blocked from knowing the truth.

It tears me up inside knowing what will happen to the world in the coming decades. It will be insane. It will be devastatingly sad. It will be dramatic and drastic. I do all I can to educate people.

Having said that, while reading your post, I realized something. I am probably a minority on here (I am religious), but oddly enough, my faith believes that after catastrophic earth events, there will be a cleansing of the earth by God/nature, and all will be well. I don't know how that's going to go down exactly. I don't know if that means God will actually cause some major events to help the earth counteract the devastation we have caused to the atmosphere etc, or if somehow natural processes of the earth that we are yet unaware of will, through catastrophic events like major volcanoes etc, somehow undo the damage and restore a clean slate of sorts. Perhaps the earth will be slightly different. My faith believes that it will in fact take on a ""higher"" state. I don't know what that will be, but it sounds cool. Imagine if that could really happen, and if somehow, it really will all work out and be even BETTER than it is now.

With that in mind, I still do all I can to help the best environmental practices move forward. We can't give up. We should always do all we can.

But the fact that nature/God could just *possibly* have a trick up its sleeve is fairly calming to me. Or at least reassuring.

What was especially cool for me to discover awhile back is that my religion actually fully suggests not eating animal products, but I had always heard the teaching interpreted in the wrong way. Many members of my church are becoming vegan as we're coming to see the science and the truth (that animals are not in fact the happy cartoons on the packages) are helping us correctly interpret our scriptures.

Although of course, regardless of my religion, I would have become vegan. Once I saw the truth I just had to do it! It was just cool, after I changed, to see that my religion in fact fully suggested a vegan lifestyle.","2015-07-08 01:00:33","1","[deleted]","1747846745.519312","our planet is dying","manual"

There is something about this that has me thinking. space is big. We send out radio signals on accident. The earth is buzzing with em emissions since the dawn of radio over 100 years ago. 

The Jodi Foster movie Contact (bad bad bad) involves some aliens bouncing Hitler's 1936 message back to us from Vega with coded message inside so we can build a wormhole machine to go say hi.  (so many problems with this, but anyways...)

Well, the message leaves Berlin in 1936 and by 1937 it is one light year away. When I put 1 light-year into the formula we get 12 square light years of surface area for the sphere of universe this same radio signal is now covering.  By 1938 the same message signal is now spread out over 50 square light years, 4 times as much area meaning 1/4 the power. by 1939 when Hitler getting his breathing room it is now 113 square light years. it is 1/10 the signal power. We haven't even gotten to Alpha Centauri yet.  At Alpha Centauri 4.3 light years away, we have a signal spread out over 232 square light-years close to 1/20th the original signal strength. It is cosmic background radiation by now. 

We could probably send a really high powered and focused signal to specific stars, but of course that would require energy, and choosing which of the 500 stars in within 50 light years to ring the bell and see if anyone is home. 

And all of this assumes that these technological aliens even use radio. human cultures don't follow the same technology tree, we should not assume non human, non terran, alien cultures will bother with radio, or need it, or consider it useful.
