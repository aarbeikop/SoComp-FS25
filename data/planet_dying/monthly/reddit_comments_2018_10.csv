The issue with posts like these is they don’t hold much information OP, it’s just statements. If you’re aiming to change people’s mind you need to work on sources for the statements and formatting the post in a way which is clear, concise and looks less like a ramble.

"e70mb70","t3_9km9pa","9km9pa","vegan","unknown","I don't want to sound discouraging but these are just the rough notes for a useful statement. 

It might be useful to go back and refine exactly what you are wanting to achieve and who you are aiming this at. Strip it down, clarify it, structure it more clearly and post it somewhere that doesn't already probably agree with a lot of what you say, in a way that they will listen to without it feeling like too much of an attack. Which is tricky ;)

But to get back to the first part of your piece, we eat meat because it tastes good. It tastes good because it contains a lot of things that are very useful for our bodies. Our taste buds are evolved to go for high value items like that. It is one of the reasons we also crave fats and sugars so much that we harm ourselves eating too much of them. Eating meat can also be bad for us in the long run, but throughout most of history we usually didn't live long enough for that to be a widespread problem, so the benefits of eating meat far outweighed the harm. Now we are in a very lucky stage of our history where we most of us do not need meat anymore and more of us are living long enough to see the harm as we get older. But using other animals has been a huge part of our culture for so long and our taste buds are so designed to go for high value food items that it is very difficult for people to adjust to the idea. I hope that helps.

"e7q13xo","t3_9nxzzh","9nxzzh","conspiracy","unknown","There are much better ways to go about this. 

First, 60-120 people is way too many. A trip like this is 10-12 people tops. Second, this is not a one way trip or suicide mission. Saying so is just being dramatic. 

If you are asking strangers to die for the cause then how about you outline your qualifications or background that warrant that type of commitment? Do you know the actual vicinity of the ""entrance""? 

Vice release an article last year on ""modern hollow earth"" and the most interesting thing for me was that \~10 years ago an expedition was planned for \~20k. My thought was, that even if double or triple the 20k, I would pay that to be part of a trip like this no matter the outcome. 

Given above, I actually started looking into legality and cost of making such trip. It's not nearly as difficult, risky or costly as people would think. Nobody has done it because, assuming you trust the data, its well documented. All that aside, if the only barrier to proving or disproving this theory is 3-4 weeks and a moderate budget I'd still be down. ","2018-10-14 00:46:21","134","matthew2735","1747917318.4247181","our planet is dying","manual"
"e7q3ln5","t3_9nxzzh","9nxzzh","conspiracy","unknown","The North Pole? Entry into inner Earth...? The North Pole locates on ice mass, which is floating on the Arctic Sea. Thickness of the ice is only some meters but the sea depth is over 4 kilometers (>13000 ft). This has been measured independently by US (USS Nautilus) and Russia (using submersible device designed and built here in Finland).

So, good luck with that. Remember to pack your deep sea diving gear to your sleds too...

(Edit:)

This is the funniest read today. Just to point out some other good bits:

*""Must be unmarried, and willing to die for this cause.""*
BUT THEN:
*""have no intention of dying like Leonardo. This is not a risk we are willing to take.""*
BUT THEN:
*""I am considering it a suicide mission.""*

I was about to shout out loud *""make up your minds, please!""* but then I realized they all are really going to die. They just can't take the risk of dying like *Leonardo*...

But first they have to take a boat ride across the frozen waters. Well, in Finland we just *walk* across the frozen waters, but who cares, you can try a boat. Just make sure it's not named Titanic, because: *Leonardo*.
