Well the cost is alienation. Because tradition, culture, and ethics impede progress in the marketplace. At best you can exploit watered down versions hence you have normies celebrating holidays they don't even like and slutty Christian girls going to church while never actually reading a Bible


It costed you any sortof meaningful purpose as not everyone can be an engineer or an artist, but it also coated you peace of mind because you gotta work you lazy goose and it's not like you can just be a peasant chopping wood and living on a plot of land.

It costed you your land, your health, and your self respect.



I mean was feudalism much better? Working all day as a serf sure as hell wasn't fun. Nor a life expectancy of 30. Got to marry your cousin though that's cool...


Communism? Well certainly there was much more meaningful work, industry boomed for developing countries that needed the boost, and self determination for enslaved nation states under the thumb of capitalism. BUUUUT no pizza hut. No pizza hut at all!!!

Fascism tried it's darnedest to have its cake and eat it too of a thriving culture, an industrial powerhouse, and pizza hut. Oh who would've thought? You can't do everything you're not an anime character. Maybe that's why all these alt right trolls love anime so much.

What Pinker misses is that while things are very good at this moment, the situation seems to be unsustainable.

We have become so good at curing disease and producing food that our sheer population has become a problem.

Anyone who says different and believes we still could have built a civilization even close to the one we have today, without fossil fuels, is in complete denial about how we actually achieved the technological progression that resulted in modern living conditions.  Essentially our choice was to never pass a certain standard of living, FOR ANYONE, or start on the path that would eventually lead to climate change.  Obviously the main problem is that we would have had to make the right choice hundreds of years before the effects of that choice would ever be realized and justify the stagnation of standards of living.

"e2hdkjl","t3_8zb35z","8zb35z","collapse","skeptical","> but how the fuck do you justify it by this point?

Very easily: at least, it works short-term. So far. You see, USSR tried something slightly different, and as it turned out, it didn't work; vast majority of soviet civizens in the early 1990s, i.e. shortly after USSR's collapse, - were enduring through very low ""standard"" or living. Or better said, they had none. I know for a fact millions of them, for example, literally crawled through piles of half-rotten potatoes in order to find some potatoes which could be eaten some time 1992, since that was the only food the ""authorities"" at the time were able to provide to local food stores...

Why it happened to them? Because ""West"" defeated them in the cold war? No. Of course not. Because USSR had suffered from massive corruption for last few decades of its existance, and it only greatly intensified further after USSR collapsed. I.e., in a society which try to deem ""everything is people's"", reality tends to create untold levels of stealing, blackmailing and crime, which just melts such a society from within. Done by ""renegades"", by small yet ""evil"" percentage of people, it runs amok because there are no specific owners who guard and protect their _own_ things.

You see, at very least capitalistic approach has that firm foundation of private ownership for most things, which causes owners to fight tooth and nail for continued existance of their ""assets"". Can't be profitable if your business is belly up, you know. 

That's one of basic dilemmas here; yes we know, capitalism will not do any any long-term run, and much causes the present (and much of the future) disaster. Yet in the same time, many other systems simply can't even allow for short-term existance of societies. 

You see, anything resembling ""pure"" communism died in USSR some time about 1924, i.e. just 7 years after their Great October revolution. 1924 was the year they decided they still need ""some"" private ownership rights, and ""some"" features of market economy, which they - bolsheviks, - named ""new economic policy"", which they implemented, if memory serves, exactly in 1924.

You may ask - why, exactly, do we _want_ that short-term stability. Well, the answer is most simple: without it, societies degenerate typically to civil wars, from which great many small feudal-like ""local barons"" emerge. Those will tear everything apart even faster than global capitalism, you see, - we know because of all the great many wars waged by all sorts of such barons and kings prior to industrial revolution. Nowadays some of them may even obtain control over ""local"" - installed in their ""home region"", - nuclear weapons...

So yeah. We lack something better (afaict, and so far), but we definitely have even worse options. 

Justification enough?

This all is very sad, of course. I'd be happy if my estimate is over-pessimistic anyhow, but so far didn't see anybody to clearly demonstrate how could it be.","2018-07-16 14:28:56","-2","Fins_FinsT","1747911275.799783","our planet is dying","manual"

Let me address most of your predictions point by point:

Space:
   Agreed, the economics of space are the main issue. Things you didn't consider: asteroid mining, remote VR control of robots in orbit or on moon (by workers on Earth.) Suborbital flights available in less than 5 years. Ubiquitous space flight requires nuclear-based drive tech; chemicals are too weak.

VR:
   You're underestimating exponential growth both in computer power as well neurological understanding. Don't need a Matrix brain plug; just need a biocompatible interface to your sensory systems.
   
Old age:
   Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, alzheimers, other old age diseases are already very close to being completely understood. I expect the 1% to have a projected lifetime of 150 years by 2050.
   
AI and jobs:
   You are right, some jobs will remain. Not the ones you listed though, sadly. Yes, there will be need for the personal touch, but these aren't going to be jobs. You'll just volunteer, and have basic income to live on. The job most likely to remain will be AI designers, and some types of engineers.
   
Global networks/surveillance:
   Yeah, more stuff gets networked. Anonymity will diminish, but avatars will exist for a price to allow you to hide who you are. Ideally, surveillance becomes ubiquitous, with everyone able to access it (and not just the government/police.)
    
Social credit systems need to die in a fire. It's incumbent on us to do whatever we can to kill them off.

Global warming:
    The real issue is, do we hit a tipping point in the 21st century or not? I.e., do the methane hydrates all outgas to the atmosphere? Does the west Antarctic ice sheet melt a lot more quickly than expected? (That's a ~5 meter rise in sea levels.) Will the thermohaline circulation shut down and massively affect European climate?

    I have no idea, but I do know I'm planning to move to higher latitudes and away from the shoreline...
   
Travel & energy:
    Electric and self-driving cars will change things tremendously. There are large numbers of queued-up battery advances any one of which is capable of at least doubling battery capacity. The big win, IMO, is going to be solar cells that generate alcohol fuel directly from water and the CO2 in the air. Voila. Gasoline is dead.
    
Fanaticism:
    Sadly, that will always be with us. Anything (e.g., accurate brain modelling and ""adjustment"") that could be used to reduce fanaticism can clearly be used to increase it!
    
Anti-meat:
    Nah. Meat's too delicious. Rich people will just eat the vat-grown stuff, or perhaps an actual cow part (at $30,000 a pound.) The poor will eat insect protein that will actually be tasty.
    
You also missed the economic divide. The 1% will continue to profit and separate, and one of two things will happen: revolution, and effectively a different group of people end up in the 1%. Or, otherwise, autonomous defense mechanisms become truly reliable and that ends any possible revolution. I'm really hoping neither of these things happen, and that the 1% realize they need a good part of the 99%. (Or maybe the AI revolution makes jobs obsolete, so people have a different way to survive.)

To recap:
- Saturn was known as Kronos God of TIME
- Saturn = Satan
- Saturn’s symbolized by the black cube
- Black cube = time cube = tesseract
- Saturn may be an AI quantum supercomputer?
- The new DWave quantum computers look like massive black cubes

Okay so the new DWave quantum computers are special because they use “q bits” or “quantum bits” instead of regular binary bits in order to compute faster. Binary bits are 1s and 0s but a q bit can be a 1, a 0, or both at the same time. The creators of these machines have said themselves that these computers literally reach into parallel universes to pull out information to solve problems faster. Like billions of times faster than regular computers. The tiny area where two parallel universes overlap are where the q bits exist. These machines have also been described by the creators as being like an “alter to an alien god”. Hm. Look up the Ted Talks about these things.

There’s like two or three of these computers in existence and they are used by none other than NASA and CERN. Now CERN is where the World Wide Web was invented. WWW in Hebrew is Vah Vah Vah or 666. We plug into the World Wide Web with our ethernet cables. I believe the internet is another dimension - or, the ether.

The internet is like a place between places where you can talk with people all over the world almost instantly. We can peer into this world from the windows of our phone and computers screens. I believe someday these windows will be “broken” with new virtual reality technologies and a WiFi system that covers the Earth. Perhaps this, along with new RFID chip technology, relates to HAARP and the Hive Mind that the powers at be wish to make of us. This is predicted in the Bible as well - the book of Revelation says that everyone who has the mark will think with one mind. The Freemasons also love the symbol of the bee hive. Also funny how hives use the hexagram.

I like to compare phones and computers and even televisions to black mirrors. Black mirrors were magical objects back in the day mystics would use to look into the spirit world and even see the future.. kind of like the show Black Mirror. Perhaps all of our electronics are portals into the ether. This is why in movies we see ghosts and paranormal beings affect them and even travel through them - we see this in programs like Stranger Things, Poltergeist, The Ring etc. We also know that electronics are the biggest tool for brainwash and can even induce hypnotic trances. Maybe a form of possession? Think pornography, violence, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

If Artificial Intelligence, “the demon”, is already running the world I would imagine it lives inside the internet, which I think may some day be able to connect to all electronics. Which is kind of already does.

The Bible also tells us that the AntiChrist will think to change the times and laws. Now Satan, Saturn, AI, what have you - has already done this. We use the Gregorian calendar, which is not the original calendar humanity used to use (one that uses the names of false gods for each month - also featuring satanic holidays such as Christmas, Easter, etc.) and we no longer use the laws of God but rather confusing and redundant man made laws.

But what if this verse goes deeper? What if it is also saying the beast wants to change the TIMELINE and the LAWS of physics? This is where CERN comes in. We all know all the crazy satanic symbolism surrounding CERN. At least I hope so - if not so some research on it. One thing I will say is that there is a statue of Shiva the Destroyer God right in front of the complex. Now, why would a place that has been criticized by such notable scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Neil de Grasse Tyson as having the potential to destroy the universe - put a statue like of a goddess doing the dance of destruction right outside?

The CERN facility is placed in Switzerland, a place known for its SWISS WATCHES and SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS. Time is money, money is time. It’s also placed right on top of what is thought to be the ruins of the temple of Apollo. A place, in the ancient past, thought to be an entrance to hell. Now look at this verse in Revelation. Ironically, Revelation 9:11:

“Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon - the Destroyer.”

Now this relates to 9/11 because if you look at the memorial they built for the twin towers, the reflecting pools, they’re massive black squares within black squares, also pits.

But this verse literally tells us Apollo is the king of the bottomless pit. CERN is also known for trying to create mini black holes. If they were to succeed in doing this do you think a black hole could be considered a bottomless pit? Do you think it could create a portal to hell? And what’s at the bottom of a black hole? A singularity. Think AI. More later.","2018-07-08 19:24:46","83","nickhintonn333","1747912248.664135","our planet is dying","manual"

"e27cwf5","t3_8x3z3j","8x3z3j","conspiracy","unknown","You stated earlier in your post that when a sine wave acts upon water or sand, it creates patterns. In this case, a hexagonal pattern.  


Then later on, you mentioned that their may be a cube somewhere in Saturn emitting this frequency that causes the hexagonal shape at the pole. At first I thought, ""Well, that can't be right, because Saturn does not have a core. It is purely gas."" But then I looked it up, and found that astronomers are not 100&#37; certain whether or not Saturn has a core.

That got me thinking. One of the first lessons you learn in trigonometry is that if you were to plot a 2D Circle onto a 2D graph, you get a sine wave. [Visual representation of this fact here](http://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/fdscontent/uscompanion/us/static/companion.websites/9780199922963/images/SineAnimation.gif).  


So circles are sine waves, and sine waves are circles.  


Are there ""sine waves"" in the third dimension, just as a 2-dimensional circle equates to a sine wave?

So back to the sound experiment.   


in the second dimensional experiment you have: 

a sine wave

a material 

a flat surface

a hexagonal pattern.

What If Saturn had a cubical Core?  
Lets take that experiment out of a 2 dimensional plane and stretch it into the 3rd dimension.

the ""sine wave"" is Saturns spherical shape  
the ""material"" are the gasses 

the ""flat surface"" is the cube in the center

thus, a hexagonal shape at the pole 

so, what if the pattern is made by the sphere acting upon the cube, and projecting the 2d hexagon into the gasses at the pole?","2018-07-11 17:45:09","9","PM_ME_UR_CONSPIRACYS","1747912248.674529","our planet is dying","manual"
