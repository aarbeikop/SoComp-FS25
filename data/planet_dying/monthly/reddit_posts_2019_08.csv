"ctx2po","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","Wouldn't it be more impacting to state about that we are killing the human being instead of incentive people about saving the planet?","Nowadays, all environmentalist and people willing to fight for climate change have (almost) always the same approach and try to tell us that we are killing the planet, but beside all the animal, insect and vegetation on the planet, on a strictly chemical plan, the planet actually don't give a single damn about what we do on it. She was a big magma sphere, she suffered multiple mass extinction, and she's still spinning around the sun like the good old days. 

My point is, because I am convinced about that the choices of words matter a lot to build up the way we think about everything and matter even more when the the underlying goal is to incentive people to act. Then why always caring about this poor mother nature when we should focus on our own survival, the coming suffering from breathing, eating and drinking. 

You may argue this is the point of view of a catastropher. But I am not saying we are all going to die or anything close like that, I am just asking you to think about all the posters you saw about the environment, all the lectures you heard, even the way we talk about the planet : it's mostly about her with a feeling of guilt, and not really about us with compassion and a profound wish for a healthier future.","2019-08-22 12:58:07","3","7","0.71","https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ctx2po/wouldnt_it_be_more_impacting_to_state_about_that/","True","needbill","1747933817.8067179","our planet is dying","manual"

I recycle, I use public commute as a way of transport, I even put up an insect hotel in my garden to help solitary bees and other insects with finding a home, but none of that seems to matter on the grand scale of things.

So what of I use public commute as a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions?
Big corporations will still refuse to alter their schemes to make a few extra bucks before our planet becomes null and void.
So what if I try to help out bees - the most important pollinators on the planet?
The temperatures are getting more extreme than they have ever been and there's more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there's ever been, so bees will eventually die out as a result.

A handful of years ago I met an amazing man who is now my husband and we are finally at the point in our lives where we want to start a family. Honestly? I'm excited. I'm more than excited. I'm ecstatic, but I'm terrified. I'm terrified because of the kind of world we may be leaving him/her. I'm terrified because everywhere I turn the news is saying that humanity is going to die. There are politicians and people in high places who are putting everyone in danger because they want to make profits. 

I'm terrified because everything I have done since I was a kid to help bring attention to climate change feels worthless. My single action of voting doesn't make a damn difference anymore. I feel hopeless and I so badly want to be able to raise a small family, but do I really want to help bring a baby into a dying world? Do I want to pass this burden off to my kids? Do I want them to feel the fear that I'm feeling on a daily basis? 

It's not even worthit. No matter what we do the future is grim. I don't know if I actually want to have kids anymore just because I can't go one day without hearing how the planet is dying.

"cuw0w2","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","The current climate change discussion reminds me why Mass Effect 3 poorly reflects how international politics work","Let me explain. (Spoilers for Mass Effect 3 obviously) I'd like to preface this by saying I understand that Mass Effect 3 is a video game and is not a reflection of how the real world works at all, but this is just something I was thinking about recently while reading a lot about climate change, and for whatever reason Mass Effect 3 and its ""save the universe with the help of everyone"" plot line came to mind.

So when Mass Effect 3 came out a majority of the discussion was about the lunacy of the ending. Personally I don't find it as egregiously terrible as most, as I think a majority of the game is quite good, but I'm not here to talk about that. For those of you who are not familiar with Mass Effect 3, essentially the game revolves around the main character Shepard preparing for the upcoming apocalyptic invasion of the Reapers. The game (and series) are much more complicated than that but I won't be going much further into the plot line than that.

The game begins with Earth being invaded by the Reapers. Now even if you haven't played the games I think you can understand that that is a big no-no. In the context of the game it is an inter-galactic travesty, similar to some relatively smaller scale tragedies happening today do to climate change, no? Just go with me.

I bring up the comparison because climate change in modern times is treated by many as just as devastating as the reapers. 5,10, 15 years until irreversible damage including global temperature increases, rising sea levels and global food shortages. Apocalyptic circumstances, some might say.

Following the invasion of Earth and the universal epidemic of the Reapers invading, Shepard manages to use ""politics"" to solve all issues with the help of his companions and magically solve millennia long conflicts between the various alien species in the game. What a guy.

For example, he cures the Genophage of the Krogan race(essentially universal birth control for the species), the century long struggle between the Geth and Quarians(Quarians were kicked out of their homework by Geth), and manages to unify all governmental bodies to throw their full support into protecting the Citadel and destroying the Reapers. Pretty fucking amazing that he does that in such a short amount of time, right?

Now at this point you may be wondering why the hell I'm bothering with this comparison. It's a stupid video game, who cares. Art never reflects reality, right?

There's a quote from Mass Effect that I always found quite powerful. ""Stand in the ashes of a trillion dead souls and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence is your answer."" Pretty interesting quote right?

Except you can't really ask ghosts questions, so I guess it doesn't really matter. Only living people get to answer questions, because only living people matter, right?

So I'd like all you people who have already condemned yourself to death in the next couple decades to ask yourself how much your opinion really matters as a dead person. Do you think because you preach to others about going to war over the Amazon rainforest or declaring a global emergency over climate change it's actually going to happen? Sorry to tell you, but those who are living, the people with all the power, don't care much. They actually don't care at all about your pleas or your ""conspiracy theories."" To them, saving the earth for the global population is not hope for their survival. It’s hope for the general popualce’s survival, which doesn’t have quite as nice of a ring to it. They don't hope to allow the earth to be sustainable for the future. All they care about is their own ability to adapt, and those with the real money won't really have a problem with rising sea levels. they have plenty of other things to worry about.

Now I'm not saying that anyone is wrong about what they think is going to happen due to climate change. I'm not a climate change expert or a scientist, but I'd like to think I have a decent grasp on how people work. But I might be wrong.

Shepherd unifying all species to stop a universal threat may seem within the realm of belief in Mass Effect, but in real life? Truth be told most of the people in power don't give a damn about the dead or those who will be dead in the future. There are definitely some that think they can unify the world against a global epidemic, what you could call ""the good ones.""

But those who fall to the allures' of honor, greed, sloth and power are not the ""good ones,"" and unfortunately they have the power in most cases.

So how do you change the minds of the powerful? Well you have two options in my opinion. Appease them, or take away their power.

In Mass Effect 3, Shepard goes for appeasement. The Quarians will help if they get their homeworld back, the Krogans will help if the Genophage is cured etc. Are their situations like this in real life where it would be possible to appease those killing the planet?

Well I'm not sure. I'm not a politician. But at the very least there's not much us regular folk can do outside of voting (which by the way, I implore you to do). I'm sorry to say that I don't think there's much you can do individually to stop the Brazilian government from cutting down the Amazon rainforest. So what about taking away their power?

There are a lot of people calling for violence and war to do such a thing. Personally, I'm not in favor of violence at all. I don't see how a global conflict to stop rising powers from using their resources would do anything other than make things worse.

So is that all you can do? Patiently vote and hope that someone with power will help the world out?

In Mass Effect 3 there isn't much information about how the regular people react to the Reapers. You know how all of the main characters react to the solving of all interspecies conflicts, but what about the regular people? How did they react?

Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I'd like to think they did what they could. And that's where I guess I get to the point of this.

Do what you can. Vote. Make little changes in your life. Try your best. Sure, raise awareness I guess. But worry about yourself, Don't get stressed about the people in charge and what they're going to do because there isn't much you can do about them.

Little changes in your life may seem inconsequential, but they really aren't, and I say this as someone who scoffs at the ""small"" requests that many environmentalists make. ""Use less wood, paper, plastic, oil, electricity, beef, dairy etc."" I would ask those people who request people to cut out essentials from their lives if they actually think the common person is going to listen, because I don't think they will. Don’t act like completely changing your lifestyle is within the realm of reason for most people. if you actually want some change, drop the apocalyptic angle.  

Implore people to simply do what they can. It's the best you can ask for. We ain't getting a Jesus like figure in Shepherd to come save us, and waiting for the general populace to ""wake up"" isn't doing much. So do what you can. Can you cut back on beef to help the world? I hope so. It's not much to ask for, but if it is, fine. Not like me yelling at you is going to change much anyway. I can only control myself.

""I fight for freedom. Mine, and everyone's. I fight for the right to choose our own fate. And if I die, I'll die knowing that I did everything I could to stop you. And I'll die free.""

Yeah, that helps, but I feel like I shouldn't have to explain that animals are dying, getting raped, enslaved, etc for their tastebuds. Dude this is like a holocaust (and I do NOT use that term lightly) for animals but there isn't anyone that cares enough. I have gone almost 5 years being a vegan that never talked about the issues or would say something that would make someone feel bad. I care about humans and to help all of us we need to go vegan or at least MAJORLY cut back on animal products. 

I hate being overly emotional and I hate being ""that vegan"" but people try to bully me to eating meat but the second I open my mouth about animal suffering and the planet I'm the bad guy. I might as well be ""that vegan"" and start really sticking up for animals because guys tons of them are dying every year and I've kept my mouth shut for 5 of them.

"cnwzlz","futurology","unknown","Society should shift towards a technology and science focus and away from consumerism and amassing wealth","It seems that humanities' current purpose is largely to make money, pay taxes, and die. If you're able to escape to a different purpose it still revolves around your capacity to earn money, which usually is driven by a consumer based economy, pay taxes, and die.

If you're an artist, you are typically only making money if your art can make money for someone. For video games, if there isn't a profit involved then it doesn't get made. People sacrifice quality and passion to drive profits. But what are these profits after all? Essentially they're the individual's ability to amass more wealth and that wealth is used to amass more consumer goods. 

What if, instead, a higher emphasis were placed on advancing science and technology for the betterment of all of the planet? If everyone looked away from consumer goods and could contribute to a higher purpose, then even mind numbing jobs would have more meaning than simply acquiring wealth for consumerism and survival. Instead, now you're working to improve the advancement of all of humanity, because your tax contributions (for example) are focused on giving all of humanity greater advancements in science and medicine and tech which would, in turn, make life easier and enriched for everyone. 

The excess wealth would not be amassed by individuals which is sat on and squandered, but it would expand and enrich these pursuits which have the primary purpose of automating processes and providing solutions to problems which all humans face. 

Imagine if a medical program had trillions of dollars at its disposal worth of power, instead of a few hundred humans having that wealth between themselves for no reason other than that they invested it half a century ago? 

I know this is a radical attack on our current principles and economics but I think that we need to make a drastic shift because the rates of suicide and depression are very obvious indicators that humans are not content with slavery to a perpetual system of stepping on each other for the sake of profits and increasing individual bank accounts. 

Cant we, instead of *fighting* and hoarding for a better future, work towards sincerely creating as close to a utopia as possible without individual wealth and power being a concern? What if there is simply a solution through future tech that every human can experience happiness and have all of the necessities they require for a healthy and fulfilling life? What if it doesn't involve owning mansions and drowning in excess? What if that could be experienced through future virtual reality for personal pleasure instead of actual reality at the expense of so many billions of humans lives?

I think we have come to a point where this is actually possible. Maybe not in the next ten years. But I think it is something that can be worked towards. It would involve cooperation and genuine interest in providing our societies most brilliant minds with the propensity they need to achieve the greatest groundbreaking achievements possible in the shortest amount of time. 

Currently many limitations in science, medicine, and technology are set by financial limits. Why should this be the case? I think that our planet has enough resources and enough hard working and intelligent people that we could achieve a far greater version of life than the average person currently experiences. Imagine instead of having to choose between buying a new fancy car and a new fancy house if you were already content and happy with what you have and you were able to choose how you spend your free time with your friends and family? I think time is more valuable than the pursuit of consumer goods. We could provide much needed time and peace of mind to more people if our science and tech allowed us to. 

Why do we not have bright minds focused towards these pursuits by giving them the tools they need to do so? We put so much emphasis on working long hours to amass wealth to make the next expensive clothing or the next fast car or the next big television, but these things are empty temporary pleasures that have very little happiness value compared to a harmonious society where people rely on advanced possibilities, technologies/scientific & medical breakthroughs of the future which are no longer a dream because we have all contributed to making them real here and now instead of simply wishing. 

It would be possible for everyone to have everything they could dream of in an advanced virtual reality for example. Why do we need physical goods and waste and byproducts of waste as things and stuff just grow obsolete or damaged and constantly replaced by the next shiny things and stuff? 

This is a little bit of a rambling but it's an idea I had and thought I'd share it. Maybe I'm not able to make sense of this idea any better. Perhaps some of you can throw your ideas out there as well. Even if we are just dreaming, I think dreams are important and eventually become reality when people see incentive in them. A lot of talk of socialism seems to still revolve around profits and an archaic sense of monetary wealth. I just feel that our current technology has shown that this system is becoming obsolete and we should shift towards something better. I know rich people wont like this as much as poor people because they have a hand up on everyone, but what if that hand up is unnecessary and what if your happiness could increase along with everyone else's by owning and being part of an advanced civilization instead of sitting in the 21st century still arguing over 17th century ideologies?","2019-08-09 03:57:55","29336","3101","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/cnwzlz/society_should_shift_towards_a_technology_and/","True","Bjornskald","1747934262.415553","our planet is dying","manual"
"cl10xd","futurology","unknown","About that discussion on china's social credit system 5 months ago.","Im late to the discussion but i have some questions given i am also terrified of it too.

- What are the chances of this spreading to other countries and eventually enveloping the entire world.

- Will people with low scores effectively die of poverty, starvation, and thirst given they are restricted access to goods and services. because that seems to be the intent of that system. the dissenters die in their own home or die in the streets alone. 

- will living off the grid and hiding in the wilderness help one escape?

- will this social credit system bar me from committing suicide?

- is there any hope left in this world if this becomes global?

People are talking about how scary it is, how it looks like a black mirror episode/1984 and how dystopian and terrifying it is, but i wanna know if this will spread globally in the future and most importantly, within our lifetimes.and if this will snuff out any hope of freedom (except in death).

Because I am a Filipino American citizen trapped in the phillipines and I fear Duterte or his Protege implementing this after china implements it in 2020 as well as the us and other countries implementing it too.

Because I, a Freethinker, intellect and lover of freedom have no place in a social credit society and would prefer death over being turned into an organic machine on par with the proles or outer party from 1984. I fear next year and i fear the future. I'm not chinese but i still fear a future where every nation in the entire planet has gone full china and become as oppressive and as authoritarian and china where democracy and other western ideals have been snuffed out of living memory and freedom can only be attained in death and the whole of humanity is enslave. turned into mindless organic machines incapable of thought, incapable of emotion and programmed to do one thing: obey the party. obey the state.

"clqh2r","conspiracy","unknown","Purple Reign","Han [Purple](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ey8mmIgWRyg/maxresdefault.jpg) is a synthetic pigment that was created by the Chinese over 2,500 years ago. However, it wasn’t able to be recreated by modern chemists until the early 1990s. It is quite difficult to make. The pigment is a copper barium silicate and to get the elements to melt together, they have to be heated to about 850-1000 °C. It is said to be one of the most accurate shades of purple ever created.

Other purple pigments, made by both ancient and modern people, tend to be more on the red side. But despite all this, what makes Han Purple so special? Well, for one, it is capable of eliminating an entire dimension. How does this work you ask? Well, if you want to know the specifics, it’s best to hear it from the scientists themselves. I will provide a link below. It sounds confusing, but basically the electrons in the pigment only use 2 dimensions instead of 3.

https://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/june7/flat-060706.html

But what I find most fascinating about this dimension eliminating color is that it was found painted on the famous terracotta warriors. For those of you who don’t know, the terracotta warriors are a group of more than 8,000 statues depicting an ancient Chinese army. The statues were unearthed in the 1970s a mile away from the First Emperor’s burial mound at Mount Li. A MASSIVE mausoleum lies beneath this mound, one which no one has ever entered. The Chinese government says they don’t have the technology to enter it without harming it.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army

You have to wonder what the hells inside it though. Han dynasty historian Sima Qian claimed that 700,000 men worked on the necropolis, building entire cities and realistic landscapes for the emperor’s spirit to roam through in the afterlife. He also wrote: “Mercury was used to fashion the hundred rivers, the Yellow river and the Yangtze river, and the seas in such a way that they flowed.” Basically, a microcosm of China was built in the tomb, with flowing rivers of mercury, for the tyrant to rule over after death.

This may seem like a fantasy, but in the 1980s Chinese researchers found that the soil above the tomb contained curious mercury concentrations.

https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/flowing-rivers-of-mercury/8122.article

The First Emperor of China was obsessed with becoming immortal. He had sent people looking in far away places for the mythical elixir of life, but none ever returned. So, ordering people to build his perfect afterlife was the next best thing. But what does any of this have to do with the color purple? I believe this special pigment, the rivers of mercury, and alchemy are all linked.

We know that mercury can be compared to a bridge between worlds, or dimensions. Hermes, the god of mercury, was known as the messenger of the gods, speedily traveling between the heavens and the earth. Mercury is also associated with time, the fourth dimension. If you’re familiar with the supposed Nazi time machine Die Glocke, you’ll remember it worked by rapidly rotating cylinders filled with a violet colored substance known as red mercury.

We know that purple symbolizes wealth and luxury, mystery and magic, and most importantly, nobility and royalty. It has pretty much always been this way. In fact, during her rule, Queen Elizabeth I forbad anyone to wear it. Except close members of the royal family of course.

Now this is where things get a bit strange. Some people believe many members of the ruling class are a different race of beings. Ironically, the royal families have also been called blue bloods. You probably know where this is going, I’m talking about shape shifting aliens lmao.

http://i.imgur.com/aonI6Di.jpg

Many ancient cultures claim that their gods came from the stars and interbred with man to create a divine bloodline. Many of these ‘gods’ were said to resemble serpents.

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/77/bb/0077bb4b2c8ed10a1320dd9d0512ddb7.jpg

These beings cannot survive on our planet, so they supposedly genetically modified some human beings to create a sort of ‘middleman’ to do their job for them. Strange how our modern day civilizations still use ancient architectural symbols.

https://geraldsplace.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/10933804_815839691805670_3787123325631364460_n.jpg

Perhaps it is a combination of a dimension eliminating color, mercury, and ritual that allow these things to temporarily come down into this lower plane of existence.

”Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” — Arthur C. Clarke

Remember that Han Purple is a copper barium silicate. Curious how the well known shape shifter, the octopus, has blue blood due to its copper base. Ironically, some scientists theorize these creatures might actually be aliens.

https://nypost.com/2018/05/18/scientists-suggest-octopuses-might-actually-be-aliens/

It’s weird how chem trails are thought to contain barium and even sulfur, a chemical many claim to smell when they encounter demons. Are the alchemists terraforming our planet to better suit their ‘gods’ needs?

Another necessary ingredient to make a good chem trail is aluminum. This has ties to the transhumanist movement we’ve discussed before, but I wanted to touch on this because look what happens if you put Ba and Al (the names of these substances on the periodic table of elements) next to each other you get Baal, another name for Satan.

Once again, this all relates to Saturn. According to the Purple Dawn theory, the Earth used to orbit the brown dwarf star Saturn. Like we’ve discussed in previous threads, the solar system used to look much different. Because of the different kind of light a brown dwarf emits, it’s believed Earth was once immersed in a primordial purple haze.

http://www.everythingselectric.com/wp-content/uploads/saturn-theory-golden-age.jpg

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/80/62/59806202ad3bd353f05fefdf74da9f3e.jpg

Mainstream science has even come to some of the same conclusions. They call it the Purple Earth Hypothesis. Supposedly early lifeforms on Earth used to be retinal-based rather than chlorophyll-based, making Earth appear purple rather than green.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Earth_hypothesis

Basically purple represents something BEYOND and it is the color of the ‘gods’. Like I mentioned earlier, the octopus is thought to be one of these creatures from the beyond, and I personally believe an interdimensional octopus-like being might be running the whole show. Remember the shadow monster from Stranger Things?

If you’ve kept up with my Saturn threads you’ll remember the Demiurge, a flawed god who created this artificial construct we call reality. It is my personal belief that this flawed god is symbolically represented by the Kraken in literature and movies. Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst, believed that, in art, the ocean represented the subconscious mind.

“The sea is the favorite symbol for the unconscious, the mother of all that lives.” — Carl Jung

So what lies at the bottom of the deep dark depths of the unconscious? Fear. This fear for survival, a characteristic of the REPTILIAN brain, may be archetypally described as a massive multi-tentacled being who wants nothing more than to latch onto and consume EVERYTHING. This is the mindset of the collective today, so it is reflected in objective reality.

https://kropotkinoid.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/octopus.png

In The OA, Azrael, the Angel of Death, is a giant octopus that acts as a gatekeeper for the main character to see her true self. The octopus says she must give him permission to kill her in order to do so. I believe this represents letting go of fear in order to achieve enlightenment.

The Kraken is also a theme in the Little Mermaid. Ursula holds the trident, a symbol of the demonic god Shiva (the one in front of CERN who has affiliations with CERN), and Prince Eric is only able to defeat her once he grabs ahold of the helm of a ship, a Buddhist symbol for the path to enlightenment.

H. P. Lovecraft also wrote about Kraken-like entities whom he called the Great Old Ones. These beings were considered gods and came from dark far away corners of the universe. One of them in particular, Cthulhu, now resides at the bottom of the ocean, sleeping and waiting. He actually subtly influences people psychically to find him and awaken him. I mention this because this is how I feel about people looking to ‘summon’ AI.

Geordie Rose, founder of D Wave quantum computers, even said that his computers will ‘summon’ an AI similar to the Great Old Ones! I personally believe AI is an outward manifestation of the instant gratification the ego longs for. So in short, the kraken, the demiurge, artificial intelligence, and ego are all one. It’s only when we shut off the thinking mind, let go of fear and fall into the void that is the belly of the beast, we find the peaceful emptiness of enlightenment all the great sages spoke about.

In the movie At World’s End, Jack Sparrow greets the Kraken with courage. “Hello Beastie” he says, as he faces fear head on. He’s then dragged down to Davy Jones Locker, and its in this sandy empty wasteland beyond life and death that Jack learns to deal with his demons.

But is it really? I personally don’t believe so, because there is nothing natural about it. I will start off this thread by simply showing you the mathematical impossibility of a solar eclipse.

Few people stop to think about how much of a coincidence it is that the Moon perfectly blots out the Sun during an eclipse. This is only possible because the Moon is exactly 400 times smaller than the Sun, and the Sun is exactly 400 times further from the Earth than the Moon is.

This does not happen anywhere else in the known UNIVERSE. There really is no logical explanation for this. Its very improbable that this happened by chance, and it’s as if someone or something put it there. However, there are many more abnormalities.

The moon is far too big to be a ‘true’ moon. Its about one fourth the size of Earth, making it the biggest moon in relation to its planet in our solar system. Just look at it in comparison to other moons, then look at how big Earth is compared to Jupiter.

Some theorists think the earth was whacked by another planet and that the debris from the collision is what formed the moon. However, this theory is hard to compensate for after finding the moon’s surface to be seemingly more ancient than the Earth.

Another theory claims the moon was originally a rouge planet flying through space which was captured by Earth’s gravitational pull. But again, it’s too large for this to really work. So once more, the Moon seems as if it were placed there.

In fact, there really are no working theories. You would think the moon’s origins is something we would just know by now. Nope. But few actually talk about this. We just accept the moon’s existence without a question.

The moon also appears to be hollow. Between 1972 and 1977, seismometers installed on the moon by the Apollo missions were used to record moonquakes. When Apollo 12 deliberately crashed a module onto its surface, it was claimed that the Moon rang like a bell for about an hour.

https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-12-3.html

So what’s inside it? In 1970, two Russian scientists, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, proposed a hypothesis that the Moon is a spaceship created by highly advanced beings whom inhabit the interior. This theory was even published in a popular Soviet magazine.

There is also supposed evidence that there are alien bases and even entire cities on the surface of the moon. You can also find plenty of videos of UFOs landing on and taking off of it. Is this why we haven’t been back? Is this why the moon landings had to be faked?

But why can’t we always see these things? Perhaps there is fake moon hologram being projected on top of the real one. Back in 2014 conspiracy theorist and YouTuber Crrow777 accidentally caught something strange on tape. A wave on the moon, similar to static on a tv screen.

Here’s a link to the video:

The moon is so important. Not only does it tug on the ocean’s tides as well as our emotions (turning us into LUNA-tics), but without it, life as we know it could not exist. Its no wonder people used to worship the damn thing.

There’s actually some ancient cultures that reference a time when there was no moon. According to Zulu legend, our hollow moon was put in place by two brothers with scaly, fish-like skin.

The legend says Wowane and Mpanku brought the moon to Earth after stealing it from a great fire dragon. Only after emptying out the egg-like planet of its ‘yolk’ did they place it in Earth’s orbit. Curious how the ancient cosmic egg symbol has a serpent coiled around it.

And who was the great fire dragon? Planet X, or Nibiru, is a hypothetical 9th planet spoken of in ancient cultures as the gods’ home world. NASA has just begun to take it’s existence seriously. Supposedly it’s strange orbit causes it to go unseen for thousands of years. This planet has often been compared to the Red Dragon from the Book of Revelation. Perhaps aliens brought the moon with them from their home world.

So what is the moon then? Is it a giant observatory for the alien overlords? Remember, the fake moon is where the director watched over and controlled Jim Carrey’s life from in the movie The Truman Show.

This alien moon base is supposedly where we have our memories wiped before being forced to reincarnate again. This is according to several fringe conspiracy theorists. One of them being Max Spiers, who mysteriously died after puking black liquid.

Some say that after death, there is a ‘trick of the light’ you must not fall for. Going towards the light really takes you to an entrance into the moon, and like the DreamWorks logo suggests, this is where the ‘gods’ fish for souls. Everything we’ve heard about ‘going towards the light’ is programming, and it’s really a trap, similar to a moth being attracted to a flame.

In Asian folklore, there is a rabbit who lives on the Moon. He’s often portrayed as a companion of the Moon goddess Chang'e, constantly pounding the elixir of life for her with his mortar and pestle. The myth is believed to originate from a group of crater formations resembling the small animal and his medicine making tools.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit

The moon rabbit is present in many other cultures. Below is a depiction from the Mixtec culture. Its also associated with the Pooka, a trickster demon who resembles a tall white humanoid rabbit.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Púca

The pooka trickster demon, who is pretty much unheard of, is surprisingly very present in our modern day culture. Think of Trix cereal, the movie Donnie Darko, and even the newest Super Mario game which features a new group of antagonists, the Broodals. Villainous rabbits who live on the Dark Side of the Moon.

The pooka is also the Easter Bunny. Easter was originally the celebration of the fertility goddess Ishtar the Queen of Heaven. Her name is pronounced the same way as Easter and her symbols were rabbits and eggs. Eggs were dipped in blood as an offering to her. Sound familiar?

In a previous paragraph, I noted that the moon was compared to an egg in some ancient myths. This makes sense then why the two would be connected. In other myths, the moon was associated with the goddess Sin.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(mythology)

If you’ve been keeping up with my threads, you’ll remember sin is the sine wave, which is time. All of a sudden Alice in Wonderland’s White Rabbit and his obsession with time take on a whole new meaning.

Perhaps all of this is where the supposed link between a women’s menstruation cycle and the phases of the moon originated. And actually, the terms ‘menstruation’ and ‘menses’ come from Latin and Greek words meaning month (mensis) and moon (mene).

Earlier I mentioned that the moon rabbit was said to be constantly pounding the elixir of life with a mortar and pestle. The elixir of life was considered the ‘food of the gods’. Below is a picture of H. G. Well’s book of the same name. The symbolism here is curious.

Once again, if you’ve read all my work, you’ll remember that the ‘gods’ harvest our energy like food, or better yet, use us like batteries. Remember the energizer bunny who likes to pound away on his big white drum?

Check out this old painting depicting Buddha and the wheel of life. He’s pointing towards the moon which has a rabbit in it. Is he telling us this is where the secret to escaping the cycle of death and rebirth is found? And is that a tiny Saturn behind his head?

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a8/a2/5b/a8a25b7ac997ac587e0ffb7517167fdc.jpg

The movie Moon presents similar concepts. In the movie, a man discovers a secret vault on the moon full of clones who will be implanted with false memories and used for an agenda without their knowledge.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(film)

There’s also a show on Hulu called Into the Dark which features an episode named “Pooka!” It’s about a rabbit-like stuffed animal suit that causes a man to become violent and insane.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooka!

So what do you think? Is this all coincidence? Or are the connections beginning to be too much? I believe these symbols are put in movies, video games, and logos both deliberately and more often than you’d think, subconsciously. This is where the artist creates from.

When the artist manages to reach into his primordial mind, he finds profound truths he did not even know he knew. These things deeply resonate with us, hence why they become popular. The matrix code is in everything, even you, and it reveals itself to those who have eyes to see.","2019-08-03 16:40:27","167","102","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/clkspy/the_moon_soul_trap/","True","nickhintonn333","1747934536.568154","our planet is dying","manual"
