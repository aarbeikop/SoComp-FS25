I wrote this a few weeks ago on /r/self but I think here is more appropriate, and I feel like it's important for me to tell other people this.

Hi Reddit, 
I (20M) guess I'll start from the beginning, so as to get a clear picture of my life so far. 
When I graduated from high school in 2013, I had moved schools in my last year, mainly to get away from many people (mostly girls) and in hopes to make new friends. I did make friends, but ultimately got 'dropped' just before exams. So when 2014 had begun I started a traineeship at a local children's centre and had only a handful of friends from my old school. 

In just a few months of working there I was able to prove myself a very competent and 'on the ball' worker. And I'll admit, I was good at my job, I was really able to connect with the kids in a meaningful and genuine fashion. One of the women I worked with, Laura, was very friendly and nice to me. And I was always nice to her. She was 40, and had two kids of her own from two different men. After a few weeks of working together we became friends on Facebook and used to talk *every night*. All the time we used to just talk and she would usually talk about her boyfriend, and how he was lazy and was taking her nowhere. 

I was always supportive, I always listened. When Easter came around I went to the Royal Easter Show with my little cousin and bought myself some show bags which I gave to Laura to give to her kids. And one time I came across a vintage Polaroid camera and gave to her to give to her kids. She was really appreciative, and said it was worth something like $200. Anyway. I had gotten the feeling that her relationship with her faience of 7 years was coming to an end. One day in late June while we were packing up the children's beds I asked her if she wanted to see a movie with me. To my surprise she said yes. The next night she was free she picked me up and we went to this pretty fancy theatre some drive away. We saw the new planet of the apes movie. I wasn't really paying much attention - I couldn't get over how beautiful she looked. 

Another time shortly after there was a 'kindy disco' which we both went to, and we eventually told each other the only reason we went was to see each other. I got to meet her kids, Dylan (13) and Elle (9) and we got along well. She offered to drive me home that night to save me from catching the bus. When we were in my driveway I put my hand on hers on the gear shift and we both looked deeply in each other's eyes. She told me one time that it was one of the best feelings she had had in a very long time. 

Going forward now to late July and it was her birthday on the 22nd, and mine on the 27th. For her birthday I had gotten her an autographed picture of her favourite singer, Dave Grohl, I had bought it ages ago and it cost me a bit of money. She said it was one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone had ever given her. For my birthday she gave me a tall bottle of Vodka and a silver bottle opener with ""enjoy the ride"" inscribed into it - because we had a talk once about how being a teenager is just a ""ride"". 

For my birthday party I had a few of my fiends over. We had a BBQ and a fire and a couple of beers going. I was playing music with my iPad to a speaker and removed the lock on it so people could choose the music. Eventually, one of my friends had taken my iPad, had opened Facebook, and had started talking to Laura. They said ""I want to cum on your kids"". I was furious. I was so angry and upset that they would do this that I kicked all of them out. I had about 6 of them over and the party had only been going for about an hour. But I stood my ground, what would Laura think if I just let them stayed? So I told all of the, to leave. 

After desperately trying to talk to Laura, explain and apologise, she eventually said ""I don't like your friends"". 
This whole incident created a problem for me - we had all planned to go to the snow in just a few days. I had already paid my reservations. After taking to a few of them they all said how they were all sorry and that this shouldn't be the way and all that. Against my better judgment I accepted their apology and went with them. The whole car drive down I sat in the back seat by myself while my two closer friends sat up the front talking. I didn't say much the whole drive down but I had been drinking for a lot of the time. When we got down there, hired our gear, and checked into the room we were all having a pretty good time. But that night I had gone to bed early because I was pretty drunk. While I was laying in bed I was facing the shiny fibreglass wall. The others came in and I could make them out quite well in the reflection. They all started pelting me with pillows - especially the one I considered my closest friend. I just kept being still hoping they'd get bored, I skied the, just to stop a few times. Then they kind of did stop, but throughout the whole time my 'closest friend' kept saying ""aww don't do that - that's mean"" and so on. Even though he was doing it the most. 

The straw snapped, however, when it was all done but he did it just one more time really hard and then immediately said ""what a dick thing to do! Who did that! Oh my god!"" Even thought I saw him clear as day do it. I leapt out of bed and put him straight into a chokehold telling him *never* to do that ever again. This was probably a surprise to everyone - I always refrain from violence and hardly raise my voice like I did. He was pretty pissed off, he had a thing about being emasculated. We all just went to sleep. 
The next morning I called my dad calling in a favour if he could pick me up, from 7 hours away. He did the impossible and drove all the way to get me, then we spent a night in a hotel, them make out way back home the next day. I am always grateful to him for that. I've never spoken to those friends since. 

It was during this time that Laura had broken up with her boyfriend and this was kind of the signal that we could be together. That weekend, August 2nd, I met her, gave her a huge hug, and we both went out for lunch, got frozen yoghurt, them just walked and talked, sat in the sunshine, held hands, went back to her place, watched tv with my arm around her, then we eventually went to her bedroom and made love. It was the first time I had ever been with a woman. The next closest I had ever been was just a drunk kiss at a friend's party. 

I loved her, and I told her that, and I told her how beautiful I thought she was, she told me how she said yes to that date as a thank you got how good I had treated her. I spent the next few weeks staying with her more than I did in my own home. I used to do the dishes because her ex never did, I bought her her favourite flowers, gerberas, just for the hell of it, and I used to buy her her favourite tea for no particular reason as well. She told me once as we laid next to each other to never leave her and to never break her heart. I promised. 

Later that month we saw a football game together, even though knew I didn't like it, but I went and acted interested just because. We also went to the Dubbo Zoo, which was several hours away and we spent 2 nights in a hotel with both of her kids. We used to have dinner, see movies, go for walks. And I always tried to pay as often as I could because I thought that was the right thing to do, even though I earn far less than her. 
I even looked after her kids when she went to the gym in the morning - something she couldn't do easily before. Her ex didn't like spending time with her kids, and he didn't like her going to the gym. I never once said anything negative about the gym - I was always supportive. I used to make Elle breakfast for her, and I would always put up with her behaviour - she had Aspergers and hyperactivity and required a pill every morning. I put up with all the negatives, and never said a bad thing. Even though her apartment had cockroaches, even though she never cleaned it enough, and I cleaned it while she was out, her daughter was a bit of a pain in the neck but I never got angry or frustrated. I always cared about her and her children very dearly. 

I told her everything about me, about my hardships in school, about friends, family. And I listened to everything she told me. One weekend we did a fun run together in the city and spent a night in a fancy hotel and made love a lot and walked around the city just sharing stories and jokes. 

Then things began to change at work. 

Up until October I had more-or-less worked with Laura in the 2-3 year old room, but recently I had been moving all over the place for short periods of time before moving to the next room - I was now put in a 'floater' position. This was stressful, working with kids of wildly different age brackets and requirements and behaviours. And it didn't help coupled with the fact that Laura didn't want anyone at work to know about her relationship with me. At all. So I kept my mouth shut - and to this day I still haven't told a soul. 

Work was stressful - I eventually found myself spending most of my time in the preschooler room (4-6). I was covering for a woman with 6 years experience who couldn't handle the kids anymore. Even though I had only had 9 months of experience. They all thought I could do it because I was a guy. Legit. 

Working with a *very* difficult group of children, working hard on assignments, keeping my relationship a secret from everyone at work, trying to do my best to be a good boyfriend to my first girlfriend (at this point we were 19M and 41F), and spending a great deal of time looking after an 9 year old girl who could be completely unempathetic, downright selfish, could only wear particular kinds of clothes, and could be sporadically violent left me very stressed, and somewhat depressed. 

Because of my change in behaviour Laura stopped talking to me as much. She later would reveal to me that she felt like she couldn't talk to me because I'd take it the wrong way. For me, though, I was really feeling under appreciated by her. Maybe looking back I gave her too many looks of sadness... 
In early December I started seeing a therapist about my depression. I felt unsupported by Laura. 

I never knew if Laura ever wanted me to come over. I always packed an over night back just waiting for her to say I could come over. The usual excuses were that she was feeling sick, or she had her kids over and didn't want to deal with too much stress. 

At Christmas I gave her and her kids thoughtful presents. I tried to do my best. She got me a book, a shirt, a DVD, and a little nano block thing. For New Year's Eve she didn't want me over. She wanted to spend it with her son down by the beach and didn't want to be seen with my in case she bumped into coworkers or parents from the centre. 

In early January we went to the zoo together, I picked her up in my car, since I got my license in October I tried to drive her everywhere to repay her for driving me places. We had a good time at the Zoo. She thanked me for taking her out because she had been feeling depressed since Christmas - her ex boyfriend messaged her on Xmas eve saying how much his life sucks. She said he was trying to guilt trip her. Ever since they broke up they didn't speak much, and a few months later she said she never wanted to have anything to do with him again. I spent all of the xmas money I received on that trip to the zoo. 

In late January I was feeling quite a lot better; I felt confident in work, I had nearly done all my assignments, work wrapped up for me on the 5th of February, and I had so many plans for what I wanted to do once I finished work - do some traveling, build up a collection of resources for work, them return as a council casual at the children's centre. 

Laura and I saw a movie one time, the first time we had seen one in a while. When the movie finished I asked her if I could spend the night at hers, she flatly said ""do what you want"". She had been like this for a while. She never made it seem like she actually wanted me to come over. So, while I was following behind her car on the drive back, I turned left and went back to my place. Later she asked why I didn't go to her place. I just told her the truth. 

Eventually I all came out how she doesn't feel like she can talk to me because I've been so sad, and I told her that I've been feeling sad because she won't talk to me. Catch-22. I then said ""look, let's just put all of this behind us - we're in a perpetual loop that's making us both upset. Let's just have a date on Wednesday night and put all of this behind us""  she agreed. 

This was the last week of work for me. On Wednesday afternoon we were texting while at work - we were in different rooms. She said how she had a huge headache (sometimes she got them) and wanted to go straight to sleep when she got home. I asked her if I could just swing by and see her briefly. She said no. 
On Thursday night she had a parent - teacher type deal at the children's centre. Okay. I can understand that. 
Then on Friday night she said she was going to do yoga at the gym for the first time. Okay.... I'm not gong to stop her doing that...
Then Saturday came. Finally. I was finished with my traineeship. Finished with work. I finally had time to work on this relationship. I came over to her place with a back packed of clothes. She had just gotten back from the gym, Dylan was playing video games, Elle was doing some arts and craft. 

Laura and I were sitting on her bed. We were talking about how I could take a contiki tour or something because I was talking about traveling for a little bit. Then the talk kind of drifted into how I need to be meeting new people, and that she said ""you don't have any friends"" 
I said ""yes, I do""
""No, you don't""

Then she said that she thinks I need to find someone else. She needed time to herself. I picked up on what she was talking about. I started to swell up. I wanted to die. Instead of making scene in front of her and her kids I just left. She kind of knew. All she said was that ""I'm sorry"". 

I drove home. It was hard to see though the tears. 
That night we spoke a little. Kind of like nothing happened. 
The next day I tired to talk to her, to see if we could fix things. There wasn't much response. I said maybe I could see her on Monday. I didn't get an answer. 
On Monday I drove to her place, she wasn't home. I tried messaging her and she said she had to see the doctors (I'm pretty sure she was lying) I asked her what about and she said she didn't want to tell me. 

The next few weeks of February were tough. Some days I didn't message or call her at all, others I tried multiple times s day usually without much answer. One night in February I was supposed to meet a friend. I was catching the bus to where we were supposed to meet but halfway through the trip he said he couldn't make it. Instead of just getting off the bus and catching the next one home I stayed on it, it went right by her home. I knocked on her door, it was just her and her son. She let me in. Dylan was editing something on the computer, Laura and I sat on opposite ends of the lounge. We didn't really talk about our relationship. We just talked about other stuff. We shared some stories. It kind of felt like old times a bit. It was getting late - around 11. She offered to drive me home. I said that I'd catch a bus, I knew she didn't like leaving Dylan alone at home at night, and I didn't want to make her drag him along in the car. While waiting at the bus stop she said she probably would have called the police if Dylan wasn't there. 

After a few calls, a few pleas, she blocked me on Facebook. She blocked my phone number. She even blocked me on Pinterest. As a last ditch effort on the last day of February I went to her place to try and talk to her. She hardly let me speak. She just yelled at me. I ended up sliding that key chain bottle opener she gave my for my birthday under her door. She said if I ever try and contact her again she would call the police. 

I went about three months without seeing or hearing from her or messaging her at all. 

In very late April I saw her at the mall. Very briefly. Nothing more than eye contact.  I don't know why but I sat by her car - about 20 meters away facing out of the car park. I was mostly hoping she'd just stop by and talk to me. She didn't. A few days later I wrote her a letter, I included a few pictures of us together. I'm not too sure how the letter went exactly but I never put blame on her. I just said things like how I wish things were not like this. I delivered it. No response. 

A few days after that I was at the mall again hoping to buy something. I saw her with her family. I didn't want to approach them. I went outside the store and sat on a bench. Again facing away from where they'd be. Part of me was wanting them to pass, another part was hoping that they would talk to me. Elle used to hug me. She told me she loved me once. Laura used to tell me how Dylan looked up to me, how he really liked me, they both liked me more them her last boyfriend. 

They walked right past me. A few days after that I sent her an email. At that point, early May, I was kind of falling apart. Ever since she left me I became a recluse, I watched movies for days on end, rarely leaving the house, never speaking to anyone other than my parents. They didn't know what was going on. I just felt so worthless. How could someone that I've done so much for treat me like I'm the worst person in the world? I asked her, begged her, to tell me what she thought of me. If I meant anything all to her. Anything. 

She replied. 

She said that we *were* friends. But that's over now. It was all *my* fault. She said that I was in the wrong. We had just been friends. Friends? I was broken. I asked her to call me after she replied. She did. She basically said the same thing. She had no sympathy at all in her tone. Almost as if she didn't believe that I could be so sad and heartbroken. She said that I should just get over it - because she had. She'd gotten over it. In fact, she said she'd even found someone else. She hung up on me without a goodbye. I was devastated. I wanted to thro myself in front of bus right there and then. Even though deep down I didn't really believe she has a new boyfriend. I still don't really believe it. 

In late June I sent one more email. Just asking how she was. How her kids were. I missed her kids. I told her that. I gave a little update on me. I was trying to sound positive, not wanting to sound like I was guilt tripping her. I didn't get a reply. A few days later I sent another email ""maybe one day you'll realise how much you've really hurt me"". 

A few days later I got a call from a police officer. Laura had gone by and just asked them to call me. Apparently she told them I was stalking her at her place of work and her home. I told the man on the phone that was a lie. He seemed understanding. It was a lie. A complete lie. I never have been back to where I worked. I never went back to her place. I had only seen her twice since February. At the mall. I didn't even talk to her there. 

In late June I tried working as a casual in a few other centres.... I just can't do it anymore... I used to have such a passion for working with children. Now that dream inside of me is dead, just like everything else. 

Now it's August again. A lonely birthday.. No friends, no party. Nothing.. On the 2nd, a year after what was a magical weekend, I contemplated my own end very seriously. The only thing keeping me from doing it was a contract I signed with my therapist saying not to do anything until I could see my therapist next. 

Dylan's birthday is the 15th of this month. Elle's on the 29th. Now the next few months are going to be filled with anniversaries which will cause me nothing but unhappiness. I've started university. But I feel so apathetic to everything in my life now. 

The first weekend we spent together Laura had a finch on the verge of death she couldn't really look after much longer. I offered to look after it - my mum had a large avery of birds. The bird died the other day. I emailed Laura last Friday ""Sandy died today - I thought you should know"" no reply. 

I wish I could talk to her. Even just to ask how her day was. I have never felt more foolish, stupid, uses, manipulated, worthless, unimportant, in loved, and uncared for in all my life. I have never been more absolutely depressed and have never felt such heart ache and heart break in all my life. I was just a tool her her. Someone to use as a rebound from her last relationship. I made her feel good. I never said anything negative about her looks or anything. I loved her. I loved her with all my soul, heart, and being, I loved her children, I cared about her and her kids so very, very, deeply. And now I might as well be dead to her. Like I never even existed. I have never felt more emotionally used or betrayed. There are so very few things keeping me on this earth. There's no hope of ever being with her again, let alone talking with her like a normal human being. 

If you've made it this far then you truly deserve a medal. Thank you for reading this, even if you don't reply, it's enough that someone knows my side of the story. 

TL;DR - a naive teenager falls in love with a woman who broke him. A year of his life spent giving her all his love and trust, 6 months of a relationship, and she ultimately and suddenly dumps him, unable to see what she's done, refuses to acknowledge his existence, he may as well be dead to her. And that guy is me.

Updates since then:
Last Monday, the 17th of August, I wrote her another email. It was about 1.5 pages long, it was basically me telling her how hurt she has left me feeling, about all the things I did and tried to do for her to let her know that I wouldn't have been so generous if I didn't truly love or care about her and her family. It's probably no surprise that I still haven't gotten any sort of response. 

A few days after that I was able to email her first husband, the father of her son. I basically told him what had happened and how I felt really taken advantage of and taken for granted. He replied a few hours later sympathising and told me how I had described her to a T. He said that whenever she gets into conflicts or arguments with people she just shuts down and doesn't want to talk it through. He also said how it's something her parents recognise as well. 
It gave me a bit to think about. He said how he focused on his hobbies after breaking up with her. He was in a relationship with her for 12 years, married for 5. 

That weekend, on the 22nd, I contemplated suicide again. I tried calling her but I just go straight to voicemail since she blocked my phone number. I said how I can't do it much more, how I'm friendless, running out of money, completely alone. I laid in the grass for much that day. Thinking she'd call. I eventually just slunked back home, miserable. What if I actually had died that day? She wouldn't have even cared. 

It's still something that's plaguing my mind every day, and no day seems better than the last. I still feel like I'm going to die some day soon to my own hand. I just wish I could talk to her. About her day, about work, her kids, anything. Just anything. I don't know how someone can do this to a person they had such intimate moments with. I just remember all the dates we had and good times we shared and wonder how she can't remember them too and continue to treat me like I'm some sort of a monster. It's just so hard getting out of bed each day. I put on more than 15kg, I'm fat and disgusting. I feel like such a fool for ever believing anyone could actually love me. 

Anyway. Thank you for reading all of this if you actually did. I know this is incredibly long and I know if I came across a post like this I probably wouldn't have read it. I don't expect much in the way of comments, but I feel like it's important for me to express this stuff somehow.
