"876p6k","climate","scientific","Ive created a working revolution","To learn everything you need to know about our human condition as the 99% go on this Instagram account: Woke_revolution and join the taking back of our true freedom. 

Our government and corporate entities our enslaving the majority of our race and holding back our potential as a people to a great measure. Its not about working jobs, its about who we are working for. And i am telling you right now we are working for very corrupt and wealthy individuals, who only care for themselves and their interests, and not the people. If the government had been working for the people and our planet climate change and world hunger would be long gone out the window. But instead we are still enduring these crimes against humanity, and our potential. No government, and no elected leaders are on your side, and it is obvious. Just look at the current state of our world. Division, hatred, people being uneducated, wars, corporate and government corruption. And that just starts the list of whats wrong in our world. We have been fed lies and we are distracted every day to keep us unable to see through to how corrupt and twisted the world really is. The media isnt focusing on whats important. And the people are blind to this. Theyve just been 
taught to go to shool, get a job, work, have a family, consume, then just die. People dont know what we as a race are really capable accomplishing because because we have only had corrupt, non ambitious, unfaithful and uncaring leaders. All across the world. None of the leaders care for the people, and same as the governments. They only care to keep us trapped within this self destructive system which has been designed to destroy us. At this point that is whats happening. If fwe rise up as a people and take back our power and our lives. We can be free. We can know what it means to really be free. Until we destroy the governments hold on ourselves as a people, we wont know freedom. If we run the revolution we can solve famine and climate change in months. Yes. Together once we work with eachother and are united. We can work very fast. And accomplish great goals quite easily. Because we as a people are doing these things. Which has never happend before, it was always the sly governments and corrupt corporate heads that run the show and what and where the world goes. Liturally they benefited off keeping us down, oppressed, and enslaved. And did so very effectively cus this has been going on for years by badly selected leaders. So the people largely just have no idea. 

Our potential as a human species is undiscovered. Because we dont even know our own capabilities yet. This means once we come together and take our power back. Adding to or taking over the goverment. We can do so much good, we dont even know yet. Because we have the RIGHT! People in charge. As the revolution. We can stop all wars, have goals and specific interests that we as a race can accomplish and achieve together, stop famine in months, climate change likewise, poverty, and any suffering. We can stop all that, And do much more to build our race and earth. We are working for the enemy, the people trying to keep us working for them so they and few bastards gain greatly. We need to work for the revolution and take back/ change and transform the world for the fate of the human race!! 

We need to unite and break free, as a people, from the corporate and government grasp and do things ourselves. Or else our potential will be lost, and we will life in this horrible cycle of corrupted death.

"8272xv","vegan","unknown","Changing a mindset","Hi Everyone,
I wanted to get people's thoughts and stories on some questions I have, and also maybe get some discussion going.
My girlfriend and I just recently became Vegans and it has been an eye opening experience and exciting journey. The more we learn about all the benefits of being a vegan, the more we want our friends and family to also convert.
One of my questions is, have you ever successfully or even minimally converted someone, and how? I understand the normal excuses, ""it's two hard, can't afford it, doesn't taste good"" I mean people will literally come up with any excuse not to change. So was it through debate, education, force, never tried?
No one in my life was, or has ever been a vegan so I was never told to make a change. It wasn't long ago that we (girlfriend and I) ate meat, but I feel as though it was being educated that really got us to change our mindset and better ourselves.
How did you become a vegan?

For us, it started with ordering a ""TB12"" meal set. For those of you who don't know ""TB12"", it is Tom Brady's (American Football Player) side business. It's all about maintaining peak performance through diet and pliability. The set comes once a week with three meals, feeds two people per meal, and it is all plant based. Overall we love the recipes and since the food gets delivered it makes for an easy week of cooking. So we got a couple of those meal sets but never considered going completely plant based until we watched three documentaries on Netflix. The first was ""Food Choices"", the second was ""Fat, Sick, and nearly Dead"" and the third was ""Forks over Knives"". I know we have so much more to learn, but simply watching those three movies was enough for us. We emptied our fridge the next day, giving away any animal related items and buying some vegan cookbooks to get new ideas and recipes. We bought ""Thug Kitchen"", ""How Not to Die"", and ""The super easy Vegan slow cooker cookbook"". All of them are great, we are experiencing new flavors and meals we've never tried before, as well as becoming better chefs in the kitchen. 
So getting back to why I'm asking, I want my parents to eat better first off. We all know the health benefits of being vegan. And with them being above 60, some things are bound to start going wrong at some point. So last weekend we went to my parents house to spend a day with them. Cook them some vegan meals (to show how easy it is and how tasty they are), and watch one of the documentaries while answering any questions along the way. I would say it was pretty successful but not 100%. They were willing to listen to us and make some change, so they may get there one day. Others fight it tooth and nail though. I tried talking to my two brothers about this and they just ""Yes'd"" me to death so I know they didn't care to listen and they for sure won't change.
For me, being a vegan is a no brainer. Better for the planet, no killing animals, healthier me and gf (we've both lost 10-15 pounds already). However the other members of my family and friends don't see this, they know about the environmental impact, but do nothing. They know about the health impact, keep eating meat. It's like, how do you change a mindset that doesn't want to be changed?","2018-03-05 16:19:39","3","5","0.72","https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/8272xv/changing_a_mindset/","True","CoCleric","1747905226.7894132","our planet is dying","manual"
"88e0bp","vegan","unknown","I recently did a 2000 mile road trip, from Chicago to Los Angeles. Was gone for a whole week, and I wanted to share what I ate.","I'm not going to lie, there were a few Taco Bell and Subway lunches involved. My hotel breakfasts were pretty standard: fruit and/or potatoes, plain bagel or oatmeal with peanut butter, and a cup of tea, so I won't go over those. But I wasn't expecting to find vegan pizza in Lincoln, Nebraska. (Good job, Nebraska. Now I like you more than Iowa.) But Disneyland - WTF, Disney? For a place that claims to be the ""Happiest Place on Earth,"" you sure do insist on putting dead body parts in all your dishes. Yeesh! But anyways, I wanted to share with you all the places that I visited and food that I ate.

**Quick Backstory:** 

My brother's fiancé is a Disney fanatic and just got her dream job at Disneyland, so they had three weeks to pick up and move from Chicago to Anaheim. I love road trips, and I'm between jobs so I had the time. So I loaded up my playlist and drove out there with my brother, his fiancé, and her mother, all omni's.

**To Prepare for the Trip:** 

I take a [**daily multi vitamin**](https://www.amazon.com/Deva-Vegan-Vitamins-Multivitamin-Supplement/dp/B001GAOHVG/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1522442416&sr=8-2&keywords=deva+multivitamin) on a regular basis as well as a [**Vitamin D supplement**](https://www.amazon.com/Deva-Vegan-Vitamins-Vitamin-90-Count/dp/B005NZ636M/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1522442494&sr=8-2&keywords=deva+vitamin+d) (because apparently I can't stand out in the sun like a normal person) so I packed those with me. I also did a bit of shopping beforehand and bought some vegan breakfast bars and bananas. Seriously, there are so many vegan breakfast bars out there, so just grab whatever you'd like. I also packed my custom blend protein powder from [**TrueNutrition.com**](https://truenutrition.com) just in case anything partly resembling real vegan food wasn't an option. Also, because my Significant Other is the sweetest person on the planet and an amazing cook, he made a variety of vegan muffins for everyone to take on the trip. Otherwise, I relied on the [**Happy Cow app**](https://www.happycow.net) to show me where all the vegan-friendly restaurants were in each city, because I knew I wouldn't be able to rely on cooking for myself, and, y'know, FOOD TOURISM!

**Day 1**

Left Illinois first thing in the morning, drove through Iowa for a bit, stopped in Des Moines for lunch. We ate just plain ole Taco Bell. I had the 7-layer burrito with no cheese or sour cream, and I may or may not have added potatoes to those. Sometimes I do; sometimes I don't.

Finished the first day of driving in Lincoln, Nebraska. Happy Cow brought us to [**Mellow Mushroom,**](https://mellowmushroom.com) a casual build-your-own pizza bar on the University of Nebraska campus. I had a [**small pizza topped with an assortment of veggies and smoked tempeh.**](https://imgur.com/wuIurC3) It was pretty delicious!

By the way, it also looks like there's a [**Blue Sushi Sake Grill**](https://bluesushisakegrill.com) in the same area. I just tried that restaurant here in Chicagoland area, and I've got to say it's some of the best vegan sushi I've had in a long time. So make sure you try that too!

So good job, Nebraska. Now I have a reason to look forward to driving through your state again.

**Day 2**

Finished driving through Nebraska and stopped for lunch just as we crossed over into Colorado. Subway for lunch. I made a veggie sandwich with an assortment of veggies and guacamole. 

There was a cannabis shop next door, so we figured we'd do a bit of tourism and visit our first cannabis shop. They sold a variety of cannabis and cannabis-infused things like tea, lotion, lip balm, edibles, etc. A lot of it wasn't vegan, but they did sell hemp seeds. They taste like sunflower seeds and probably would have made a good snack, but I didn't buy anything.

Ended our day by stopping in Denver. This was my second time in Denver, and I have to thank r/vegan for giving me so many great recommendations the last time I was there. I fucking love Denver, and [**Watercourse Foods**](https://www.watercoursefoods.com) is my favorite restaurant ever. For those who have never been, Watercourse Foods is a casual all-vegan dine-in restaurant that serves the most amazing comfort food, and I've been completely blown away by everything that I tried there. Fortunately, my travel buddies were open-minded enough to go to Watercourse with me, and you guys... that restaurant nearly converted everyone.

I had the [**Street Tacos Platter,**](https://imgur.com/HWsuSZ4) which I thought was amazing, really great flavors all around and really impressive sour cream. My brother's fiancé had the [**Nachos with the tempeh chorizo and the cheese sauce which is to die for.**](https://imgur.com/fU2aneq) Her mom had the [**French Toast**](https://imgur.com/9u0Jzbh) (potato quality, sorry) and it looked like the best French Toast I had ever seen. And my brother had the [**Classic Seitan Burger with the Tofu Bacon.**](https://imgur.com/5mDuy0N) You guys... my brother is a pretty standard burger-and-fries kinda guy who used to be hesitant about trying vegan food, and he said this burger broke his top 5 burgers of all time! I was sure to get a bite of it and FUCK that's tasty! The only let-down about Watercourse Foods was that they ran out of ice cream, so we didn't get to try their milkshakes. But I have never eaten so hard in my life, and I waddled back to our hotel because I so full of delicious food. So thank you, Denver, and thank you r/vegan for that wonderful recommendation.

**Day 3**

Finally left the flat lands and did some gorgeous mountain driving. I'm completely serious when I say I want to leave Chicago and move to the Denver area. Some day...

Lunch was in Grand Junction, not too far from the Utah border. Had Subway again, same sandwich as last time. Nothing too exciting.

We stopped in Cedar City, UT for the night, and honestly, not much popped up on the Happy Cow. Fortunately, I had some leftovers from Watercourse that I ate for dinner at the hotel while everyone else ordered pizza. I've gotta say, Watercourse Foods is still good a day later. Utah is really pretty, but if I ever go back to visit, I might try Salt Lake City instead.

**Day 4**

Last day of driving, and lunch was in Las Vegas. As expected, Las Vegas has a ton of vegan restaurant options, and I'm sad that I didn't get to try more it because a lot of it looked really exciting. We ended up getting lunch at a casual chain called [**SkinnyFATS,**](https://www.skinnyfats.com) and I had the Mean Bean Burger (black bean burger) with rice, because their fries aren't vegan which I thought was kinda odd. Sorry, I don't have pictures of the food because it was honestly underwhelming. Again, I would have loved to stay in Vegas longer and eat some really good food, but we had to get back on the road.

Finally, we arrive at the new home in Anaheim, California, but since the place is small, we got a room at the Grand Californian Hotel on the Disney campus. And this is where it gets really disappointing. It was really hard to find vegan food at the hotel and on the campus without actually entering the park. The hotel itself had plenty of restaurants, but just about every item on every menu had animals products that couldn't be substituted. Same with the Downtown Disney restaurants. We ended up eating at the [**Rainforest Cafe**](http://www.rainforestcafe.com) where the only vegan option that wasn't a salad was the **Anaconda Pasta** (quinoa pasta with veggies) sans cheese. (Sorry, no pics of this one either.) The pasta was ok, but I thought, of all places, Disney would be have a variety of foods and be able to accommodate.

**Day 5**

Spent most of the day unloading the truck and getting everything unpacked. Lunch was Chipotle. Call me simple, but I do love a good vegan burrito bowl from Chipotle. Pretty sure I skipped dinner that night because Chipotle was pretty filling and I made use of my protein powder for the first time during the whole trip.

**Day 6**

Flying back to Chicago, but first, breakfast. I know I said I wouldn't talk about breakfast, but I have to show you this because it's the dumbest thing ever. [**This was my breakfast during my time at the Grand Californian.**](https://imgur.com/0IYrNM6) From their White Water Snacks Food Bar, these were their only vegan options and this breakfast cost me something like $8 or more. [Relevant...](https://i.redd.it/v5hsghqxo9901.jpg)

But wait... brother's MIL called the kitchens and asked if they could make a vegan anything, and they offered to make me a potato omelette with whatever veggies I wanted. Sweet! I had no idea you could do that. So I ordered a ridiculously expensive [**potato omelette with broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, and peppers.**](https://imgur.com/oUinCVS) It was honestly just a giant plate of potatoes cooked in different ways, but as someone who lives and dies by the potato, this was a-okay with me.

I got to LAX airport around lunch time, and I was hungry again. I had time to explore and eat, and I found an all-vegan organic place called [**Real Food Daily.**](http://www.realfood.com) As you can imagine, organic, all-vegan airport food in Los Angeles was expensive as hell, so I didn't eat too much. I just ordered a [**small bowl of marinaded tofu and seaweed,**](https://imgur.com/vPn6Fll) and it was... kinda sad. The tofu tasted like it was just marinaded in plain soy sauce with nothing else, and the vegetables were soaked in soy sauce too. Oh well. I'm happy to be home.

So that's it! That was my trip across the country. If you're hesitant to travel because you're worried about not being able to find something to eat, I can't speak for outside of the U.S., but you can find vegan food just about anywhere here.

**TL;DR:** I ate my way from Chicago to Los Angeles and shared my food adventures.

If I can ask that you look at the world around you right now, wherever you are. While you do that, just stop and think of your life. Please ignore the endless procession of fuckeries and injustice you’re aware is surely occurring to multiple someone’s, in various somewheres and elect only to focus on the more commendable aspects of humanity. The cool people you’ve met, times you’ve had, places you’ve seen, meals you’ve eaten, all underpinned by a collective ability to manifest abstract concepts into tangible actuality.

We’re a fucking bad ass species, no?

We wanted to live in colder places - we created clothes. We wanted to cross water - we created boats. We longingly observed the birds in the sky until we could take it no longer - we created planes. Satisfied for a while we marvelled in this new power- but still we longed for more. 
The moon had always been a stalwart companion of humanity, a bulwark against the terrors of the night and a marvel to behold to boot, yet it had always been a source of mystery and awe.. but still , *what if we could actually go there? [Wouldn’t that be something?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g25G1M4EXrQ)?*


All technology - spear to space shuttle- is the manifestation of this. More so than any other quality, our inherent ability to create - *to mentally visualise and then subsequently manifest in the physical form*, is and has always been humanity’s defining quality. We marvel when we observe animals displaying even infantile elements of this - but again even our [ability to **create** a “mind-space”](https://philosophyandpsychology.wordpress.com/2010/07/19/the-god-that-is-our-brain-bicameralism-and-theology/)  in which to  form this comparison, uniquely identifies us as different ([see Jaynes - Origins of Consciousness in the breakdown of the Bicameral Mind](http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf))

Along with love (*conscious desire*), it’s been the driving force behind our ascent to the stars - it’s quite literally the reason each of us exist: 

#Love + Creation = Humanity.


So we can argue against the dogma of mainstream science when it states that there is no rhyme or reason to creation, that we’re the mere manifestation of an unbroken series of fortuitous coincidences. That there exists no entity/force/originator possessing both the conscious desire (love) and ability (create) to initiate happenings on a universal scale. If you can be convinced that all that exists is the material, then through their control of the material - they can control you entirely. But if you can innately understand that **you** aren’t your hands, any more than **you** are your brain, then you’re only a small leap away from appreciating that *you are in fact something more than you have been led to believe*, then you can never be truly controlled. 

So I say we can argue with confidence, as our conscious awareness of our existence, coupled with an innate ability to love and create,  stand as  testament to this fact - *we are much more than we’ve been led to believe.*


A self improving, conscious organism that possesses sufficient intelligence to construct novel solutions to external stimuli, to the extent we’ve been able to mould an entire planet to a design of our likings, filled with creations of our making.

Short of the obvious (people born with severe cognitive handicaps etc), I truly believe with the appropriate guidance and resources, every single baby born on this planet, has the capacity to manifest into maturity as a highly capable individual, skilled in a variety of disciplines and fully able to contribute to humanity’s progression in all manner of ways. Look at how far we’ve advanced as a species with the more noteworthy contributions coming from a small minority, plucked from the pool of the economically advantaged. 
That’s not to say there’s not instances in recent times or recorded history of anomalies surfacing who bucked the trend. But for the most part, recorded history has told a tale of the wealthy becoming so through exploitation of the masses, so we can reliably infer that a greater number of that wealthy will become educated to the extent they can deliver contributions that advance our collective capabilities or/and understandings. 

With resources to thrive- nutrition, varied & engaging education, a stable family environment, access to healthcare etc kids grow to be capable adults. Even without that, kids grow to be capable adults. With that  - In our current system of global governance, the propensity towards systemic inequality is inevitable.



Depending on where you are in your journey, you’ll understand the reason things are like this is because a small group of very powerful banking and industry families, their lackeys and frontmen, have hijacked and now control for their own ends, institutions that should rightly be operating in the interest of all humanity. I imagine most here can take it a little further, and realise it goes further than just wanting to make money, and that these families and affiliated organisations & persons,  in some cases whole genetic lines ,belong to a millennia old cult devoted to the worship of  a Saturnian golden age.  

They understand that, in addition to sating the sexual depravities of these fiends, that [systemic elite pedophilia](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/?st=JEH8OGR3&sh=37d22646)  functions as part of Mystery Babylon’s blackmail network. It’s chief purpose  to ensure compliance & continued secrecy of their nefarious subterfuge of humanity, through the entrapment of  would-be participants in compromising situations ([see Roy Cohn](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6yRVhOCw3LY) & [Jeffrey Epstein](https://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/) 

The current cabal are just the latest manifestation of the usury driven, Babylonian system created by the priest schools that emerged after the fall- this is what The Tower of Babel refers to. The tower falling refers to the global collapse of the Ponzi scheme we know is inevitable in economies built on debt-based finance.

The popular misconception that the “myth” is a cautionary tale warning against overreach & arrogance is exactly that- yet another piece of disinformation foisted upon the masses to conceal the truth: that they’ve been here before, 


Matthew 7:16
>>You will know them by their fruits. 



[Ive found Troy D Mchlachans site Saturn Death Cult ](http://saturndeathcult.com/crimes-of-the-saturn-death-cult/the-tower-of-babel-myth/) a valued resource:

>>The people who joined in on the Babel project had a way of doing things, a system of operating and this was the real threat to the occupants of heaven (i.e. those in authority).  The reference to ‘speech’ in the 7th verse is from the Hebrew word ‘debar’ and it refers to the means of communication by which the ‘caphah’, or ‘way of doing things’, was co-ordinated.  Why would the writer repeat himself by using both ‘language’ and ‘speech’ in the first verse if he simply meant the spoken language of the people?

>>Babel, therefore, represented a ‘way of doing things’ that was different to those who traditionally held authority.  Because Babel is linguistically linked to Babylon, and because Babylon is symbolic of a counter-financial system in opposition to the biblical God, we can safely assume that Babel was primarily a financial system under the control of those who resided in its infamous ‘Tower’.  That tower, as we have seen, was the central temple and it has as its modern day equivalents, I believe, the various central banks of this modern era.

“They” (*members of various blood line families, mystery school adherents, their inductees etc*) are the custodians and operatives of a global system of control - that cycles through national currencies every few centuries, setting up central banks, operating fractional reserve confidence scams, hoovering up physical resources and labour with the resultant capital. It’s promissory notes are backed by nowt to be dispensed, circulated and returned with interest on the compound. Interest on the compound - a further fee on the debtor, presumably justified as a privilege for them receiving the loan. A model that’s resulted in the rampant inequality we see across the globe. 


Say you were to take a loan with interest, once you pay the compound, you’re working for the interest - ie your labour goes towards your creditor. Through no skill other than having the capital and authority to issue the loan to you. With no interest, any credit gained from labour enacted after the debt has been paid, is yours to keep. Providing you the surplus required to devote to other pursuits, learning new skills - growth. So when your country’s central bank issues it’s debt based currency, they’re quite literally manufacturing future promises to repay today’s debt - ie ensuring successive generations are born into bondage.



[The Hamilton Economic Program](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_economic_program) America was founded on is more akin to what we see in the bible:

>>Exodus 22:25 
King James Version 
25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.

Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 
Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken

>>Having no other asset than the product of their own labours from the land on which they lived, the colonists did the unthinkable. They started to issue their own money against that very asset, and they had the temerity to issue it debt free. It was a debt-free system of financing that was diametrically opposed to the debt-based financial model as practised by Mystery Babylon and enforced by the Bank of England –and to the horror of Britain’s banking elite it seemed to be working

The American system of finance was the catalyst behind the emergence of a nation with majority middle class, majority adult literacy and consequently , one that posed a  direct threat to the old world orders global system of debt slavery that the world labours under- [something had to be done.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_public_debt) 
Each  crisis provides an opportunity for debt to be leveraged . The correlation is evident. What isn’t so apparent is the hidden hands who engineer these conflicts for that very purpose.

As is obvious by now,[all wars are banker wars ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfEBupAeo4). If the banks didn’t want a nation to go to war - they wouldn’t finance it. It works the other way too- how often have we seen Banks instigate conflicts, then fund both sides. No matter who wins, the bank wins ..twice.



The bible is filled with historical accounts that correlate  with non-biblical sources. Flood myths, for example, are [prevalent amongst hundreds of ancient cultures ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flood_myths)  - clearly none of whom were practicing Christianity at the time. Now is the bible also filled with fallacy, wilfully inserted to maintain control through obfuscation & concealment? Of that there can be no doubt. But one thing you can also verify is Jesus was real. A bonafide living breathing person- his life was documented [in numerous sources outside of the New Testament ](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/did-jesus-exist/). I was raised Christian and found the church a weekly series of fallacious drudgery. Then I grew up and realised aha!it was a series of semi-true tales, spliced from and replicating other earlier religions, deployed by the moneyed elite as a control mechanism to keep the unruly serfs in order. Now? The [High Level Insider threads ](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6semd3/high_level_insider_mystery_schools_reddit_an/?st=JEH9VNXS&sh=93d4bd6b) and its focus on symbology offered an interpretation of biblical events that warranted  2nd reading, this time with a (extremely) rudimentary understanding of symbology & some context  (see below) in place. 

>>The appearance of Jesus 2000 years ago was not as a messiah but as a messenger (Islamic view of him as a prophet).
>>The jews are right that the first coming was not as a messiah, but wrong to reject him as a prophet because they do not understand that there were to be two separate missions (Christianity and Islam both get this right and anticipate the return).
>>Christianity is correct to emphasize the virginal birth and sacrifice. What the virgin birth means is that he rose to consciousness outside of the mystery schools, which laid bare the fraud of them concealing knowledge. His entire life was lived as a sacrifice spreading the truth to ensure that connection to higher consciousness / the godhead would never be the exclusive possession of the corrupted schools.
>>Christianity is, symbolically, the inversion of the old world order; the antithesis of the US regime. It is a first of its kind religion in this respect and of utmost significance to world history. You should know and be familiar with the Bible but it has been manipulated, pruned, incorrectly taught, and so on. We recommend [Thomas](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl_thomas.htm)  and [Mary](http://www.maryofmagdala.com/GMary_Text/gmary_text.html) , both of which were removed from the canon for being too straightforward for the old order's tolerance.


I’m nowhere near done with research, but  feel I’m at the stage where I  consider most of what I was taught to be bullshit. Now  I guess I’d say Old Testament reeks of Mystery Babylon - vengeful god, concealment of knowledge is necessary etc) I think it’s an encoded collection of historical accounts and prophecies centred around the life of a man who came upon the means to achieve elevated consciousness, - The Godhead- and rather than conceal it, he chose to share it with the world.


Terms like being “born again” and “the kingdom of heaven is inside you” are solemnly intoned by adherents to the faith - most never really questioning wether the interpretation they’ve received from the Church is in keeping with that intended by Jesus. The pedophilic practices of the Catholic Church are no secret. It should be evident that an organisation that enacts cover ups at the highest level of such abuse, is automatically disqualified as a credible compass towards an enlightened existence. 

Once you work through the bogus interpretations we were all fed as children  and view the biblical accounts of Jesus as a collection of allegories and symbology, the story of his life is amongst the most inspiring ever recorded. 

[Troward ](https://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-TheHiddenPower-ThomasTroward.pdf) makes the point better than I ever could:


>>He died because he maintained the Truth; that he was one with the Father. That was the substantive charge on which he was executed. ""Art thou the son of the Blessed?"" he was asked by the priestly tribunal; and the answer came clear and unequivocal, ""I am."" Then said the Council, ""He hath spoken blasphemy, what further need have we of witnesses?"" And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.


>>**And so we find throughout that Jesus nowhere makes any claim for himself which he does not also make for those who accept his teaching. **Does he say to the Jews, ""Ye are of this world; I am not of this world?"" Equally he says of his disciples, ""They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."" Does he say, ""I am the light of the world?"" Equally, he says, ""Ye are the light of the world."" Does he say, ""I and my Father are one?"" Equally he prays that they all might be one, even as we are one. Is he styled ""the Son of God?"" Then St. John writes, **""To them gave he power to become sons of God, even to as many as believe on his name;"" and by belief on the name we may surely understand belief in the principle of which the name is the verbal representation.**



>>**The essential unity of God and man is thus the one fact which permeates the whole teaching of Jesus.** He himself stood forth as its living expression. He appealed to his miracles as the proofs of it: ""it is the Father that doeth the works."" It formed the substance of his final discourse with his disciples in the night that he was betrayed. It is the Truth, to bear witness to which, he told Pilate, was the purpose of his life. In support of this Truth he died, and by the living power of this Truth he rose again. **The whole object of his mission was to teach men to realise their unity with God and the consequences that must necessarily follow from it; to draw them away from that notion of dualism which puts an impassable barrier between God and man, and thus renders any true conception of the Principle of Life impossible; and to draw them into the clear perception of the innermost nature of Life, as consisting in the inherent identity of each individual with that Infinite all-pervading Spirit of Life which he called ""the Father.**""


So you see the fundamental issue with the bible is the disinformation. The nuggets of truth interspersed with fallacy, the way allegory and literal meaning are interchanged to deceive and confound -the virgin birth for example.  A central tenet of Christianity. The teachings have been perverted to to deny us access to the truth. “Died for our sins”? What the fuck does that even mean? Didn’t he die because the Jewish church leaders  accused him of blasphemy? For claiming that he, and us all, are all children of God by definition - - not privilege? 
We’ve been taught that the miracle of a baby born to a virgin stands as testament to his divine origins. As you’ve read, this is a deliberate obfuscation of the intended meaning. When rational people hear shit like that, they tend to switch off. I know I did. I’m sorry but I just couldn’t reconcile anything I’d been taught, had sought or observed with the absurd notion of God having a child with a woman. Like Zeus turning into a bull or a pile of Gold. I mean come on. “Wouldn’t God be having a child with themselves as they made everything?” I asked. “God moves in mysterious ways” the Pastor replied. And that was that. 

How ironic that the condescending, illogical nature inherent in organised religion, turns so many away from the innate pivot towards questioning reality, that formed the demand  for its very existence.  And therein lies the crux of our tale: people are either turned away from the foolishness of it all, or embrace what they’ve seen, more or less. In either case they’re no nearer to what they sought than when they first started.

This is all by design.

If we realised and embraced the truth things would be very different. That we could all become a Jesus. Any of us. A personality of the ages, whose actions echo throughout history, inspiring others to assume the mantle of transcendent achievement. Like Krishna. Mohammed. Was that not the central tenet of his teachings?  That not only are we Gods children, we are Gods also. For how can the Kingdom of heaven exist within a person ... and that person not be a King themselves?

Admittedly the situation at present seems pretty bleak. The concealment of knowledge in all its forms -[scientific ](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18691-uk-keeps-three-times-as-many-patents-secret-as-the-us/) , [historical ](https://m.theepochtimes.com/uplift/piri-reis-map-evidence-of-a-very-advanced-prehistoric-civilization_1165572.html),[political ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sqxq03izxrQ) or otherwise- ensures a gap between the enlightened and the ignorant. Control of the institutions that dispense these truths results in control of those who use them to navigate their realities - ie all of us. But it’s heartening to see people question the official narrative more these days. Oh they’ll play it down on the media or wholly omit it altogether, but ask yourself why initiatives like social media censorship, net neutrality, CTR, need be enacted unless Mystery Babylon realised people were cottoning onto the reality things are very wrong, and have been for some time. 
But if you’ve only reached that realisation in the last election cycle for example, you’d be forgiven for thinking all conspiracies were centred around Pgate, Seth Rich, Rep/Dem etc 
It can be somewhat discouraging to witness the subs descent into a battleground of opposing political ideologies. One the other hand, everyone has to start somewhere:

 *Pgate* is a conversation away from someone in the thread who can link it to *Franklin Coverup* is a link from *Epstein & Cohns Pedophile black mail rings* is a link away from *CIA drug trafficking* is a click away from *OSS* is a link away  from *Opium wars* etc ... is a link away from




>> “So if all this other stuff is bogus, what do you think the truth is about Jesus?”




So far from seeing the influx of curious minds, the flat earth psyops etc  as a negative, it should be considered a positive sign of a changing times, when the corrupt institutions that previously held authority, are exposed as frauds. The consequent shift towards research and reason can only be a mass benefit long term to the collective consciousness- people navigating the world by what we learn, rather than what we’ve been told.

Collective awareness of the true nature of reality will be both our salvation and the catalyst to a future of continued advancement. 

       
Tl:Dr: Jesus was the original and ultimate  conspiracy theorist. His revolt against the moneyed elite laid the framework for the American Revolution. Mankind’s god given ability to advance through *our love of creation* as *creations of love*, has been subverted by Mystery Babylon for millennia. Growing awareness of this is moving us into an age of transition, itself occurring during the passing of the dollar as reserve currency, this taking place  as we move into the [Age of Aquarius ](http://earthsky.org/human-world/when-will-the-age-of-aquarius-begin) . Despite the strength of our adversaries, I choose to believe we emerge triumphant.


>>Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the **kingdom of God is inside you**
