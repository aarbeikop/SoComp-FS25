It is a brain state that evolved to solve immediate, tractable problems, like hiding from a predator, or suffering social disgrace in a tribe of 100 people. It has no utility in addressing climate change at all. Not a bit.

So meditate. A lot. Train your brain to be in a relaxed, calm, and prepared state. Calmness is not denial. Calmness is not acceptance, or defeatism. Calmness is calmness. It is the appropriate response to a multi-generational crisis.

The amount of pain coming is intense, and can be a problem even if your individual life is OK. Anxious people tend to be more empathic, and it is easy to have searing, gut wrenching compassion for people in Chennai who have run out of water, for example. Guilt, too, for your part in the global economy. 

But your compassion will kill you, and you will grieve yourself into an early grave. And in the end your psychological torment will count for little, and help no one. 

If we are going to get through this, it will not be through constant fretting and sleepless nights. If we survive, it will be by voting the right way, trying to spend the right way, and generally pushing the needle in the right direction.

I am 39. I never imagined as a teenager that we would have gay marriage or mainstream vegetarianism. Sushi was a bizarre food that I had never eaten. The internet was all dial-up. 

Back then I sure as hell didn't know anyone who took global warming seriously. And here we are. Everyone is talking about it, because we can finally see it. Things happen slowly at first, then suddenly.

And still my parents got big gas guzzling vehicles because they were more comfortable in them and I think also because they thought if climate change was really a threat then we'd be doing something about it. 

And then there was a time around the late 90s where even smart conscious people thought that maybe climate change wasn't really happening or it wasn't going to be that bad. 

I moved to Chicago in the early 00s and rode my bike/public transit, didn't have a car was a vegetarian etc... But somewhere around 2014 I gave up and I started to have that thought in the back of my consciousness that - if it was really this bad we'd be doing more. It was at that same time that I was graduating with a degree in chemical engineering and started working in the medical device field. Still supporting climate change action, but just not on my mind so much...

Then I decided to actually read the IPCC's Oct 2018 report and study it... Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!

2. You need a sense of contributing to the community.

In all seriousness, though, there’s no one “right” way to feel.

This is, emotionally speaking, completely unchartered territory. We may be aware of the five stages of grief, but, again, that was studied in terms of known situations; it wasn’t framed for the death and destruction of absolutely everything we hold dear.

Also as to a suggestion. I suggest getting the fuck out of dodge and making a life work somewhere that is less at risk of these changes.","2019-07-19 21:48:16","1","Sarcastic_kitty","1747931563.841312","our planet is dying","manual"

Allow me to explain. We have a lot of data on the collapse of major industrial societies because the Russians had theirs thirty years ago. They were actually ahead of us in that regard.

&#x200B;

During a social collapse, the most powerful strata of society, specifically middle aged, middle class (in the American sense of ""middle class"") white men, all lose their jobs, their savings, and their authority. With that goes sense of self and their sense of self worth. Life expectancy among this group plummets - they mainly drink themselves to death but also commit suicide in large numbers because they can't take the fall from grace. I've never had anything and I'm doing fine, me, but the social group known over here as the gammons, and to Americans as the Boomers get completely screwed. They get a taste of what they've been dishing out for decades without even knowing it.

&#x200B;

I can't say they don't have it coming. They had the same information available to them as we do, and they did nothing about it. The class of people with real social power toed the line and let the system completely screw the planet until there was nothing left. They knew they were doing it and they're not sorry. In fact as far as ""the system"" goes, they were instrumental in ensuring the elections of the disastrous Bush II and Trump presidencies alike - and the Tories and our own ongoing Brexit nightmare over here.","2019-07-18 21:36:04","7","[deleted]","1747931831.974157","our planet is dying","manual"

"etu5pu9","t3_cdi2xx","cdi2xx","Conservative","unknown","I think you might want to add some additional important distinctions:

-	In all of human history, there has never been a concentration camp where the prisoners have come voluntarily or have the right to leave and return to their original country. In every concentration camp, it was the host nation going out and rounding up prisoners to segregate them away from society.
-	Similarly, in every concentration camp in history, the objective of rounding up people and putting them in the camps was to keep them their indefinitely (or mass murder them) whereas in immigration detention, the detainees right to entry into the country is being adjudicated by an administrative law judge, and the objective is always to either let them into the country if they have a legitimate claim or send them home if they do not. There is no indefinite detention.
-	Also historical concentration camps targeted particular disfavored populations like the Jews, the Boers, etc. based on traits like religion, race, or ethnicity. Here immigration detention will detain you for crossing the border illegally irrespective of race, religion, ethnicity, or any other characteristic personal to the individual, detainment is strictly based on the individual’s actions—illegal immigration.
-	In every historical concentration camp the imprisoned population had no due process rights, no hearings, or bond, and no ability to leave by returning to their own country. In immigration detention, the detainees have all the rights afforded to them by the US Constitution and if those rights aren’t upheld they have immigration advocacy groups who will freely sue on their behalf to enforce those rights.","2019-07-15 15:34:59","88","Metafx","1747932400.191699","our planet is dying","manual"

If money is tight, can you show that a bean/rice/lentil based diet is cheaper overall, and show a meal plan that would still be appealing?

For one to bolster your theory of symbolism torwards the saturn cube, one can look to the nearly ancient universally accepted symbol of christianity it self - the cross - it is literally an unfolded cube.

For two ever since I've done this rituals I've felt a strong attraction towards Saturn, subconsciously have been becoming steadily obsessed, hell I had it as a display picture on my cellphone for months after my rituals. So it seems like my subconscious remembers my consciousness has forgotten.

For three whenever I did these rituals, time would literally freeze, things would stop, I wouldn't be able to go on the internet, or work my computer, because it wouldn't respond, it was left on before the ritual commenced and I wasn't able to turn it or the monitor off - all my clocks in the house were frozen at 12:00 for what seemed like hours. Yes I was alone when this was all happening, I could've been in an astral plane, or astrally projecting into this plane but since I was astral I was unable to actually interact with things.

They think the ""golden age"", is when we are in closest proximity to this star, right now we turned the corners of the outer orbits, and are on our way towards each other.

Through my studies also found that our 23.5  axial tilt of the earth is not natural and may have been purposeful to cause seasons of death.  Before this tilt created seasons our earth was much more static and peaceful and we were able to grow food all year long.  Kind of like a Biblical Eden, if you will.  

Negative beings may have hijacked our planet and turned it into a negative energy generation factory for them to feed on.  So maybe the Gnostics were on to something?","2019-07-17 15:19:36","3","epiphanyx99","1747932696.392373","our planet is dying","manual"

The reason Saturn is associated with time is quite simple and analog.

"eu1busv","t3_ce7vue","ce7vue","conspiracy","unknown","I don't have much to say on this, but this bit is completely wrong:

> The tesseract I mentioned earlier, which is portrayed in many movies, is a four dimensional cube, the fourth dimension being time.

The fourth dimension of a tesseract is a spatial one, not a temporal one. 

In our existence (3-space), we have three spatial dimensions, regarded as being at right angles to one another.

In a tesseract's world (4-space) there are four spatial dimensions, but they are *still* at right angles to one another.

I think what has happened here is that H.G. Wells' observation from *The Time Machine* (1895) has been garbled: 

> 'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.'

> 'There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. All real things—'

> 'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?'

> 'Don't follow you,' said Filby.

> 'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?'","2019-07-17 11:52:53","1","falsescorpion","1747932696.416033","our planet is dying","manual"

"eu1voml","t3_ce7vue","ce7vue","conspiracy","unknown","I think that most ""mystical"" or ""magical"" ideas are expressly created as a system of control.  Those ""in the know"" dangle these ""secrets"" as bait to keep them chasing ghosts.

Think about it this way... most political power in the ancient world was derived from claims of divinity.  There was always some secret just out of view.  The Masons, the mystery schools and most religion functioned to keep the plebs in line by always promising knowledge of the divine.

4chan used this type of thing to great effect in 2016.  The notion of Kek as an Egyptian God was considered a glib joke to insiders but those who believe in magic were actually quite scared by this.  The notion that some long forgotten God was somehow being invoked in a political war is the exact type of thing that these ""witches"" believe.

"eu3gtqa","t3_ce7vue","ce7vue","conspiracy","unknown","> The theory that we live in a binary star system has correlations with the Nazi’s belief in a Black Sun.

I strongly think our Sun is part of a binary or trinary system with Sirius A, both circling Sirius B -- Sirius A is the brilliant star (brightest in our night sky), Sirius B is a super-massive brown dwarf, invisible to the naked eye. This is what causes the Yuga Cycles (think of them as seasons of the 25,920 year Great Year), as evidenced by the precession of the equinoxes. I'm not sure where Saturn fits into this tbh.

Oh, and the Earth will eventually be a star -- as will all the planets. (Conversely, the Sun was once a planet and Earth was one of its moons.) We live on the cool, crusty surface a very young, growing star. It has a plasma core, then gas, liquid, then solid at the surface. Global warming is real and it cannot be stopped. The Earth will eventually be uninhabitable by humans.

I'm starting to suspect that if UFOs can displace liquids around them (there are reports of them flying right into the ocean without slowing), they can ""fly"" through the asthenosphere -- that is, through the magma under the Earth's crust. So, Hollow Earth but magma-filled and a plasma star in the middle where aether is transformed into matter. (I think CERN may be attempting to replicate this.)

If an earlier species from an earlier age developed advanced enough tech, they could live within there. And if you think about it: They would have an organic Dyson Sphere -- basically a type 2 civilization. We're just bugs running around on the surface.","2019-07-18 01:45:04","1","Aether-Ore","1747932696.435534","our planet is dying","manual"
