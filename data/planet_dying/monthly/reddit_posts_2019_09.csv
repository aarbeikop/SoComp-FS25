"d6yirr","climate","scientific","How to help solve climate change. the simple way (My simple thoughts)","I have been hearing so much about climate change. At least 8 to 10 times a day. Though what I mostly hear is ""help save the planet"", ""the planet is warming"", ""the bees are dying"". and for years I've been asking ""how can we really help?"". because every method I found online has been at worst a failure and at best barely does anything even if the whole world followed suit.

I kept thinking about the things we do to hurt the planet. And yes we all know it but I will try to list them (the ones I can remember) not in any order:

1- fossil fuel usage

2- farming (for our food or our cattle)

3- cutting forests for furniture and paper or to make space for farming

There must be more but they don't come to mind.

&#x200B;

SO to the main point of this article. How I think we can help reduce our footprint on the climate:

&#x200B;

***1-  Buy fewer clothes:*** *Fabrics either come from farming (cotton) or synthetic (Oil products), or hide (animals) and its literally the three points I made above. nowadays if you want to support your favourite vlogger you buy their ugly merch which is mostly just clothing. People have tons of clothes they wear a few times and throw to goodwill. We all want to be fashionable and can't let anyone see us wear the same thing twice. I have had people make fun of me for wearing the same shirt 3 times in a month (I don't care of course) but it shows you what kind of society we live in. I can keep talking about this but you get the point.*

***2- Stop wasting food:*** *The USDA (* United States Department of Agriculture ) estimates wasted food at **30 - 40%**  of all food produced, which is estimated at **$161 BILLION** DOLLARS per year. My mouth dropped at that number. Straight away my grandma's voice came to mind ""pour what you can eat, and finish your damn plate"". We all see the trendy videos of huge portions of food and gigantic burgers and pizzas. and amazing looking cakes. Viral videos of people eating monster-sized bowls of ramen,  every friend I have sharing ""food is my weakness"" 5 minutes after crying about climate change. 

Let's eat what we need. Let us stop being slaves to tasty food. It's hard but the climate is more important, right? RIGHT?

**3- start using Hemp products:**  so I can't say I am sure about this. but I have seen studies about help benefits to the climate and to the reduction of forest cutting. and they seem very promising. I won't talk about it here. you can do your own research.

**4- don't boast about expensive things:** can we stop showing off with materialistic things? and if you really want to show off. Use your good heart. Or physical fitness or strength (Yes I am talking to you rappers. and celebrities). These actions make people want more things that they don't need and it won't make them happy. 

I was very proud of my Xbox controller that I fixed myself so I don't need to buy one. And the chandelier I made out of empty wine bottles. No I am not near perfect but I try to be good as much as my evil self let me.

I know things are becoming cheaper and easy to get. But let's put more care into them. The more we care about our things the less we need to fix or change them (thats one reason I don't like Apple. they rather sell more things than let people fix their stuff).

**5- Donate into education:** people like to donate to the less fortunate. And honestly, I think the best place to donate is in educating the Uneducated, whether it's in your own country or another poor country. Nothing is worse than an uneducated human. (like that one ad says ""Stop giving African kids shoes"").

Education helps all of us RISE UP, and allows people to push themselves and those around them into success.

&#x200B;

Alright, I think I've said enough. although I can go on ranting forever :p.  

PS. this is my first post on Reddit. I hope it brings in civil discussions. I also didn't proofread it (sorry too lazy).","2019-09-20 17:50:48","2","4","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/d6yirr/how_to_help_solve_climate_change_the_simple_way/","True","JustMJay","1747934773.918575","our planet is dying","manual"
"d3xy4p","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","My sister is the reason my uncle committed suicide and my parents are completely blind to how she has torn our family in two","Let me be clear in saying that what follows is by no means an exaggeration of any kind. My sister is arguably the most evil person I have ever physically met. You may think that it's common for each person to have someone that they truly detest in life. It could be a particularly nasty past school bully or perhaps even the current serving president of the United States, Donald Trump.

My sister on the other hand is worse than any bully or shitty president. She's quite literally a complete and utter homewrecker. There really is no amount of space which would suffice to list each of her crimes and certainly not even my native command of English would probably serve to adequately convey the damage and pain that she has caused each other member of my family both individually and as a group. Let alone anyone else she has come into contact with...

If,

* cheating on her boyfriend with a rapist (after physically and emotionally abusing her bf for years), or
* dating only broken and easily manipulable men literally old enough to be her father, or
* having a 3 year long relationship with a married man who was at the time, literally being begged (publicly too, on his Facebook wall) by his actual wife to stop cheating on her and to stop having sex with another woman, or
* abusing and slut-shaming her mother for years despite having a long history of even more egregious behaviour,
* systematically (and consistently for over 10 years) destroying any chance her bother has of a relationship with both his parents, or
* threatening to keep a pregnancy purely out of spite, or
* not even cutting down on smoking during said pregnancy (and being a hypocrite by abusing friends years later for doing the same thing), or
* physically assaulting every single member of her family multiple times, or
* working to try and have her sibling removed from his fair half share of a will and inheritance, or
* telling all of her female friends that she will humiliate and slut-shame any of them if they date or even show an interest in her brother, or
* do everything humanly possible to make her sibling feel unwelcome in the house that he grew up in over 18 years, or
* read through the personal messages of her friends and family behind their back in an attempt to gather dirt on them to use for manipulation and the construction of lies

doesn't sound bad to you. Then the only answer is that *you* must be my sister.

My sister is guilty of each and every single one of the things I listed above. God only knows what else she is guilty of as those are only the ones that I know about by association of sadly sharing the same mother. I'm sure the worst of her crimes are things I am not even aware of. The point is that despite having done all of those things, not only can she still somehow sleep at night but she has never once made an effort to repent! I don't mean to God either, I mean by no means has she ever once issued an apology to fucking anyone.

At one point I had resigned myself to the understanding that my sister is beyond help, and that I hoped at least the damage she had done to people could somehow be repaired with time. I figured even she had a limit to her selfish behaviour and that most people were hopefully smart enough to realise quickly what a piece of work she is and stay away. So only it's really her family who can't escape.

Well any shred of pity or hope I had just fucking ended when my grandmother called me to let me know that my uncle had committed suicide. She also told me that before he died, he sent out a long message on fucking Facebook and left a short note stating that among some of the things he was ashamed of in his life, having sex with his niece (my sister) was ""it"" for him.

My uncle who had a whole host of issues and who has been suffering from depression for over a decade, killed himself after having sex with my sister.

The worst part is neither my mother, nor my dad, my uncle's brother... doesn't believe the situation. My uncle's widow who spoke to my dead uncle about what happened in private said she discussed the situation when he confessed to it a few days ago. She (the widow) also contacted my sister privately who admitted to it and said that it would never happen again, and it was just a 'one off' thing. Instead of making things worse my uncle's widow kept everything to herself in the hopes she and my uncle could work through it, so only 3 people knew what happened (my sister, my uncle and her widow).

My sister is now repaying that mercy and kindness by denying the whole thing ever happened now that my uncle is dead and cannot say anything about it, placing it all on my uncle's widow as some kind of sick fucked up story she invented to try and find someone to blame for my uncle's suicide. I can't even begin to describe how furious I am.

I also cannot even fathom how both my parents believe my sister. She has literally ripped our family in two. My parents won't even speak to me because I don't side with my sister against my dead uncle's widow who has been left with nothing but accusations of being a liar on top of everything else that's happened. There's a huge list of things my sister has done that my parents know about, there's literally a clear pattern here. But they refuse to believe it. 

My parents had a great relationship with my uncle and her widow. It wasn't perfect but it was one of the better connections our family had. I'm now worried that my uncle's widow is going to do something rash and my sister will probably wind up with 2 people's blood on her hands. My mind is absolutely reeling right now. I feel like she's not even human.

Part of me wants to abuse the crap out of my parents. We've all seen the Facebook message he sent to some people, it's been shared around. My parents don't think that he wrote it. Even the note that they've seen, they don't think he wrote it. It's his freaking handwriting!

I've been living for over a decade hoping that one day my sister would just repent. Just stop being such a cunt. Not even wind up doing something good for the planet, but just stop hurting people. Now I just wish she was the one who committed suicide. This is the last straw for me but I'm holding out some kind of hope that this is just the first stage of denial and that someday soon my parents will wake up out of this web of lies my sister has created.

*To be clear btw, I'm disgusted as hell in my uncle also and I'm not really making excuses for him except it was clear to EVERYONE that he was depressed as shit and my sister has a penchant for trying to sleep with much older guys. I definitely think that my sister manipulated him, I don't know why he also did it but no one can ask now anyway.*","2019-09-14 00:10:59","191","46","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/d3xy4p/my_sister_is_the_reason_my_uncle_committed/","True","081248235875689102","1747935588.2003179","our planet is dying","manual"

[Read Part I first if you haven't already](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cvdw60/wanna_go_down_an_interdimensional_rabbit_hole/)

[INTRODUCTION:](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4c3lg/wanna_go_down_an_interdimensional_rabbit_hole/)

**The ultimate goal of this project was to obtain a better understanding specifically of the spiritual/metaphysical aspects of the pedophilia which is so inexplicably rampant amongst the highest echelon's of every society in the world.  In the last post we explored the idea of this secret ancient occult knowledge and how it has been passed down amongst the rich and powerful in secrecy since the beginning of civilization. We found out in Part I that this ""secret ancient occult knowledge"" is actually just a Hermetic view of the world that is basically an understanding that the spiritual/metaphysical aspects of reality are not only real, but far more important than the simple material experience which we live everyday. It is no mistake that the term ""occult"" (which literally means secret or hidden) has been so heavily weaponized especially in the US, it is immediately associated with pseudo-scientific lunacy by almost everyone mainly thanks to Hollywood. This is what originally motivated me to begin this project, the mainstream's overt insistency that anything spiritual or metaphysical is to be laughed at was becoming a bit too obvious for me. This, paired with the obvious spiritual obsessions ie (symbolism, rituals etc) of the most powerful people in the world was really bothering me and inspired me to make these posts.**

**SECTION I:** That which is apparent to our five senses is only a fraction of the human experience

.

* ***Before we uncover the ancient roots of this malevolent immaterial force we have to solidify the fact that there is truly a metaphysical aspect to this reality. This is my expanded research on my claims in Part I.***

First we must do a recap on the ancient origins of esoteric and spiritual knowledge. In Part I, we showed that an extremely diluted form of Gnosticism (a strictly metaphysical belief system) influenced each and every one of the mainstream religions practiced today. But what I failed to mention in the last post was the fact that Gnosticism was specifically derived from the Hermetic school of thought which gained popularity in ancient Egypt and is said to have originated far before the earliest of our known history. Hermeticism is said to be passed down from the ancients of the “lost land” and has been regarded as the oldest form of knowledge even amongst the ancient Egyptians who taught it and popularized it. The Hermetic Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions;  this knowledge has been very carefully disseminated amongst the elites of various secret societies for generations upon generations. I recommend reading the first chapter of the Kybalion if you want a full picture of its origins.

\-**So why should we take Hermeticism seriously?**

Here I will show that these unimaginably-ancient Hermetic Principles are constantly being proven in modern science through quantum mechanics

**--Mentalism:** The first Hermetic principle tells us that *“All is mind, the universe is mental.”*

This is now being explained by breakthroughs in quantum gravity, the field devoted to uniting Einstein’s relativity with quantum theory, as due to quantum information processing, which tells us that our spacetime is [an emergent simulation](https://www.academia.edu/456203/Simulating_Space_and_Time). Elsewhere, experiments into the foundations of quantum mechanics, such as tests of the [Leggett inequality,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leggett_inequality) have actually falsified material realism.  Recent discoveries tell us that spacetime emerges specifically from entangled information, the i[nformation generating quantum entanglement](https://www.nature.com/news/the-quantum-source-of-space-time-1.18797), the phenomenon wherein two or more particles affect each other at vast distances at speeds faster than light (Previously regarded as impossible by the Laws of Physics) .

Meanwhile the[Integrated Information Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03633-1_14) of consciousness, or IIT, identifies entangled information as integrated information or consciousness:

*”Quantum entanglement and integrated information, to the extent that one cannot perturb two elements independently,* ***they are informationally one***”

**Putting these two together we see therefore that spacetime emerges from consciousness.**[The universe is after all a mental information construct](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03633-1_14) **inside of some greater consciousness, which is of course the same thing as the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**--Vibration**: The next Hermetic principle ill cover, the Principle of Vibration tells us that: “Nothing rests; Everything moves; Everything vibrates.”

Modern physics exactly parallels this with the wavefunction. According to the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics, everything can be defined by a wavefunction that describes a quantum probability wave, which vibrates at a specific frequency.

\--Interestingly, the parallels do not stop there. Other direct parallels specific to both quantum mechanics, as well as even more advanced physics exist. *The Kybalion* states that:

*“if the vibrations be continually increased the object would mount up the successive states of manifestation… until it would finally re-enter The All,”*

**As it turns out, the frequency of an object’s wavefunction is directly proportional to the energy content of the object being described. So the higher the vibration of the object the greater the degree of its mass or energy content, just as described in the quote.**

A discovery regarding the relationship between space and quantum entanglement demonstrated that spacetime behaves as a holistic pattern of entanglement known as a string-net, and that subatomic particles emerge from this string-net. This network of entanglements is of course a field of vibrating quantum waves.

String theory meanwhile tells us something similar. According to string theory matter and space are actually two descriptions of the same thing. This is shown by the fact that spacetime created by matter due to relativity shares the same vibratory frequency as the matter that generated it. The spacetime is merely matter at a different degree of vibration and vice-versa, exactly as explained in the quote.

* ***I will stop these draining and complex examples here but this can be done with almost every one of the main Hermetic principles (check for yourself). How is this possible? How can the most ancient human ideas be explaining quantum theories we are just finding out today? In the next part I will show how the most complicated scientific theories in history have struggled with this problem.***

**--Continuing with Modern scientists struggles with the relation between ancient knowledge and modern quantum theories we have learned in the last century**

&#x200B;

**Werner Heisenberg**:

Quote from [Tao of Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Physics-Exploration-Parallels-Mysticism/dp/1590308352)

“I had several discussions with Heisenberg. I lived in England then \[circa 1972\], and I visited him several times in Munich and showed him the whole manuscript chapter by chapter. He was very interested and very open, and **he told me something that I think is not known publicly because he never published it. He said that he was well aware of these parallels. While he was working on quantum theory he went to India to lecture and was a guest of** **Tagore**\*\*. He talked a lot with Tagore about Indian philosophy. Heisenberg told me that these talks had helped him a lot with his work in physics, because they showed him that all these new ideas in quantum physics were in fact not all that crazy. He realized there was, in fact, a whole culture that subscribed to very similar ideas. Heisenberg said that this was a great help for him.\*\* **Niels Bohr** **had a similar experience when he went to China.”**

# 

**Erwin Schrödinger**:

“Nirvana is a state of pure blissful knowledge… It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two ‘I”s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents — their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further… when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.

**“In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records, to my** **knowledge**\*\*, date back some 2500 years or more... the recognition\*\* [**ATMAN**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Atman) **=** [**BRAHMAN**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brahman) **(the personal** **self** **equals the omnipresent,** [**all-comprehending eternal self**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_All)**) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world.**

&#x200B;

**Niels Bohr:**

“For a parallel regarding to the lesson regarding the limited applicability of such customary idealizations, w**e must in fact turn to quite other branches of science, such as psychology, or even to that kind of epistemological problems with which already thinkers like Buddha and Lao Tse have been confronted, when trying to harmonize our position as spectators and actors in the great drama of existence**.”

**“** In the psychophysical parallelism, as envisaged by Leibniz and Spinoza, has obtained a wider scope through the development o**f atomic physics, which forces us to an attitude towards the problem of explanation recalling ancient wisdom, that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and spectators.**

**Bohr adopted the yin yang symbol as part of his family coat of arms when he was knighted in 1947.**

**Wolfganf Pauli**\*: He viewed that the acquisition of knowledge in mathematics or quantum physics “gives rise, however, to a situation transcending natural science” that can even acquire a “religious function” in human experience. This is not a belief in the religions of old, but as Pauli states “I do not believe in the possible future of mysticism in the old form.\* ***However, I do believe that the natural sciences will out of themselves bring forth a counter pole in their adherents, which connects to the old mystic elements.”***

**Alber Einstein**: This \[the theories connecting ancient mysticism with modern quantum mechanics\] led to Einstein’s famous attempt at “breaking” quantum physics, the [EPR paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox). At first a thought experiment which appeared to demonstrate quantum physics violating the seemingly well established principle of [locality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality), later experiments showed that quantum physics instead proved locality to be false, therefore collapsing the laws of physics.

Violations of locality and determinism seemed to bother Einstein greatly, and this can be seen in his famous quote objecting to the randomness involved in wave function collapse under Bohr’s interpretation, that “God does not play dice”.

Einstein wrote in his autobiography:

*“All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this new type of knowledge (quantum mechanics) have failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built.”*

**Keynote**: I am by no means claiming that these scientists have “cracked the code” of ancient mysticism or have indefinitely solidified a scientifically proven connection between these ancient ideologies and modern physics. I am not even saying that these scientists fully believed the point im trying to prove her at all.  But let's just assume for a second that what I am arguing is true, these ancient Hermetic texts have divine origins and are a correct philosophical interpretation of the intertwined physical and metaphysical reality of the universe. If this was the case wouldn't it be safe to predict that the most intelligent minds, attempting to understand the laws of the universe, in modern history would be in a constant intellectual struggle with these ideas throughout their career? Well, know we know that they have been.

**Now let’s look at the physicists behind the CIA and KGB during the Cold War**:

\-- Because of the Cold War, accounts of alleged psychic abilities (extrasensory perception, as in telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, a.k.a. telekinesis, and psychometry) could no longer be ignored by the US and USSR intelligence agencies out of fear of losing a competitive edge. Experiments and tests on people with these abilities were abundant at this time,  thankfully coming along with an overwhelming amount of scientific literature trying to figure out how the hell this was even possible. It soon became obvious that well.. it wasn’t, well at least not within our current laws of physics, we obviously needed to reevaluate our current understanding of physics just like Einstein in that quote. This called for scientists to start taking the theories of quantum mechanics seriously. Quantum mechanics ended up being the first field of study which could offer natural explanations for these phenomena.

\--The significant results of the findings in the document [ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF GATEWAY PROCESS,](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) showed that **the only way to naturally explain this kind of paranormal/esoteric phenomena, scientists view the universe through the Holographic Universe Theory.**

***We know from the last post that there is as much evidence behind the holographic universe theory as*** [there is behind the current big bang theory,](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170130083231.htm) ***I elaborated on this in Part 1.***

\--There becomes a point where, both physicists and us a society, have to be either all in on this holographic theory of the universe or just discredit it altogether. There simply is no other way to explain the paranormal phenomena which people around the world are conducting. The problem with going “all in” with this theory is that it tears down everything that we know, again just like we saw Einstein stressing in his quote.

This is best exemplified in [a CIA document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82-00039R000100230012-3.pdf) showing a Soviet Scientist, tasked with constructing a quantum theory of reality. He states:

*“The repeated attempt to construct a quantum theory of field..* ***that would not be purley illusory and in which it would not be necessary to physically absurd consequences***\*, have not been met with success”\*

Read [The Paraphysics Warsaw Pact](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100020010-5.pdf) to see how real paranormal abilities are

&#x200B;

**SECTION II:** What exactly am I looking for?

&#x200B;

* ***Now that I have laid out my expanded argument for the reality of the metaphysical/spiritual nature of the universe, It is time to tie back in to the ultimate goal of this project.***

To tie back into Part I, we must understand that all of those in power have a complete and total understanding of the Hermetic spiritual nature of the universe which they have actively and purposely hidden from the masses over generations. Those in power have used this spiritual/metaphysical knowledge to their advantage in order to maintain ultimate and total dominance over the world and its inhabitants.

**So where does the evil that embodies these elite tie in?**:

Going back to Robert Bernard; [here he explains](https://youtu.be/VA3BDYpkDbo?t=2818) how spirituality came into play during his time as a top player in this international crime syndicate:

“Then you start to discover that there is much more than what I call the 4 dimensions, you have length, width, height, and time… but then you start to discover that we are the cross point of multi-dimensions and frequencies.. You start to sense that there is really something going on in the other frequencies and dimensions and then **you start also to know that there are low frequency beings, what we call now the fallen angels or the Djinn, who are really serving a sort of master… a dark manifestation entity known as Lucifer… We really have to face the fact that besides the 4 dimensions we have this interaction with other intellects, other beings.. And the ones I was serving (negative manifestation Lucifer) was real- it was not a joke, including the sacrifice of children everything was real.**

**I also came across a reference to these evil entities in the book** [*The Vatican Exposed*](https://archive.org/details/vaticanexposed00paul/page/6)

*“The scoundrels we study remain even to this day some of the most accomplished* ***matter deceivers*** *in western history. The fraud and masquerade we encounter in these pages is not only a product of a particular conspiracy or cabal it is older than the pyramids and of institutional character.* ***They are two-faced operators, for whom double-thinking and double-dealing are second nature..to an immensity greater than we can imagine. We are in the presence of the servants of an intelligence almost without limit; and second only to God”***

&#x200B;

**Once again an immaterial evil force was mentioned by the Vatican’s top exorcist** [Father Gabriel Amorth:](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Print/2010/03/11/vatican_exorcist/)

According to The Times, Amorth blames ""cardinals who do not believe in Jesus, **and bishops who are linked to the Demon"".**

Father Gabriele Amorth, who according to The Times is president of honour of the Association of Exorcists, said the Vatican's current problems - including **recurrent child abuse allegations and a brewing gay prostitution scandal - can be largely attributed to Lucifer's visitation at the Vatican.**

&#x200B;

**Main Point:** What the fuck are all these different sources talking about? I was so goddamn lost at this point in my research but at the same time absolutely positive(my opinion) that these consistent allusions to this immaterial force, couldn't just all be bullshit, there is an active evil presence playing out malevolent events in our world to serve a higher spiritual being and I was not going to stop until I found out what it was.

&#x200B;

**Section III**: The ancient descriptions of this immaterial force

&#x200B;

* ***My search for information regarding these malevolent beings started with the ancient accounts of these forces in various ancient cultures. Here is what I came up with:***

Like with most of this project I will start with the most ancient description I can find which, again, is the Gnostics, this is how they describe these malevolent spiritual forces which they call Archons:

**Archons:**

\-They are ***cyborgs*** inhabiting the planetary system (exclusive of the earth, sun and moon), which is \*\*described as a virtual world (\*\**stereoma*) they construct by imitating the geometric forms emanated from the *Pleroma*, the realm of the Generators, the Cosmic Gods.

\-Archons are said to feel **intense envy toward humanity** because we possess the intentionality they lack

\-Have no empathy, **feed off of negative emotions, have no creative ability**

\-Archons are an alien force that **intrudes subliminally upon the human mind and deviates our intelligence** away from its proper and sane applications.

\-Archons are ***psycho-spiritual parasites***\*\*.\*\*

\-The risk they pose by invading our mental software is far greater than any physical risk they might pose by erratically breaching the biosphere.

\-Because the **Archons need human complicity to gain power** **over humankind, any one who assists them can be considered a kind of Archon, an accessory.**

\-Working through **telepathy and suggestion**, the Archons attempt to **deviate us from our proper course of evolution.** Their most successful technique is to use religious ideology to insinuate their way of thinking and, in effect, substitute their mind-set for ours.

**Keynote**: to quickly summarize here, an Archon is a **parasitic,** **cyborg, alien/foreign intruder.** They are **envious** of certain human traits, attach to hosts, and have **telepathic** powers at their dispense. Really think about the meaning of these ideas, especially the bold terms, before moving on to the next section.

&#x200B;

* ***Now we are going to take a look at various ancient religions from different time periods and cultures and read their descriptions of this immaterial evil force. Keep your eyes out for the similarities!***

\--**Quran-Djinn**(specifically referenced by Ronald Bernard): Djinn are capable of possessing human beings. They are said to enter the bloodstream and circulate rapidly through the body. They cause mental and physical problems, and also disrupt marriages and relationships. Asking a Djinn to leave, or bargaining with it, may not be enough to get it to go, and someone who is trained may be needed to perform an exorcism to get it out of the body.

According to Islamic writings, Djinn live alongside other creatures but form a world other than that of mankind. Though they see us they cannot be seen. Characteristics they share with human beings are intellect and freedom to choose between right and wrong and between good and bad, but according to the Qur'an their origin is different from that of man

\-- ***Mesopotamian Toltec-The Allies***: . The Allies lack a brain, **which means they have no factory to create emotions**, but they need the **ethereal energy of emotions to sustain their life. Allies push humans to create traumas in order to create fear, which they feed upon.”**

The Allies must then **convert emotion into the negative emotion on which they feed**. He explained that the Allies had no mechanism to produce the negative emotional energy themselves. They had to turn human emotional energy into negative energy before they could harvest it. In order to turn human emotion negative, the Allies are **capable of putting fearful thoughts into the minds of humans which in turn generates the negative emotion on which they feed.** *These entities are attracted to negative emotional energy much as sharks are to blood.*

&#x200B;

***--Wetiko-Native Americans***:  Wetiko is an Algonquin word for a **cannibalistic spirit that is driven by greed, excess, and selfish consumption** (in Ojibwa it is *windigo, wintiko* in Powhatan). It deludes its host into **believing that cannibalizing the life-force of others (others in the broad sense, including animals and other forms of life) is a logical and morally upright way to live**.

*-Wetiko* **short-circuits the individual’s ability to see itself** as an enmeshed and interdependent part of a balanced environment and **raises the self-serving ego to supremacy.** It is this false separation of self from nature that makes this cannibalism, rather than simple murder.

*-Wetiko* can **describe both the infection and the body infected;** a person can be infected by *wetiko* or, in cases where the infection is very advanced, can personify the disease: ‘*a wetiko*.’ This holds true for cultures and systems; all can be described as being *wetiko* if they routinely manifest these traits.

***--Chitauri - Ancient African:*** \-The **Chitauri** are an evil extraterrestrial race of shape-shifting humanoids

\- We are told the **Chitauri feed on the energy that we give them**. They **make us fight against each other, and when the whole world is drowning in death, fear, and terror,** the Chitauri get f**ed by the dark power which is brought out when humans destroy the planet on which they live**. **They are fed when human minds think at certain levels. We are told they want us to think at certain levels and they reward us with long lives.**

\-**-E’epa-Hawai**i: The e'epa are mental forces that have the ability to **intrude into the human mind.** They operate through subterfuge and psychic stealth.

T**hey are adversaries who are drawn to humans because they wish to acquire our human capacity for creative imagination**. Humans are creators, and they are not. Because of this, the deceivers will always be thwarted by the superiority of our human species.""

***--Bible-Demons:*** *Demons have the* ***ability to possess people***\*. These fallen angels are what the Bible refers to as demons.\* ***Demons are able to take shape, form and be visible to humans*** *(Job 4:15). Demons may be exercised, or driven out, from a possessed person. However, this may be dangerous if not followed by stringent cleaning and discipleship. Without proper spiritual care, the person might then be open for a seven-fold infestation (Matthew 12:45).*

***Demons confuse the truth by utilizing demonic lies and half-truths*** *(1 John 4:4).Those who* ***worship idols and pagan gods are really worshipping and sacrificing to demons.*** *D****emons live to deceive people into worshipping themselves*** *(1 Corinthians 10:20-21). The Bible teaches that demons can inhabit animals and people (Matthew 8:31)*

\--**Zuswazi Africa-Zulu**:

And, it is further said that these Zuswazi, these Imbulu, or whatever you choose to call them, are not capable of eating solid food. T**hey either eat human blood, or they eat that power, the energy that is generated when human beings, on the surface of the Earth, are fighting and killing each other in large numbers.**

**Main point**: How is it possible that all of these cultures from all over the world from entirely different time periods are describing the same force with the same characteristics? There has got to be some reality to this, something more than simply primitive fairytale like we are taught. So I researched…

&#x200B;

**Section IV**: Modern Descriptions of this evil inter-dimensional force

* \---By this point I knew I was on to something, I used these descriptions to search for other accounts of these forces. The first similar and reliable I came across was the work of gifted Austrian Philosopher [Rudolph Steiner(1861-1925)](https://exonews.org/rudolf-steiner-describes-the-hostile-spiritual-beings-who-feed-off-of-your-fear-and-anxiety/)who was a stand philosopher and academic of his time. Steiner states:

“ *There are beings in the spiritual realms for* ***whom anxiety and fear emanating from human beings offer welcome food. When humans have no anxiety and fear, then these creatures starve.****” declared Steiner. “****These beings are hostile towards humanity …and they become more and more powerful (from this negative human energy nutrition) …launching cruel attacks on human beings.****”*

*“Therefore,” says Steiner, “it is above all necessary… that the person who enters the spiritual world overcomes fear, feelings of helplessness, despair and anxiety.* ***These are exactly the feelings that belong to contemporary culture and materialism because it estranges people from the spiritual world… to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown in people,*** *thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.***”**

&#x200B;

This wasn't enough for me, I needed some scientific backing, after seaching long and hard I came across [this psychology study in the CIA FOIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000700760002-6.pdf)vault by clinical psychologist Juilka Kiskos and Andree Samuel

&#x200B;

**The Abstract Reads**:

*“Clinical Psychology has not taken into account evidence provided by other areas of research that point to the* ***existence of other levels of reality.*** *Therefore, that which is not perceived  through physical senses is often considered as being of a paranormal nature.* ***The authors have observed that in some psychological disorders sometimes there is an ESP factor mingled with the symptoms, and which are only taken into account as a proof of  ""insanity***"".

\-The entire study is dedicated to drawing a distinction between what doctors deem as “insanity” from actual clairvoyance experiences. The specific type of “insanity” we are going to cover for our purpose is the schizophrenia/”voices in your head” part of the study. These psychologists would employ “sensitives” or people with ESP to try and interact with these “voices” in some way. They turned out to be extremely successful and seemingly were performing ground breaking science that, unsurprisingly, we never heard about...

**Here are some direct quotes from the study**:

“*During the treatment of certain patients,* ***we came across extraneous personalities***\*. These were named “Theta Agents” because the circumstances in which they manifest themselves led us to conclude they were deceased persons.”\*

*“As a working hypothesis,* ***we consider that these entities exist in another level of reality or structure of their personality***\*, enabling us to understand and(page cuts off)”

**-There are 4 different groups of Theta Agents that they categorized. Only one of them matched up to the description consistently allotted to us by these ancient cultures previously mentioned.**

Category 3: “**Theta Agents induced to harm patients by means of black magic”**

[https://i.redd.it/g7zekqa6tmm31.png](https://i.redd.it/g7zekqa6tmm31.png)

***Now we are starting to get somewhere, The next place I looked for evidence turned out to be the more obvious one, with a lot more first hand accounts and expert testimonies… demonic possessions, which I previously believed were fiction.***

\-What many religions have called “demon/djinn/e’epa/etc. possessions” actually turns out to be a very similar if not identical condition as the malevolent “theta agent” described above.

**There is undoubtedly a demand for the services of Exorcists which has been legitimized by the Vatican**:

“In 1990, Father Amorth and five other officially appointed exorcists founded the International Association of Exorcists.By 2010, the organization numbered around 300 members from around the world, and although it was founded as an informal organization, the **Roman Catholic Church officially approved its statute in 2014**.”

\--**Father Gabriel Amorth did an** [exclusive interview on this topic](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/interview-with-an-exorcist--the-devil-and-father-amorth-69777) **which he required to be released only after he died, here are the highlights**:

**Q**: Can you contact these entities, what do they say?

**A**: ""Yes, through the patient, but in a strange, unnatural voice. If it is the Devil himself, he says 'I am Satan, or Lucifer, or Beelzebub. We ask if he is alone or if there are others with him. We ask when and how they entered that particular body. **We find out whether their presence is due to a spell and the specifics of that spell.**

**Q:** How do people come to be possessed by demons in the first place?

**A:** ""I believe God sometimes singles out certain souls for a special test of spiritual endurance, **but more often people lay themselves open to possession by dabbling with black magic. Some are entrapped by a satanic cult. Others are the victims of a curse.""**

\--If you do not want to take the word of someone with religious presuppositions and biases I completely understand, neither did I. So here are the highlights from a [Washington Post interview with Richard Gallagher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/), a board-certified psychiatrist and a professor of clinical psychiatry at New York Medical College (studied psychology at Princeton, Yale, and Columbia) Here is what he had to say:

&#x200B;

""*As a man of reason, I’ve had to rationalize the seemingly irrational. Questions about how a scientifically trained physician can believe “such outdated and unscientific nonsense,” as I’ve been asked, have a simple answer*\*\*\*. I honestly weigh the evidence. I have been told simplistically that levitation defies the laws of gravity, and, well, of course it does! We are not dealing here with purely material reality, but with the spiritual realm. One cannot force these creatures to undergo lab studies or submit to scientific manipulation; they will also hardly allow themselves to be easily recorded by video equipment, as skeptics sometimes demand. *(The official Catholic Catechism* [*holds*](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm) *t****hat demons are sentient and possess their own wills***\*; as\* ***they are fallen angels, they are also craftier than humans. That’s how they sow confusion and seed doubt, after all.****)""*

""*But I believe I’ve seen the real thing. Assaults upon individuals are classified either as “demonic possessions” or as the slightly more common but less intense attacks usually called “oppressions.”* ***A possessed individual may suddenly, in a type of trance, voice statements of astonishing venom and contempt for religion, while understanding and speaking various foreign languages previously unknown to them. The subject might also exhibit enormous strength or even the extraordinarily rare phenomenon of levitation***\*. (I have not witnessed a levitation myself, but half a dozen people I work with vow that they’ve seen it in the course of their exorcisms.)\* ***He or she might demonstrate “hidden knowledge” of all sorts of things*** *— like how a stranger’s loved ones died, what secret sins she has committed, even where people are at a given moment. These are skills that cannot be explained except by special psychic or preternatural ability.*“

&#x200B;

* **While these expert accounts are extremely significant in their entirety, In order to keep this project moving forward in the direction I wanted, I focused on a specific aspect of these pieces of evidence: dark magic, spells, and devil worship.**

\---These mentions of dark occult practices seemed to be exactly the connection I was looking for to explain the evil nature of this international-mafia. They purposely create wars, disease, child killings/raping, because these are the greatest sources of the dark and negative emotions/energy that they feed off of. I will list the mentions of dark magic and occults below from the previous three sources:

&#x200B;

**CIA Psychology study**: “Theta Agents induced to harm patients by **means of black magic”**

**Father Gabriel Amorth:** “ people lay themselves open to possession by dabbling with **black magic**. Some are entrapped by a **satanic cult**. Others are the **victims of a curse**.""

**Richard Gallaghe**r: “In the late 1980s, I was introduced to a self-styled **Satanic high priestess**.. In our many discussions, she acknowledged worshipping Satan as her “queen.” **She could tell some people their secret weaknesses, such as undue pride. She knew how individuals she’d never known had died, including my mother and her fatal case of ovarian cancer. Six people later vouched to me that, during her exorcisms, they heard her speaking multiple languages, including Latin, completely unfamiliar to her outside of her trances.**

**Keynote**: The simple yet significant conclusion that can be drawn from these excerpts is the fact that these malevolent spiritual entities are not entirely random and out of control, **there exists people and groups with the spiritual capabilities/knowledge to wield these negative forces for personal gain.**

* ***What other motivation could there be for all of this unnecessary suffering created by these people? Like of course you could say 9/11 and military conflicts were created for the financial and power gains, you could say that the globally organized and universally protected sex trafficking of children is just because these people simply enjoy the thrill of abusing and molesting children, or the suppression of  world changing technology( e.g.Tesla free-energy) and cures for diseases is to prop up a future of their continual reign over the earth, etc. but thats not a good enough explanation for me at this point.  There are plenty of other ways for these people to go about their business while continue to control the world but there is a direct link between the agenda of these people and maximum suffering and pain. What else can explain these people’s obsession with symbolism and ritualistic behavior? What else can explain the Luciferian churches and celebrations that Ronald Bernard alluded to and I talked about in part I?***

\--Take this quote from life-long clairvoyant [Anton Steiger](https://www.antonstyger.ch/index.php/en/about-myself) an outspoken advocate for the metaphysical realm and esoteric nature of our existence:

*“When I see people in business or politics who are particularly trapped by the material world, for example, I notice that they no longer have any light bodies at all. In many of these people, the point of light at the heart chakra, which is otherwise always present, is no longer visible to me. Instead, I see something like a layer of ‘shiny tar’ around them in which a monstrous being in the shape of a lizard can be distinguished. When such people speak on television, for example, I see a crocodile shape manifesting itself around the person like in a concave mirror; I don’t see the light of their throat and forehead chakra.”*

&#x200B;

There is something different about these people, something inhuman, something immaterial. It’s time to wake up and realize that the material world is just a fraction of what we are meant to experience as humans. These elite fully understand this but use/hide this knowledge to serve the dark manifestations of spirituality through material control over every aspect of this world

If your ideas can't stand up to the slightest bit of scrutiny without you flying off the rails then there is something wrong with the messenger.

Go outside, smoke a bowl since it's legal in Canada, and step away from conspiracies for a bit. I'm sure >>Ottawa<< is beautiful this time of year.

[–]trancemixt[S] 1 point 14 minutes ago 

Oh look at you trying to scare me. What a brave little man.

Do my ideas scare you, little one?

WITNESS the disinformation agent call out my city in an attempt to scare me.

WITNESS their disgusting and vile nature.

Hey Fred buddy, no. Thank.. YOU!!

UPDATE 2: I am not one to complain but yo... the Reddit Vote Manipulation is REAL.  Frustrating too.

NOTE: I used to be very wary of the ""Ra"" channelings but now that I have found the people approaching it scientifically with good morals and nothing but good intentions, we see the result.  TRUTH is the result.  Amazing.

how about starting with clearing up how human history really went (re: extra terrestrials in our history).

Why don't we ask them directly?

To start, what was Egypt all about? 

Answer:

https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?c=People&su=Akhenaten#Akhenaten

This book is mindblowing: https://www.llresearch.org/library/the_law_of_one_pdf/the_law_of_one_book_1.pdf

RECOMMENDED: To browse and click on many names at the top of the above link and read, Jesus, Muhammad, even Hitler and Eisenhower.  Fascinating.

wingmakers.us (real)

wingmakers.com (truth mixed with lies, the site was taken over and replaced, thank God for Fred Burk SAVING the entire site and copying it over to wingmakers.us or I would not be here typing this.)

When you see how the interviews were changed, and WHAT was changed, you can see the CLEAR coverrup (damage control).  They knew the bulk of it was out of the hat so they decided to change the interviews by DELETING huge sections and replacing with LIES.  By changing names and even distances to Star Systems.  Weird, no?

NOTE: all over the web, youtube, everywhere, you will have assholes (agents and fucking morons) talking about ""Dr.Neruda"" and interview 3, 4 or 5. These interviews were NEVER RELEASED and the ones on youtube are quite obviously FULL. OF. LIES. it pushes new age horseshit and lies about some ""Grand Portal"". The original interviews below SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. No New Age garbage. Zero mention of Grand Portal or Ascending to higher dimensions, that is all new age garbage.

WINGMAKERS IS THE REAL DEAL.

Interview One: WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews1changes.pdf

Interview Two: WantToKnow.info/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews2changes.pdf

note: when the name was changed to ""Dr. Neruda"" it was the CIA taking control, these 2 pdf's are what remains of this truth disclosure from around 1999-2000 and then 2001 happened and the WingMakers was buried.

Now we have someone running Wingmakers.com who is NOT the original poster. They have changed everything on the sight (CENSORED) and literally turned it into wholesale (everything used to be ofc free).

They've commercialized an alien contact episode to hide it.

Here's where it gets really messed up:

In the original interviews someone named ""Mahu Nahi"" is mentioned one single time. He is said to be the leader of the ""Corteum"" (AKA annunaki) which is supposed to be an alien race that the US government has made a treaty with (think Eisenhower in the 1950's). I believe the Corteum is disinformation and he was instead referring to the Draco (reptilians).

So now we have someone named ""James Mahu"" who mysteriously took over the site wingmakers.com and wiped the original content from the web.

If you search for his instagram, he calls himself ""James Mahu - Mahu Nahi"". According to the legit interviews, and if it is true, James Mahu aka mahunahi is quite literally the leader of the ""corteum"" aka Draco. ROFL.

He claims he ""updated the website"" as per the emails exchanges he had with Fred Burk that Fred published on his website.  But it is all a lie as Fred shows us; they CHANGED everything, added in Theosophy and New Age Luciferian trash to it, added as a goal to ""ascend"" to higher states and all this HORSESHIT. What used to be there, is truly amazing.

How amazing? So amazing that this info still stands all by itself, just like Phil Schneider and Fritz Springmeier.  Some very special people.

Been researching for like 20 hours straight and am unable to prove WingMakers as being a hoax - this is REAL - and is the biggest coverrup going. The one with the BIGGEST implications. Don't believe me? Try to prove me wrong, I dare you.

When Phil Schneider was killed in the 1990's there was 130 confirmed deep underground military bases in the USA alone and 1400+ worldwide.

So many of these bases exist now? If they are so fucking huge, what the  is going on down in those bases?

When Qanon made references to the matrix and people being fed on or whatever I am convinced this is the DUMB's and the fact they have made alien contact long ago and have done an agreement with the Draco to literally farm humans and feed them to Draco.

(SIDENOTE: we also know like ancient places in mexico and whatnot used to worship serpent gods and do sacrifices to them, clearly just more annunaki crap, and look at our elites now, luciferians doing sacrifices.  Is lucifer just made up crap so the Draco can get their meals? How far is this from the truth, not sure.. or how close?).

You wonder why they would eat kids and shit? Who taught them to do this? Who told them to go all in?

Could it be the Draco? We are not being told the full story.

But its NOT ALL BAD. Read below to find out, the good guys are here, and from my 2 days of almost nonstop research I am more and more convinced that Donald Trump is working with the Labyrinth Group and that Qanon IS this group.

Have you guys seen these videos on youtube of ""black magick"" having these ""magicians"" going and making shit appear out of nowhere? I saw one where an asian dude made an entire, GIGANTIC, loaf of bread appear out of his hand - out of thin air, sitting in the middle of a restaurant.

The Luciferians allowed this to go into the open, they allowed this guy to display LERM as a ""miracle"" or as they call it ""magic"", for 10 million normies et all to gaze upon:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3YLneFhr60

They do it using LERM (Light Encoded Reality Matrix) just one technology/science that they hide from us.

Yesterday I spent 12 hours researching only the WingMakers.

Al Bielek during the Philadelphia Experiment actually ended up being sent to the year 2800 and HE MET THE WINGMAKERS.

They are a HUMAN CIVILIZATION from 750 years in our future who discovered time travel.

They went back to the year 800 A.D. and buried ""time capsule"" sites which include AMAZING music, art, poetry and philosophy. Absolutely none of this is Dark Shit. No occult. No new age. No ""worship the light"" horseshit.

Not only that, but its indicated in the original literature that 6 other sites (7 total) - 7 trumpets? - needed to be found to fully comprehend the Time Capsule and receive the tech for BST (Blank Slate Technology) which is actually a technical way of saying Time Travel.

this is the real deal.

The only content remaining uncensored of this amazing discovered is housed at wingmakers.us which is a site controlled by a true Patriot named ""Fred Burk"" - thank you so much Fred!!!

Guys...

Who are ""The WingMakers"" ?

What is ""The Labyrinth Group"" ?

we are not alone on this planet..

youtube.com/watch?v=xFpes9qWMj4

youtube.com/watch?v=4hxBNJRVoTs&t=4s


WHO IS: The Labyrinth Group?

WHAT IS: The Ancient Arrow Project?

Within the ACIO, there are 14 distinct levels of security clearance. Those who are at level 12 and above are aware of the Corteum/Anunnaki Technology Transfer Program (TTP). >>>There are only 7 who have level 14 clearance. <<<   [Less than 10] - [Qanon]

is Qanon = Labyrinth Group ?

further notes: Phil Schneider was good friends with Al Bielek.

Bielek was involved with the Philadelphia experiment along with his brother Duncan. (think Nicolas Tesla).

Bielek is actually the guy who convinced Phil to come out and do public discourses (he was killed for this months later).

Bielek, as a result of Phi. Experiment. was sent to the year 2800 and met with the WingMakers (no shit!)

Can you people see why this is so huge? Tesla, Trump, Bielek, Schneider.

Phil Schneiders Dad, Oscar Schneider, went on many trips just before World War 2 broke out and even 1 trip just as the war broke out. Oscar would return home with a German, the German would stay at their house 2-3 weeks and eventually just blend into society and dissapear.

YEP, you heard that right, he was bringing NAZI's over from Germany! 

NAZI SCIENTISTS TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

Bieleks father was the Head Medical Tech involved for the Philadelphia Experiment. They discovered time travel,  BY ACCIDENT, of course

if you are not yet freaked out and want more Draco evidence (WARNING, its some disturbing stuff):

youtube.com/user/THEYLIVE2012/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid

CONTINUED:

If you search the web you can find people in India talking about ACIO positions and it states clearly in the original interview transcripts that the ACIO has offices in India, USA and one other country.

Al Bielek telling all about Philadelphia Experiment and how he traveled to the year 2800 and met the WingMakers. 
youtube.com/watch?v=dYE1Oady6Qo&list=PLmqTgSUpRWNvDJSiwue_B_1UB4rSeQaHE

My research indicates he was part of not only Phi. Exp. but also the Montauk Project AND NOT ONLY THAT, he was one of their PROGRAMMERS of what is dubbed ""The Montauk Boys"" <---STRANGER THINGS [MK ULTRA]

For anyone interested listen here and listen CLOSELY. Do you know the name ""Fritz Springmeier"" ?

Fritz Springmeier knew Phil Schneider very very well.

Now let that sink in a moment.

Yes you heard right. Fritz held this information for over 20 years secret. He freaked the fuck out when they found Phil dead. Phil was an MK ULTRA victim and had multiple personalities - part of him breaking free of black projects and going rogue was him trying to not only tell the truth - but to break free of his ACTUAL programming. He was very high up in NATO when he left - head of their top GEOLOGY Department (THINK DEEP UNDERGROUND FUCKING BASES). THIS MAN KNEW ALL, AND TOLD ALL.

Al Bielek found out years later that his real name is Edward Cameron.  And that Duncan Cameron is his brother.  MK Ultra.  Multiple Personalities, like Phil Schneider.  These guys were victims of the MK Ultra program EVEN AS SCIENTISTS IMPLEMENTING THE BLACK PROJECTS.  Now thats twisted. 

OK? Ready for more?

This is a top secret Military wing of the NSA - called ACIO.

in the ACIO, they have created a subgroup of only the top clearances called the Labyrinth Group (12x clearance and above).

There is a leader of the Group and he is known only as Fifteen (15).

The 'whistleblower' who dropped this info on the net in 1997 is a 12x cleared linguistic expert called in to help on the discovery of the Ancient Arrow Project site in New Mexico.

What they discovered was legit.

Consisted of an underground tunnel complex that was perfect, not a pebble anywhere, everything perfect, the site was perfectly preserved for 800 years. Smooth surfaces and they later discovered that they had used some sort of Sound Tech. to carve out the stones (Harmonics, if you find the perfect Harmonic Frequency of a substance (like rock) you can fuck with the matter, its much like the drills they use for the D.U.M.B's as Schneider talks about - he was an expert GEOLOGIST working on black projects).

Only dust was found covering the smooth walls, ceiling and floor because the site is 1,200 years old!

It was carbon dated to have been put there in the year 800 A.D. by time travellers from our current year --> 2800 (from our current timeline I should say). A group who calls themselves the WingMakers.

They found 23 chambers (humans have 23 chromosomes).

Each chamber consisted of 2 pieces of Poetry, one Huge Painting on the wall and an Audio Music Recording corresponding to the chamber. In the 23rd chamber they found an OPTICAL DISC (like a CD-rom) with hieroglyphics on it. It took them 4 years to figure out how to read its contents. It contained 8,100 pages of writings, philosophy and music.

People who viewed this original material as it was dropped on the web (the first and second chamber material was available completely as the translations were done for these 2 chambers and they knew what music and philosophy went to it. It changed peoples lives.

But it gets even more crazy... the linguist, after much studying of their ancient language, started to discover that the entire site is a time capsule. The entire site itself, is a language, its a message.

Now let me tell you, during the interview he made a ball of yarn appear out of thin air for the reporter, just like that, didnt give a fuck.

Then the woman is losing her shit, shes like... wtf? OK can u make a million dollars appear? hes like ""yep, I can"". totally fuckin dead serious hes being... she starts like trying to reason why he should make it appear, how it would help her, essentially shes freaking out.

So she calms down a bit and figures that because she will have to hide away a while after releasing this crazy info, she could certainly use 10,000 bucks it would be really helpful (shes being completely earnest) so the guy is like ""yah sure makes sense"" and literally makes dozens of 100 bills appear out of thin air for her. SHE STARTS LOSING HER SHIT.

This is LERM. This is Light Encoded Reality Matrix - its a SCIENCE the Elite know and use. Creating money out of thin air?

These movies hollywood makes, inception, in the interview they talk about ""intervention points"" relating to BST technology which is TIME TRAVEL.

Certain races in the galaxy already possess BST but they do not use it on us.

There is no real big threat, as per this 12x scientist, from our current galaxy./

But there is a prophecy that is Top Secret, sumerian documents, that they have about an invasion in the future.

An invasion from an Alien race NOT FROM OUR GALAXY

A hivemind like alien race that utilizes essentially drones, like a big fuckin ant colony, and they are a COLONIZATION race.

Singleminded colonization.

Now stop right there - has anyone ever played or seen STARCRAFT?

We are the Terran.

The Protoss is the Annunaki AKA Corteum whom is working the humans to fight against....

THE ZERG.

The Zerg is this hive mind alien race that the ELITE WELL KNOW is prophesied to come and attack us.

SPACE FORCE?

THREAT FROM SPACE?

know what I think?

Labyrinth Group figured out that the attack was delayed to a future date and instead they focused fully on getting Trumper into power.  If Hillary had gotten in, who fuckin knows.   

Remember the footage of Hillary coughing out some green globular object during a speech? That doesnt happen to human beings, as we all know, no matter how much the talking heads on TV talk until their blue in the face (lie until blue in the face). The footage of them ripping a kids face off: her and Huma? Humans do not do that guys.

Frazzled.rip for all the normies who have no clue what I'm talking about -> PizzaGate.

FAKE NEWS is a term that appeared at the SAME TIME as PIZZAGATE.

When Trump refers to FAKE NEWS -> He is talking to the Media and saying ""I KNOW WHAT FAKE NEWS IS COVERING UP FOR YOU, SO I WILL USE THIS TERM BACK ON YOU"".

These are not even human beings.  Refer to much of my Draco (annunaki) evidence pointed to on youtube, the AZUR AZEEN channel as well as marinodelfino will have much good info.

KNOW WHAT I REALLY THINK? I think Trump is a good alien working with the humans (Terrans) to stop these psychopaths and end their feeding of our kids to the bad reptilians ALL THE WHILE planning to fight the incoming Zerg invasion.

Remember Trump tweeting HIMSELF AS PEPE THE FROG?

Frog = Reptile.

He is telling us that he has allied himself, and probably many other good aliens, to fight not only the bad reptilian/other aliens who are against the humans, but also preparing for this incoming invasion. I don't know what other terms to use so fuck it, use starcraft labels.

Guys... I could have much of this wrong, but you know what? It's logical and fits. How can Trump have so much energy when he eats McDonalds and Drinks diet fuckin coke, doing no exercise and just going nonstop. HE AINT HUMAN! LOL< Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. I don't think it matters. Human or Alien, if he loves GOOD. HAS GOOD MORALS. WANTS US TO THRIVE? I say... fuck it. LET THE TRUTH BE HEARD.

SPACE FORCE uses the STAR TREK logo =)

NOTE: For any who want to research this topic, you may note that all available LEGITIMATE footage of reptilian (draco, annunaki) on the web has been manipulated via view and upvote count but more importantly, ALL QUALITY IS 480p or lower and THIS IS BY DESIGN. I am not new to this subject, just only recently found out about wingmakers and ACIO. It was a well hidden - I found it by accident. The Hoax garbage led me to the legit stuff, so a huge CIA failure on that front, HAHAHA!

For those having a hard time reading (or just to pwn agents) ANYTHING with ""Neruda"" in it, and ANYTHING talking about ""Grand Portals"" and ""Ascension"" bullshit and saying we are slaves in a fake reality ARE REPEATING LUCIFERIAN HORSESHIT AND IT IS TO BE IGNORED.

The truth is contained at wingmakers.us ONLY

period.

1930 - Einstein is brought from Germany over to the USA.

Working at CAL tech.

Working at the Institute of Advanced Studies.

Working alongside good buddy Nicolas Tesla

Keep in mind this is all ocurring BEFORE the CIA exists (which was founded in 1947). This was all being conducted as a research project initially.

They were working on an invisibility project for the Military, at Roosevelts direction, he KNEW Tesla was brilliant. I mean they fucking brought over Albert Einstein so it sounds like some serious shit.

Continued until 1940, Al Bielek working on this project alongside his brother Duncan. in January of 1940 a successful test was done in Brooklyn naval yard. The ship was rendered invisible when the equipment was turned on and nobody was on board the ship, for safety. At this point Navy classified it, everybody had to get clearances.

1941 till 1942 project was moved to the back of a shipyard in Philadelphia.

late 1890's tesla makes a coil that breaks a power plant - but its also said he made contact with Another Civilization Not From Our Planet. At this point JP Morgan contacts tesla.

Tesla worked for RCA from 1919 till 1939 as their Chief Engineer. The lie on google saying he was a recluse tries to hide this - yet it was one of the busiest times in Tesla's life IRL.

Held a retirement party for Tesla in 1939 at Cherryhill, NJ.
People since have tried to trace the history of Tesla and RCA but have not been able to find them.
He decided to use the name Nicolas Turbil for some reason at RCA.
Records were later destroyed and Bielek is not sure really why.
In 1931 he was working on the “Free-Energy” business (wow)
Took an auto, ripped out the engine, put in an electric motor and a “little black box” which was essentially free energy that he had developed around the turn of the century.  Jp Morgan wanted no part, as we know.
Put the black box in the Dashboard and plugged it in, and it drove the 75 HP motor of the car (electric).
Self powering car, in 1931. Using free energy in the air.
This secret apparently died with him. Japanese tried to recreate what he did, many years later, and they said “Tesla did it better than us and nobody knows how he did it”.
He developed particle beam weapon and tried to sell to US government. 
Nobody wanted to buy it, not USA, not Canada, but RUSSIA did buy it (rofl). They bought it for 25k cash lol
1935-1936, while working on 'Project Invisibility'

He needed money so bad that he sold that tech to them so cheap.
Eventually the US Govt did provide Tesla a stipend because he was needing money.

He was anything but a recluse.

He knew Roosevelt from years prior (World War 1)

When he met roosevelt again in 1931, he told him about some of the things he had been up to (projects).

He told him he had a good track record and had many projects under his name (successful).

He had 2 laboratories and one of those labs was contained in the twin towers of the Waldorf Astoria hotel.

(Reminds me of ASTORs of Titanic fame, ones against the Fed Reserve who were killed).

Had secret laboratory in New Jersey as well.

He also worked at institute of Advanced Study. Princeton.

Al Bielek worked there also, he asked if they had records of Tesla (this was later after Nikola died).

He was told that nobody who actually worked there and received a paycheque, had files on them kept.

All they had was a folder on Tesla. Contained a telegram (sent from Institute to New York (assume Waldorf Astoria)) announcing Nikola Tesla had died on 7th Jan, 1943 and announcing the plans for his funeral.  This was the only thing in the file.

Back to 1930's.  He had an incredible and impeccable reputation – he never married his whole life.

Tesla was friends with a guy named HILBERT from Germany who was a brilliant mathematician who essentially figured out there was multiple dimensions using Math. 

Tesla learned all his formulas and was fascinated.

This stuff was brought over to USA by Van Neumann and showed to Tesla (institude advanced study princeton)

This was all used in the experiments (Philadelphia exp)

Electricity and current flow, in electrical circuits.

There are elctric fields, magnetic fields, ever heard of “Gravity Field” ?

Mass of the planet determines str. Of Gravity field = incorrect.

Gravity Field is what was used to create a means of access to the time field.

Not many people outside the HARDCORE scientific field understand that time is not an illusion but is in fact a FIELD.  (measurable).

(Al Bielek – whos a smart fucker – is trying to break it down how this all works for us (laymen)).

He says Gravity Field, Electrical field and Magnetic field all form basically an equilateral triangle (they all work together). 

At 3 points of the triangle. 
If you interconnect these 3 fields using electronics, which they took many many years to figure out how this all works and how to build the hardware and setup these fields working together..

you setup electronics and electronic means, to properly interact together, it develops (gives access to?) the Time Field.

This is a small localized field, It depends how much power you put into it. You can access it, and manipulate the time field, for effects which as local.
Think about a donut.  A torroidal structure resembling a donut.
Time is a closed loop, a closed circuit.

There is no beginning and there is no ending (infinity chan logo? 8Chan)
There is a point where you can say it is PLUS or MINUS infinity but this is a mathematical concept that perhaps doesn't have any feeling in reality, you might say there is a beginning and ending and you can go through that point.

This is a concept, Alpha and Omega, 
We are at some point in the time field.

Think of a line around the edge of this donut, this is the reality edge of time, the 3 vectors.  Time can be measured with a clock.  Time has another aspect, another vector called T2, which is at right angles to the linear flow.  It controls T1, they combine for the time field.

In you go to T2 and affects things there, it affects T1.

They created a time field.

If you can create a field large enough to surround an object, you can hide the ship basically.  This field affects time around the object, with enough power, can make the field bigger.

The field creates a rotation around the object (torroidal field) which causes so that light can pass through the field, the object is invisble essentially.
The light is being reflected back by the time field.

No return of light, no image.  Sounds simple, but its really not.
If you make the index of refraction of the ship = 1 , then it is invisible.
It bends light.

Tesla involved in this all the up until March 1942. When they heard he made the little ship small, Roosevelt contacted him and asked him to do it with a big ship, and everything was classified.  It was moved to Philadelphia.

Tesla had Einstein as a consultant.

Many brilliant people involved.

Al Bielek had been sent out, with his brother Duncan, out on a ship with a home dock being PHILADELPHIA in 1940 ship called the Pennsylvania arrived to pearl harbor as ship was due for overhaul in Oct 1941.

So they went to Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, and then left to go on leave for 2 months.  On Dec 5th, 1941 they were supposed to head back to Pearl Harbour but they were intercepted and told not to go back because there would be an attack on the island and the people at Princeton did not want them  on the island then.

And 2 days later the attack happened,  They had known for 2 months, everybody on the island, that an attack was coming from Japan they just didn't know when.  This lie (surprise attack) was ofc used to get AMERICA into the War.

As they worked back in Princeton in 1941 on Philadelphia experiment, on a huge battleship, they installed the equipment in the ship and began doing testing but Tesla was worried that the coils and equipment would be too powerful for the sailors who would be aboard if they were to ever try and use the equipment.  Tesla tried to tell them to put back the date for the test but was told

DERP MERP THERE IS A WAR ON MR. TESLA, THE DATE IS FIRM.

But on the night before the first test he went around and sabotaged some equipment so the test would fail the next day.

At this point, Tesla left the project (wow)

Van Neuymann was assigned to replace him.

First thing he did was try to figure out what had gone wrong – it did not take him long to figure out what had gone wrong.
He wanted to redesign the system.
He decided he wanted to scrap the analog system – he decided instead of continuous raditation field he wanted to use instead a PULSE field.  It was more efficient in his view.
Van Neuymann was a very strange man, he had the ability to not only conceptualize his opinion but also build the hardware to make his work, brilliant.
Good at Math, Good Engineer.
He decided they needed not only a Pulse System, but that they needed a ship specifically designed from the ground up, for this project.
(Bielek now describes the various modifications that Van Neuymann requested of the Navy Ship Builders at their site, Newark Shipyard).
Asked them to provide a hollow gun turret, leave it all gutted out.
Ship was ready in summer of 1942.
DE-173 (USS Eldridge) was transferred to Philadelphia Navy Yard to install some very heavy equipment.

They were using Megawatts of Power (Diesel Generator) @ 1.6 Mhz
Alot of heavy equipment was fitted on the ship.

Here Al stops talking and mentions how the Black Budgets are always 50 and even sometimes 100 years ahead in technology.

What he is saying to the idiot normies is to fucking undo what you think is possible, completely WIPE IT CLEAN because YOU DON't KNOW WHAT IS POSSIBLE.

Finnally in the summer of 1943 the first of the total of two tests began.
There was a Capt Harrison who was kind of the head coordinator for the testing – he was the first Native American to ever get to the rank of Capt in the Navy.

He was observing the invisble ship for 20 mins while the equipment was turned on but saw a problem – he noticed that the waterline which should show at least an outline of where the ship should be – was ALSO INVISIBLE.
So he ordered they turn off the equipment.


They confirmed during the test that the ship was also completely invisible to Radar.

Also noted that much of the crew that on the upper deck complained of “mental issues”, as Tesla had warned.

July 1943 first test with the volunteer crew, after much training and preparation.

The first test  the ship kind of faded out of view like special FX in movies, but REAL. Not an illusion.

It was invisible to the eye and also invisible to the radar.

It was mandated by the very head of the Navy, an Admiral, that the tests be completed by 12 August or that they were to drop the test.  Highly unusual and we do not know why this happened, they never got the answer till the late 1980's.

With a lot of research they did find out eventually but it would take way too long to explain now.

They worked around the clock as a result, on the project.

The reasoning was that at night in a convoy you must be able to see the ship somewhat with optical sight, because of dangers with own allied ships.  What they really wanted was the radar invisibility.

By 9 August 1943, when they were getting ready for the final test, everybody started getting this very uneasy, odd, queasy feeling.  Like something was wrong.

There was one crew member who almost bed ridden because he was so nervously thinking about a feeling of impending doom.

Comes the 12th of August, they had a final party the night before at the Blue Lagoon Bar.

They board the ship, it goes down the harbour, they have 3 observer ships nearby.

Set for the test.  At the apropriate hour – everything was turned on by radio link.

The ship became radar invisible, but you could still see the shop via a green fog – highly ionized ozone around the ship.  Producing a greenish fog, allowing them to optically see the ship.

But after 70 seconds, there was a blue flash of light, and suddenly everything dissapeared.  No more USS Eldridge.

No communication.  Nobody knew what happened, nobody had any concept of what was happening until the ship returned FOUR HOURS LATER at the same place in the harbour.

Statistics and meaning of name Jamisson

Usage: 72% firstname, 28% surname.
Jamisson [NERUDA] first name was found 31 times in 3 different countries.
Surname Jamisson is used at least 12 times in at least 2 countries. (USA,Australia)

""Jamisson Neruda"" why did the spooksters choose to use this particular name? what does it mean? could it connect to the actual whistleblower or reporter that dissapeared back in 1998-1999 ?

I'm 1 hour into The Matrix (1999) -> Don't forget this WingMakers stuff all became applicable again in 1994, that's when the rockslide occurred, and let me tell you that this movie is a GIGANTIC redpill on more than we thought.  Is fifteen = Neo aka The One ? Or a dramatized version of him.

I imagine the ""Agents"" as the CIA who are run by the cabal and surely contain tons of these Draco....

trippy stuff

It is very much recommended to go down the rabbit hole on this WingMaker material, and then rewatch The Matrix.

Everything we discuss as conspiracies IS ONE BIG CONSPIRACY via the damn archons/luciferians and other negative assholes working against good.  Good vs Evil.  Most people just cannot even see who/what is good and who/what is evil.  BY DESIGN.

TL;DR READ THIS POST AND WAKE UP. The more we all wake up, the more their system BREAKS DOWN and GOOD CAN PREVAIL.

This is how I see it personally, from my research over 15 years.

It is purely my opinion but I invite any and all to dispute anything I have said or to even ask questions and I will do my very best to answer the best I can.

Thanks for reading.

(context: I am speaking regarding Trumps comments re: Israel in the UN speech yesterday afternoon)

I also heard his references to Israel being in the crosshairs -- cannot recall the exact words -- but it definitely pricked my ears up when he said that. It was a very odd reference he made re: Isis-Ra-EL in any case.

Someone ought to go pickup the exact quote as he said it because it was the only time he referred to the country of isis-ra-el in the speech, any other times he would just say 'The Jewish People'.

He knows, that all woke people know, that isis-ra-el is just a fake country hiding behind judaism to stir up a shit storm in the middle east. Just more Luciferian shenanigans in the end.

worshiping the negative in the world to try and get ahead, also known as Service To Self instead of Service To Others.

The funny thing is they were all lied to (luciferians) and satan/lucifer has no intention on bringing them into his ""new world"", he/they just wants us ALL dead, all of us. He wants to be God but that's not in the cards.

Literally the Source Creator, Optimus Prime, Prime Creator, can send in Wanderers (and very well has, Jesus?) to assist us in our mission. Because there IS a mission, there is a goal. This is what the Luciferians have tried to hide from us.

When these fuckers ""fell"" (Fallen Angels) they lost completely their connection to Prime Creator. They do not have their ""Energy"" supply refilled by Source as we humans do. They broke that connection completely to be able to do what they are currently doing - attempting to enslave all of humanity - in this archon slave matrix using Saturn and energies coming from the Orion Star System.

In more simple terms, they are using technology that we don't know about, to really fuck with us. They are deploying technology and other tools/stooges on astral planes and other levels, implants -- weapons in otherwords -- to fuck with humans.

Go Google for ""Toplet Bombs"" this is one their main weapons since the 1996 Congo Invasion of the archons (via a Portal over there).

The Moon is an artificial body. Why do all other celestial bodies SPIN except our fucking moon? Hello?

It is always facing the same way, it is not a fucking celestial object, IT IS MASKED TO BE ONE. Like all bullshit that scammers and con-artists do, its more FAKERY!

FAKE NEWS.

It's a fucking form of space ship. What is the best way to keep us all from knowing the truth? simple.

Hide the fact aliens exist. Make it all look and sound ridiculous.

Have Memory Replacement Tech?

Make it look ridiculous in Men In Black.

That's called psychological warfare on a nearly global scale.

When you take a big deep breath, step back from it all, and look at all the pieces of the puzzle.

When you stop zoning into ""limited hangouts"" (which the C_A and other clown orgs PURPOSEFULLY put in places to keep you distracted, you miss out on whats really happening.

When you don't verify the sources (I'm guilty of this too, I used to follow Alex Jones ffs!) you are opening yourself up to be lost down a limited hangout rabbit hole (or black hole) of nothingness.

So take a piece here, a piece over there, take them all together and try to make an image with the pieces.

If one piece doesn't fit anywhere, likely that its not even a real puzzle piece to consider - and then you think to yourself - thank god I didn't waste a fuckton of time down that waste of time rabbit hole...

For example I know the intel orgs and others have created fake serial killers to fuck with people, it's a psyop, they did it with many of these ""Serial killers"". did it create real copy cats with sick fucks following their lead? Yep. Was that the whole purpose of these psyops? Not entirely, but partly.

What happened to all those infomercials from the 80's talking about this epidemic of missing kids in the USA? It was insane numbers like 600,000 kids each year, even 800k KIDS ALONE! ONLY KIDS.

A literal PANDEMIC EPIDEMIC HOLYFUCK level of kids missing and... all of a sudden... all those reportings VANISH. They stopped with no explanation.

Like the problem was fixed one day to the next, they had stopped all the missing kids from going missing.

But they didn't.

So why? Did they gain control of the media and choose to obfuscate reality once again, as it IS AN INTEGRAL PART of how the archons sustain their immortal lives currently? By feeding on us?

If we all wake up and destroy their wells, destroy all their control infrastructure, educate ourselves, would the archons die?

YES.

And then you begin to understand how this ties to Saturn-Moon-Orion energies.

How this is feeding ""Wells"" that are setup in astral plane to harness all this sexual deprivation energy from all their programming, from sucking up the energy released when they torture/mess with/abuse kids in any way you can imagine, or anybody for that matter, when a murder happens, it all feeds these wells.

This is how the Archons stay alive.

They have lost their replenishment-cycle so they have replaced it with this, to stay alive.

This is why wars are so prevalent all throughout our history.  What better way to replenish the Archon's cells than with mass slaughter? The more the better.  So their Luciferian representative humans on the 3D plane gladly follow orders and make sure these wars take place regularly.  To make sure human sacrifice continues for thousands of years since Babylon and beyond.

How to hide it all? Very easy, re-write history and hide everything.

In a Galactic context, humans live very short lives, shorter and shorter it seems as time goes by, as they poison and attack us from every level, so our memory is short.

Within a few generations, things are forgotten if not written down -- this is why the Luciferians go so hard AFTER THE KIDS.

They play the long con, the archons do.  They control this current reincarnation cycle in the matrix system and can guarantee favorable reincarnation into the luciferian elite control systems where they remain rich doing w.e they want as long as they keep the system going.  It's the deal they made.

Fuck the rest of us, is their mentality.

NO MORE!

And this jsut goes on and on, the ""ELite"" have hidden so much shit its just out of this world (no pun intended).

EL is Saturn.

god EL

isis-ra-el

remember in Stargate when the marines are fighting RA?

in Egypt?

They (the archons) have modified all religious texts to obfuscate the Law of One teachings from the One Source Creator (where we go ONE, we go ALL (cause we are one)). They modified the texts, VERY CLEVERLY (nobody said they were not cunning) to have major religions fighting with one another.

They distorted the original teachings of the Wanderers who incarnated here.

So what is basically happening now, is a race has arrived from the ""Cosmic Center"". In the center of our cosmos is the Galactic Central Sun which has a heartbeat itself, it sends out energies across the entire galaxy every 26,000 years and every 3 cycles is an ascension cycle (probably wrong term here) but when the thing has beat 3 times, ~75,000 years, we got hrough this cycle and yep its about to happen.

WingMakers aka Central Cosmic Race has found we have enough people on our planet waking up to the evil, waking up their consciousness, that were ready to proceed with purging the evil once and for all.

The Evil is a glitch in the Matrix. It was never supposed to be, as per the original design of the First Firmament.

Fuck these people, in otherwords.

The negative e.t.s working with them is a veritable list worthy of Star Trek (space force logo anybody?):

Dragon Moth from Orion Black hole system.

Necromiton beetle hominid, Men in Black from Nibiruian lines.

Marduk Omicron from Alpha Centuari.

Centaur Hybrids from Omega Centauri.

Zeta from Rigel, Zeta Drakonian Agendas. (reptilians?)

Zeta From Zeta Reticuli.

Rigelians

and many many subraces in these groups. some within the groups have turned against Evil realizing or reacquiring their sanity when you think about it.

but guys, can you see how much we are being lied to?

try to prove me wrong, on any point. 15 years into this stuff searching for THE truth.
