Take for example driverless cars, bitcoin, smarter AI assistants that lead to internet of things, virtual reality, alternative energy... all these things that should take off within 5-10 year timeframe, that have not so much to do one with another, but if you look at them, they are really connected. And they will really change how we operate as species. 

With driverless cars you are effectively out of control as regards your transport. That means more time for online activities, and here comes VR. You can use VR in a driverless car and it will be used, and e-commerce will move there, eventually locking you in. If you can order your food and anything else in VR, you have automated robots and maybe even your appliances themselves order things via always on internet, essentially there is this huge amount of time added that you do not need to spend interacting with people in real life. Also, I think with more jobs that are left moving to intellectual type of work, work from home enabled by gamifying elements of VR will also take off, so it's again less time to socialize with people who are not your family/nerd-family online.

This impacts society in a way that gated communities will exist not only in real life, but online too. People already have become more extreme, due to insulation. News that you get from facebook are essentially based on what you like. If you like one article about migrant crime in Europe, you will get 10s of them that make it seem all migrants do are rape, pillage etc. Everybody lives in their own happy bubbles. That's one real concern for future. When you have driverless car that gets you from garage to garage or door to door, even if they are in different countries (and cheap, due to cheap alternative energy in future or even cheap gas, as it will get cheaper trying to remain competitive), does not let you talk to people who have opposing views. It just creates new clans and clannish behaviour. 

Furthermore, it will be a lot about losing the sense of identity. Not only due to being a part of these groups or lack of originality of ''everything's already done'', but if you have smart AI assistants you will eventually have your own ''doubles'' in VR. If you do not have time for something, or want to talk with somebody and find out their thoughts but have to talk to other 4 people, or just need to have a more efficient answering machine, you could create an assistant who is a copy of your mannerisms, has your core beliefs, knows what you like and how you like it and hold conversations with other people similarly like you would. So nobody would know when the real person is talking and when the double is talking. And if you die (as we have not yet solved aging), the double would perhaps just stay there and engage in conversations all the time... and learn from them. Does that mean you are dead, or in essence you are not? Perhaps, for example, this double could be worked into your tombstone, so when somebody approaches, you can talk with the deceased. An interesting idea. 

A lot of today's problems with world, if we are not talking about extremism that is bound to become even worse, I'm afraid, is the lack of food and overpopulation, us slowly destroying the planet etc. But these are all non-problems in a sense that I do not see that they are hard to overcome. Soon enough fake meat from plant products will have the same taste and in other aspects be even better than real meat, so to an extent we will be able to cut the least humane aspects of our food production to a certain degree. The number of really poor people in the world is decreasing all the time, population growth is slowing down and existing overcrowded areas will be eventually cleared by local conflicts and migration of people which is taking place on an unprecedented level now and will only become worse in future. As regards pollution, even without fusion energy, we will be able to get a cleaner energy mix soon enough. I don't see them as major long term problems, I see a problem with clannish behaviour though and partially I can see a kind of neo-luddite movement arising not only in Muslim countries but in other places too, because the AI and the blurring the lines of what's real with AI and intelligent assistants/virtual doubles will make many people uneasy.

At the moment I can honestly say I fail to see our space exploration dreams realized. We will have space mining in the future, but it will done by intelligent robots and that's actually where I see first most sophisticated AI beings ''evolve'', as due to time delay in communications, they will need to operate independently and make independent decisions... but then again I have doubts about it because nobody sends untested, new equipment up there and it takes a while for these things to go to asteroid belt or Mars, and with exponential technology development it could be so that they will be obsolete in Earth tech terms even before the rocket leaves Earth. But definitely either SpaceX or some other efforts will further democratize space and private entrepreneurs will go there.

However I do not see a bright future in space for humans and that is again due to VR. With increased complexity of AI and virtual environments we can create, there will not be as much of an incentive to spend time on lifeless rocks or to leave the planet en masse. And anyways, it will not happen in 30 years, at best some manned Mars mission to appease the public, but I really think that when the new kind of AI and VR kicks in in a few years, about 2020, people' interest in space will sort of diminish a bit. When you have a game like No Man's Sky and add to it more complex generation of planets and self evolving AI creations, Mars could kinda not be as interesting anymore. Sure, people are explorers, but when there will be tons of things to explore in VR, perhaps only handful of people or luddites of this new age will still be interested in solid rocks. 

I definitely think that we live in interesting times and what I wanted to really say is, I do not see our future in moving externally, instead its direction will be directed towards the inner things. Our focus will be efficiency, how many things we will be able to stack on other things to still have better VR environments as last year, our focus will be immersion and how to make AI more lifelike. Eventually it could lead to us merging with AI to enhance us even further and at that time the efficiency and Moore's law will not just be a choice but lifestyle. But again, the issue is how this will play with the clannish behaviours. Perhaps some people will be left behind forever? Some people could just receive their basic income and fight with each other until ''progressives'' become too machine like and forget about them, and the rest of humanity reverts back to savagery while the most advanced part migrates to something unknown, like some black hole to try and figure that out and how it could improve efficiency. But that's far away future. 

This is essentially how I cope with Fermi paradox. My assumption is that:
1) you can't be a space faring civilization without discovering Moore's law
2) Moore's law is real law, that's what happens when civilization reaches certain point in its development
3) When you discover it, you can't help but follow it, upon following it you can't help but become part of it
4) By following it, you alter yourself so much (and in really short time frame) that lesser civilizations are not interesting to you in any way
5) Part of Moore's law is efficiency, so even when you expand, your ''footprint'' is not as large as for lesser civilizations to be able to discover you
6) you would tend to migrate towards/manufacture massive black holes i.e. where lesser civilizations cannot live, not only because of massive energy needs but also due to the essential need to explore something really unknown and be able to figure them out. 

Essentially the argument is that for any advanced species to become space faring, it needs to be curious and exploration oriented. Upon understanding Moore's law and seeing increase in computation, their curiosity/exploration urges will move into this direction. Some members of such civilization could stay behind and follow traditional path, but here's another thing- suppose it is impossible (money, funds wise) to create Dyson spheres and other such things without venturing further down the rabbit hole/ Moore's law path, without stronger AI presence. But with stronger AI, you are tempted to enhance yourself. However, if you enhance yourself, you would soon lose interest in other civilizations, as your development would be exponential and you would not be able to be on the same plane of comprehension with lesser civilizations. 

Many people will object saying that this requires ALL CIVILIZATIONS to go down the same path, but what if it's what happens. To be a space faring civilization REQUIRES a civilization 1) to be curious and want to explore 2) to understand the concept of scientific progress (where we got only in 18th century) 3) to be able to build a rocket and leave the atmosphere 4) to have calculating machines to go where you want. Once you have calculating machines, Moore's law is the reality. Maybe not like it is here, but the general idea of exponential progress in computing. And then you get into AI territory and merging with the machines and you become something entirely else.
