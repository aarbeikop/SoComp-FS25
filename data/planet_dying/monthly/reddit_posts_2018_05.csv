"8jigp1","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","My grandma’s driving me insane","My grandma is 88, and from an outside perspective she’s a BAMF. She was the of a foreign service officer who came to the states knowing very little English and basically created an awesome life for herself. She’s met a myriad of significant political figures and she has all sorts of fascinating stories about growing up and living overseas. Beat cancer that she should have died from at 85. She’s really a character when she’s with other people. 

But to live with her is a fucking nightmare. It used to be ok because she lived on the other side of the country, and she had my grandfather to pester, but he’s dead now. She’s moved into our neighborhood so I see her every day and she is the most toxic person to spend time with. She is this endless ball of negativity - nothing is ever good enough for this woman. It’s always this needs to be fixed or this isn’t good enough or this looks bad or this tastes bad. There’s hardly ever anything wrong, but if you heard her narrate the world you would think we were all about to fall off the face of the planet because of all these little things. Everything that comes out of anyone’s mouth is fair game. It just crushes your self-esteem and sense of worth when everything you ever do is criticized to the nth degree. 

She also has a really strange perspective on food - it’s cultural to an extent but it still is so unbelievably maddening. She’s obsessed with food. She’s a fantastic cook, but the first question out of her mouth when she sees you is “have you eaten? Are you hungry?” I’ll say “No thank you, I ate” or “No thank you, I’m not hungry” and she will just push and push and push me to eat. I’m honestly so concerned about how she is shaping my relationship with food now - I watch myself eating less and less, especially in front of people because I fear the constant badgering. Eat more, eat less, too much junk food, not enough protein. I don’t eat breakfast and I don’t really eat lunch anymore. It’s  a constant stream of nagging and negativity and it’s just not worth the hassle.

I understand she doesn’t mean to be cruel, but both myself and my mother have spoken to her on numerous occasions about why her actions are inappropriate and she can’t or won’t change. I understand that her nagging is mostly out of love, and some people will think I’m taking her for granted, but the impact on my mental health and the family dynamic on the whole has been staggering. When you’re surrounded in a tornado of negativity, it is so hard to be positive. I want her out of my life. I wish her no ill will, but she’s fucked up my uncle and my mom (major depressive episodes, unhealthy communication, fixation on food) and I will not let her fuck me or my brother up.

"8gyh6j","vegan","unknown","Language for Animal Liberation (Part 2)","If you didn’t see [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/7lhnyo/language_for_animal_liberation/) of this post a few months back, feel free to go back and check it out! 

Much of the following I learned from a Colleen Patrick-Goudreau presentation on language, the full version can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biQjgj5dTP0). 

Language is an incredibly powerful tool in our everyday lives. The way we speak and communicate with others shapes the way we think.  Understanding this can allow us to use language to liberate non-human animals. 

Through our language we all participate in a system that reinforces non-human animals as lesser beings and reinforces their status as commodities. Let’s learn how to start using language to liberate non-human animals! 

# Animals versus non-human animals 

Something you may have noticed already is that I am distinguishing between non-human animals and human animals when I speak or write. Perhaps you’ve noticed other vegans doing this too! 

No, it is not just to be very specific, it’s an intentional choice to use language to help break down the arbitrary line that is often drawn between humans and non-human animals. 

How many times have you been talking to a non-vegan and they say that it’s justified to eat animals because they are “bred for that purpose”. We point out that if we bred humans for the purpose of eating them, that wouldn’t justify it. And they fire back: 

**”Humans and animals are different”**. 

Of course, what’s absent from everyone’s mind in this conversation is that humans **are** animals. When we’re reminded of that fact, the “humans and animals are different” justification becomes laughably nonsensical.

The reason many non-vegans feel justified in exploiting non-human animals is because they see them as categorically different than humans. For them, the mere title of *human* is something that warrants moral consideration in a fundamentally different way than any other species. We know this distinction is meaningless and discriminatory (it’s speciesism) but non-vegans do not recognize that. 

Every time you say “non-human animals”, you are reminding everyone listening that humans *are* animals. And that’s *really important* when the exploitation of non-human animals is being perpetuated by the belief that humans are somehow “above” or “removed from” the status of animal. 

If you want to see this in action, you can see a post where I made the distinction that reached r/all [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/844fm1/canada_has_terrible_transport_laws_for_nonhuman/?sort=new). There were a few comments of confusion, people saying “isn’t non-human animals redundant”. We’re there to remind them it’s not redundant. Humans *are* animals, stop imagining us as some sort of special being beyond every other animal species on this planet. 

# The Word “Meat”

A brief history lesson: The word “meat” actually comes from the Old English word “mete” which just meant “solid food”. Typically, the word “meat” is reserved for animal flesh now; however we still use meat in non-animal flesh contexts such as coconut meat or nut meat. 

Many of us know and love Field Roast Sausages and Tofurkey Deli Slices and unfortunately, I often hear vegans refer to these as “faux” or “fake” meats. Keeping in mind our history lesson above, and the use of the word meat currently to not just mean animal flesh, it’s perfectly legitimate to refer to Field Roast Sausages as “plant-based meats”. Calling them fake or faux undermines them as food. As vegans, we don’t eat fake food! It’s real food and it’s good! How many people do you think want to try food that we refer to as fake? 

Don’t let the rest of society dictate what is “real” meat or “fake” meat. When we refer to our foods as faux/fake or substitutes, we accept and reinforce the current cultural standard where animal flesh is supreme and everything else we create to consume needs to attempt to replicate it. The reality is, animal flesh is what needs to no longer be seen as food. We want a world where animal flesh is not viewed as a commodity for human purposes; so let our language reflect that. Field Roast Sausages are not just some replacement or imitation, they are real food!

When people ask me if I eat meat or not, I always tell them I do, I just eat “plant-based” meats. And I don’t use meat to refer to exclusively animal flesh. It’s not “I don’t eat meat”, it’s “I don’t eat animals”. Because that’s the reality; in a lot of ways, meat is a euphemism to remove ourselves from the fact that we’re consuming the flesh of a once living being. Cow flesh sounds a lot less appetizing than meat or beef. If our language doesn’t accept these euphemisms, we move people one step closer to making the connection that they are eating a once-living animal. 

# One Letter Can Change Everything 

Here’s a fun game to see the power of language. Go up to a non-vegan friend and ask them if they eat chicken. You’re likely to get a yes and something to the effect of: “I love chicken, I eat chicken all the time”. 

Watch what happens when you add one letter to your question and ask: “Do you eat chicken**s**. People will hesitate… chickens? I eat chicken, not *chickens*. 

Chicken conjures an image of the dismembered animal, like chicken wings. Chicken**s** conjures an image of the living being and helps re-connect people to the individuals they’re eating. 

One of Carnism’s strongest defense mechanisms is abstraction, the idea that pigs, cows and chickens are not individuals and that they are all the same. Adding the plural to chicken gives these beings their individuality back. 

The same can be done with turkeys, fishes, ducks etc. 

# Animal “Products” 

This is really a bonus one, because it’s very hard to avoid! 

Everytime we use the phrase “animal products” we validate and reinforce the current social paradigm where non-human animals and their secretions are commodities. This is the opposite of what we are trying to do! (i.e. liberating non-human animals from property/commodity status). 

When writing, you can put products in quotations (“products”) to resist the socially accepted status of non-human animals as commodities. 

When speaking, I typically refer to animal meat as “animal flesh”. This is accurately what it is and it does make people pause. As discussed above, animal flesh sounds a lot less appetizing to most than beef or pork. It reminds us all of the individual victim that to die so we can consume their flesh. 

As for eggs, honey and dairy, I usually go with “secretions”. It’s accurate and has the same effect in that it gives people pause. It *reminds* people that there was an individual that secreted the egg they are eating.

"8hoxux","futurology","unknown","Some Thoughts on the Fragility of the Future","The likelihood of a highly technological civilization, in which few are actively engaged in STEM, remaining stabile decreases with the advancement of technology. In other words, the further it progresses, the less likely it is to progress further. I may be being pessimistic, but it may be that such a civilization - our civilization - is a Jenga tower and will rapidly reach a point where any instability will cause it to crash to the ground. 

There’s a reason for this inherent lack of robustness. Our society, as Carl Sagan once said, is exquisitely dependent upon science and technology, and yet hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology. One only need to listen to anyone from the Congressional Committee on Science, Space and Technology to realize that. We carry some great and terrible baggage with us: our civilization was built by a bunch of fairly lazy ape-like creatures who meandered off the savannah some quarter million years ago. The majority of us, left to our own devices, would happily vegetate, playing games and eating whatever food required the least effort. We’re certainly not genetically disposed to cracking open a textbook on quantum chromodynamics when boredom strikes. 

Given this, it’s easy to see how we got where we are today. Although a few genetic outliers, freaks and geeks have gifted us with some amazing technologies, most of us apes have absolutely no idea how they work - and, importantly - no idea where to even begin if they stop working. Let’s take a look at transistor-based computing. This is a technology that runs our entire planet, and yet very few of us know how a computer works, much less how to repair one. If we do know how to repair one, our knowledge likely stops at swapping broken parts for new ones. But what if you had to replace the central processor, and there were no replacements? Firstly, you would have to be able to refine silicon and bake it into wafers. You’d have to learn how to build clean rooms and laser cutting machines, high-resolution photolithography, and a thousand other things that a multi-billion dollar industry is built on. If any one of those technologies is lost, the entire industry is shut down until that ability is recovered. What if you lost the ability to produce blue lasers? Uncountable petabytes of information are now lost forever. 

Every single piece of foundational technology that we’re dependent upon can be thought of as a single block in a Jenga tower. Pull out one, and maybe you just lose that capability - or maybe you lose the entire tower. Every day, we build the tower higher, adding more and more interesting, complex, and fragile blocks. Each block depends on all of the blocks beneath it.

Critically, almost no one inhabiting the tower know anything about blocks, or where they come from, or what happens if you lose one. And absolutely no one in the tower knows all of the blocks and what they do and how they work. It is a tower that is inherently fragile, and it only gets more fragile the higher it goes. 

What is the solution? Well, one could take the apocalyptic view and resign oneself to the fact that one day the tower will collapse, humanity will enter a new Dark Age, and we’ll rebuild the tower once again from the ground up. And we could certainly do that. Billions would die in misery and we’d lose one or two millennia in the process. There’s also the problem of depleted natural resources. In the near term, we’ve shot Earth's wad building Civilization 1.0. Earth won’t have the ability to let us build 2.0 for another 50,000 years or so.

An alternative might be yet more technology. CRISPR and GAI offers interesting possibilities, perhaps adding an layer of strengthening infrastructure around our tower by allowing us to make ourselves smarter, less predisposed to sloth, and gifting us with vast memories. If the majority of humanity were more cognizant of technology and science, and had GAI partners to assist us - providing vast amounts of memory and computing power - any one of us could grasp, repair, rebuild and even advance the technology we rely on. 

In fact, I think this is the only viable solution. We live in a fragile tower, and our only option is to keep building higher.
