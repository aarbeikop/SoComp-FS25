Once you understand that any economy that isn't growing, no, isn't growing *quickly* is dying, with no middle ground, you'd think it would be obvious. We have adopted a system that requires infinite growth at an infinitely increasing rate, on a planet with finite resources.

What?

**WHAT?**

I don't understand what's stopping people from understanding this. It should be basic math. Can the required resources of endless capitalistic success be represented by a number? No. Can our resources? Yes, they can. Infinity is a larger concept than whatever that number will be, and infinity is the reason we cannot represent the needs of Capitalism as a number.

So why on Earth can nobody get it?","2018-11-26 11:22:31","799","406","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/a0iicq/how_do_people_not_get_the_capitalism_problem/","True","4GN05705","1747917890.985526","our planet is dying","manual"

I'm scared out of my mind

The planet has what, maybe two years before it's game over.  I heard we have 10 years a while ago, but it seems like every week we see a new headline saying it's worse than we thought, and faster than we expected.

Until six days ago, I didn't vote.  I saw a rigged system that was bought and paid for, and thought electoral politics was an insult to one's intelligence.  Others have different opinions on the importance of voting, but one thing can be very clear.  Voting, in our system, will never be enough.  

We, the royal, collective we, need to disrupt the system, and there will never be a convenient time.  The number of days we have left is dwindling.

Working date is January 15.  I originally thought the 1st, for symbolic reasons, but a large portion of workers are off anyway that day.  We need disruption, civil disobedience.

It has to start somewhere, likely it won't be with this.  I just want to get a ball, any ball, some god-forsaken-shot-in-the-dark-I-don't-wanna-die-ball, rolling.","2018-11-10 23:39:58","316","73","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9vz2fj/general_strike_to_save_the_planet_january_15_2019/","True","homestar440","1747918115.686503","our planet is dying","manual"

"" Death is not pretty...an no-one likes it. But at the end of the day....no matter what choice we make, there are going to be repercussions.  The act of existing takes resources from somewhere to redirect it to our being. It’s the circle of life that has happened for millions of years. Our job is to look at things logically and pick the choice that leaves the smallest impact and allows nature to flourish. By hunting one deer a year.... One animals life is taken (that lived in the wild, free in nature, was never abused, was killed efficiently and quickly, passed on its genetics and took no resources to grow). For the equivalent amount of protein needed from a vegan diet I’d argue thousands of animals would die vs one. For agriculture habitat is stripped away to plant crops...leaving countless animals and plants unable to survive. Countless animals are killed as pests (millions of rabbits, mice,  rats, deer, skunks, birds, opossums and countless invertebrates). Water is rerouted from rivers and lakes to irrigate crops leaving habitats barren and destroyed (look at the dry dying forests of CA). Soil is stripped of it’s natural bounty that allows plants to grow naturally. Rainforests are cut down for  the increasing demand of soy. And lets not forget the carbon footprint agriculture has on the planet...and the tons of fuel used to transport crops. This does not even take into account that hunting funds most of the wild areas in the USA. This is just on a the basis of what leaves the smallest impact on the planet and is the kindest to animals. “

"9wiepd","conspiracy","unknown","Did the World end in 2012?","Hi guys, before I get into this I just wanted to say something. I realize some of you are getting sick of me posting so much. To those people: don’t worry, this is my last thread for a while. This thread is purely conjecture and something that is beyond our capacity to really prove. So please, keyboard warriors and hyper-intellectuals, go easy on me.

I’ve wanted to talk about this subject for a while now. The other day I had a random urge to look into it again and read some old stuff. You know, just for ‘fun’. Ever since then, about two weeks ago, I’ve noticed other people talking about it again. But the strangest part is.. I can not find anything online about it anymore. Like I said, you can find people talking about it causally or joking about it.. but I can not find ANY of the in depth material I had read before. Did ALL of those people delete their content?

This has actually been really frustrating for me because now I have nothing to refresh my memory while writing this. I’ve found a few things here and there that are helping me piece the puzzle together again, but I know there used to be so much more out there. I really can’t even remember the first time I’ve heard this theory but it’s become somewhat of a meme. I did find a video of Max Laughan, that ‘child genius’ from YouTube, touch on this theory, but I don’t think he’s the first person to talk about it.

So did the world actually end in 2012? Well, it was the year scientists at CERN finally found the Higgs Boson, you know, the particle Stephen Hawking predicted could destroy the universe, or in his own words cause the universe to “undergo a catastrophic vacuum decay.” Well, what would happen if we destroyed the universe? Would we know? Maybe CERN accidentally created a black hole that sucked us in and we’ve been living inside it. Physicists actually believe that might be a possibility. 

There’s the old cliche argument that nothing has ‘felt right’ since 2012. I agree with this. Maybe it has something to do with ‘growing up’ and getting older, but ever since then it seems like the world descends more and more into chaos each day. There’s some sort of calamity happening almost daily. Mass shootings only stay in the headlines for like 12 hours now. Did we all die and go to Hell? I don’t really believe that, but some people do.

I think we’re in a simulation. I think after the universe was destroyed by CERN, our collective consciousness was moved into a computer generated copy of our world. The copy is almost exact. The minor differences we notice are what we call Mandela Effects.

There was someone on 4chan a while back who claimed they were one of the 23 scientists at CERN responsible for creating the Mandela effect. They claimed the planet was destroyed and we were placed in a simulated world. The thing I thought was most interesting though, is that whoever this person was described reality as being like a set of Russian dolls, where there are worlds nestled within one another, or ‘simulations’ within ‘simulations’.

The original thread with links to the screenshots are here:

https://np.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/4yyz23/4chan_thread_scientist_at_cern_admits_it/?st=JOES304U&sh=a4729951

The idea of ‘simulations’ within ‘simulations’ is not something new. It has been a part of Eastern philosophy since the 3rd century. A quote by Alan Watts illustrates it perfectly:

“Imagine a multidimensional spider's web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops. And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image.”

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net

We could even say the idea of being in a ‘simulation’ goes back to Gnosticism.

But anyways, besides the Mayans, there were some other people who predicted 2012 would be the end. One of these people was Terrance McKenna. Well, he didn’t necessarily believe 2012 would be the end, but he predicted there would be some ‘reality-rearranging’ event. He made this prediction using his Timewave Zero formula, which supposedly mathematically ‘decodes’ the King Wen sequence of the I Ching into something that graphs the fractal patterns of history. The graph culminates in a singularity point of infinite complexity. To understand this concept better you can  imagine a tape wrapped up in a spiral like you find inside a VHS tape or cassette tape. Time goes round and round in smaller and smaller loops until eventually, time runs out.

Is there another meaning to ‘the end of time’?

Preston B. Nichols, a supposed whistleblower who wrote books detailing time travel experiments at the Montauk Air Force Base, claimed that they were never able to time travel past 2012 because they could find no tangible future beyond it. According to him there was a very abrupt wall there, with nothing on the other side. Whether he’s a crackpot or not, what I find interesting is he did this interview in 2014. Like it’s just a strange thing to say considering you’ve already made it past that date, right? Also here’s a fun fact: Stranger Things and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are both loosely based on those experiments.

There’s also a theory floating around that we’ve reached the end of history. The ‘end of history’ is a philosophical idea that has been talked about by such notable figures as Hegel, Marx, and most recently Francis Fukuyama. At the ‘end of history’ events still happen, but humanity has reached the end of it’s sociocultural evolution. This theory has nothing to do with time travel or simulations, but rather, the stagnation of human progress. I just find it fitting that people think this is happening. It kind of fits the dream-like purgatory theme. It’s this theory I find most when trying to research the topic of the world having already ended.

Now if you think in terms of 4D, or beyond linear time, we can say that the universe has already ended. The moment it began the end was set in stone. Perhaps the universe is in a constant cycle of expanding and contracting and our souls are just taking a ride on the Cosmic Ferris Wheel.

However, whether we are in another reality or not, I think we’ve always been right where we’re supposed to be. I believe the only real place is HERE and the only true moment is NOW. Home is where the heart is and it is our PRESENT thought of our memories that make them real. For all we know, the universe could have been created this morning along with all our fake histories. Like the dude from CERN said, it doesn’t matter whether it’s real or not, what matters is our experience. So this is nothing to be afraid of. If anything, the powers that be are afraid of us.

If our universe was indeed destroyed, I like to think of it as analogous to a flower growing from the nutrients left over by the remains of another.

I know I don’t have much new information to add on this theory, but considering everything I had read before is gone, I really think the conversation needs to be opened up again. If anyone has more information on this please post it.

EDIT: If anyone is familiar with The Outer Light on YouTube, he made a video about this article and added some interesting insight. Here’s the link if anyone is interested:
