>eating meat is murder Is killing animals really fundamentally bad? I mean, animals die anyway.

Yes, it is fundamentally bad to breed sentient beings into existence just so that we can kill them. Especially when we are killing them for something as trivial and unnecessary as a flavour preference. It's murder to take the life of someone who wants to continue living, especially when it is completely unnecessary. Lots of people ""don't do anything in their life"" or even do bad things that harm others, but that is not a justification for killing them. The animals that are bred into existence and kept in captivity until they are slaughtered as adolescents wouldn't exist in the wild in the first place.

Their lifespan is still significantly reduced. Also if you were held prisoner and killed at 21 would it be a consolation to know you lived an okay life?

> I am against industrial farms with inhumane storing conditions, but there is nothing wrong with traditional outdoor farms.

And guess what is a significantly small minority of the meat industry. That's right, small outdoor farms.

> Is killing animals really fundamentally bad? I mean, animals die anyway. And they don't do anything with their lives, so their dying sooner doesn't really change anything. If you kill a human, you kill him before he's done all the things he'll do in his life, but animals don't do anything in their life, so what difference does it make?

What do you do? Reddit all day? Maybe watch movies, hang out with friends. You might not do anything significant with your life but im still not going to kill you because of it

>but there is no environmental reason to stop eating meat entirely

Simply put eating plants is more sustainable. It requires less water, less space, and produces more with less. The kicker here is that people tend to forget you need to feed those farm animals their whole lives. What do you think they are eating?

As an environmentalist that's what did it for me. I felt like I was half-assing it as a vegetarian.","2016-07-10 21:02:02","7","DustbinK","1747868172.124647","our planet is dying","manual"
"d577jwv","t3_4s74hi","4s74hi","vegan","unknown","Why would want to intentionally kill another sentient being for something so trivial? Those farms that you speak of is the incredibly small minority, and even so, the animals lives are cut short and they are still exploited for their bodies. At the end of the day, killing, torturing, and raping these animals isn't nice. And all these laws, that segregates the worth of lives between humans, cows, chickens, fish, pigs, cats, and dogs are arbitrary. All that matters is that sentient beings that have a will to live out their lives are being unnecessarily exploited. And animals don't do anything with their lives? What standard are you comparing them to? Humans? Most animals, want to live with their packs, eat, have children, raise their young. That's important to them. What do you do? What importance do you contribute to the world? That's a serious question, because it sounds like you're insinuating that if it isn't substantial, you should be killed. If you do not agree with the ethical side of veganism—if you do not the agree that the empathy should be extended to all who are sentient, then i do not see the point of even discussing this. Why should you 100% give up meat? Because killing, sexually exploiting, and torturing others is wrong. Don't agree? Then move on with your with because obviously what ever we say will not impact you in the slightest. We cannot teach you empathy and ethics if you don't want it.","2016-07-10 23:18:25","5","TevinOtter","1747868172.128257","our planet is dying","manual"

yes it does. even on ""happy"" farms.

I don't see any problem with killing out of necessity. I do see a problem with taking a life when you don't have to.

they sure do have a strong will to continue ""not doing anything""","2016-07-10 20:40:00","3","arabchic","1747868172.135387","our planet is dying","manual"

The real question that you should be asking yourself is, do you value your life? Sincerely? If the answer is yes then it reasons to suggest that you care about the lives of others as well- you merely believe in selfishness, which means that you are neglecting the values that we all share- your desire to be free, your desire to live, and the inherent values love and beauty.","2016-07-10 23:06:37","2","Azihayya","1747868172.140873","our planet is dying","manual"

Many humans meet this criteria as well. Humans are going to die anyway. Some humans don't do anything with their lives. Why is it not okay to kill these humans?

>If you kill a human, you kill him before he's done all the things he'll do in his life

Is it okay to murder an elderly human that has accomplished everything they've wanted to do in life? I'm not talking about voluntary euthnasia, I'm talking about the murder of a human that does not want to die.

>animals don't do anything in their life

On what basis?

>Also, you have no problem with animals dying in the wilderness

There's a practical limitation to how much suffering and death we can prevent. We're not going to be able to stop suffering in the wild, but we can definitely do what we can to reduce the suffering that is of our own making.

>If killing humans was allowed, society would collapse. Everyone would just grab weapons and kill their neighbours. Therefore, killing humans is called murder and is forbidden.
