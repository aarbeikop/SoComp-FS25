"5usngc","futurology","unknown","[AMA] I'm Nikola Danaylov of SingularityWeblog.com and Singularity.FM here to discuss ""Conversations with the Future"" or anything else you'd like","For generations, humanity stared at the vastness of the oceans and wondered, “What if?”

Today, having explored the curves of the Earth, we now stare at endless stars and wonder, “What if?”

Our technology has brought us to the make-or-break moment in human history. We can either grow complacent, and go extinct like the dinosaurs, or spread throughout the cosmos, as Carl Sagan dreamed of.

What if your toothbrush becomes smarter than you? What happens to your business, your country, your planet and yourself? What if your car doesn’t need a driver anymore? What if we don’t need to age and die? What if machines are smarter than us? What if, instead of fear of the future – you see opportunity, instead of an end – you see a beginning, instead of loss – you see profit, and instead of death – you see life?

For many years I've has been interviewing the future and motivating people all over the world to embrace rather than fear it. ""Conversations with the Future"" was born from those interviews and my unceasing need to explore ""What If"" with some of the most forward-thinking visionaries. 

I'm a Keynote Speaker, Futurist, Strategic Adviser, popular Blogger and Podcaster. I've spoken at many public events on topics ranging from technology, transhumanism and artificial intelligence to new media, blogging and podcasting. My Singularity 1on1 interviews have had 4.2 million views and have been featured on some of the biggest media and TV networks, which is why Professor Roman Yampolskiy has called me the 'Larry King' of the Singularity. 

I'll be here to chat live at 1300 EST on Sunday the 19th, and I'm opening up the AMA for some pre-discussion first - I'm looking forward to talking to you r/futurology!
