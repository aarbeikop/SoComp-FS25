"30jbk4","AskReddit","unknown","Why are we on this planet and what makes us different? (Meaning of life)","My friend and i were talking the other day about how small our individual lives are compared to the who universe and beyond. We are from the USA and we were saying how small we are to our town, how small our town is to our state, how small our state is to our country, how small our country is to continent, and how small our continent is to the world. Then we thought how small the earth is compared to our solar system and how small our system is to the galaxy. Then how many galaxies there are. What is our purpose. We will die one day and leave a lasting mark on a few people for a generation. But in 500 years only a handful of people will be remembered from our time on this planet. What are your thoughts to the meaning of life?","2015-03-27 21:29:42","3","31","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/30jbk4/why_are_we_on_this_planet_and_what_makes_us/","True","illinoiszombie","1747839160.659671","our planet is dying","manual"
"2xyjf4","AskReddit","unknown","Reincarnation - what happens when more people are dying than the amount of people being born?","For those that assume reincarnation is real, we assume that when we die we will be reborn into another human. Subconsciously I think we assume this because the birth rate is always higher than the death rate of humans. What happens if this is ever reversed? If more people die than people are born, do we have to wait in some sort of limbo until there is a body available that we can be born into? Do we instead get re-born into other animals or organisms? Does our spiritual energy move to another intelligent life form on another planet?
