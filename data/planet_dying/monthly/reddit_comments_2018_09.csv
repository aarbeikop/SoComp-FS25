Sometimes they seem like they're starting to listen and get it, but they often slide back into ""Bacon tho. Meat is good for you"" mode :/","2018-09-23 16:49:09","12","VeggiesForThought","1747915445.354614","our planet is dying","manual"

"e6shxi3","t3_9jkgik","9jkgik","vegan","unknown","I'm not saying my mechanisms are healthy, they may not sound like the right thing to do and they may not even work for you. I'm just telling you what I do

1. Acknowledge my ethical superiority **internally.** To me there is no harm in believing I am better than someone who is still contributing to abuse but I don't let it manifest externally, except towards people who deserve it (people will find it off-putting) but that too is completely up to you. 
2. Pick your battles, create small sets of problems which are solvable. I am focusing on a couple of people who expressed the desire to turn vegan because they didn't want to contribute to cruelty. If you aren't good at activism then focus on implementing a completely vegan household, help your parent / partner etc.
3. Get a hobby which makes you happy. I started powerlifting a couple of months ago and found that a whole foods plant based diet helps me recover faster than my meat eating gym buddies. Cooking could be another possible hobby. 
4. Get a group of like minded people to chill with. I am fortunate enough to have a couple of people by my side who are vegan.

"e6slaq7","t3_9jkgik","9jkgik","vegan","unknown","I went through a bit of a grieving process for the state of humanity when I first went vegan. There's actually a name for the feeling of being surrounded by people who have at least a slight hint of the horrors of carnism and simply don't care. Like others have said- don't lash out, it's ineffective and pushes people away. One thing I have done is focus on self care, and narrowing my vision. I don't think about animal rights on a global scale, it crushes me. I think about the positive message I try to send, and the way my family and friends are starting to see my points!
