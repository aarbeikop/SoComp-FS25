"89gumg","environment","emotional","The hard road ahead: What happens in the coming years of this planet...","This is what I see going forward. Let me know what you think.

Polar sea ice gone by 2020 to 2025. I don’t think a blue water Arctic is the end. It will be a harbinger. With the loss of the albedo effect from sea ice, temperature rises will be more stark. Frozen carbon and methane trapped in shallow Arctic seabeds and Arctic region permafrost - already bubbling and off-gassing from tens of thousands of sites - will see dramatic increases release into the atmosphere. There is double the greenhouse gasses trapped in the Arctic. The polar vortex will become even more destabilized and may break down. Major weather extremes will pick up frequency, devastating infrastructure and agriculture.

Our growing hungry and desperate populations - estimated to hit 10 billion by 2050 - will accelerate deforestation, habitat destruction, poaching and encroaching. They have to, because the Earth is losing arable land to salinization (from irrigation, sea level rises and storm surges), water erosion, depletion of fertility, windblown topsoil loss exacerbated by tilling, etc. Global meat consumption continues to rise, thanks to emerging nations’ prosperity, requiring even more fields to be cleared to grow food for livestock. (Sorry, vegans, hope doesn’t change billions of diets overnight. Your best efforts and comments, videos, books, presentations, graphic images of factory farming, etc. over the past several decades have not slowed consumption).

Greenland’s already “faster than expected” melt will accelerate even more dramatically once a blue water Arctic becomes reality, as sea water there heats up. World sea levels will see truly noticeable rises from that. The giant kilometer-thick ice of Antarctica will still be there. Though that, too, will be picking up calving and melting acceleration. It may take a few decades or more for Antarctica’s ice to go, but serious sea level rises will mean tens of thousands of human cities (including garbage dumps and hundreds of nuclear power plants) will be inundated, especially by king tides and storm surges. (You will not want to be living near the ocean in a few years’ time.)

Even as that occurs, the cumulative acidification and warming of the oceans will pick up. Already, plankton, mollusks, coral, etc. and other creatures at the base are stressed and experiencing difficulties, as per this article. The bottom of the food chain and oxygen generation (ocean phytoplankton generate half the oxygen on this planet) will fall out - even as fleets of desperate trawlers and millions of fishermen seek to pillage even more from collapsed stocks.

Animals are disappearing in palpable numbers. To support humanity’s increase from 4 billion to almost 7.6 billion (including our ecological footprint), over half of all animals (terrestrial and marine) had to die. Yet the rates of deforestation and desertification have increased, not decreased. Species are disappearing in at a frenzied pace. Overall ecological and environmental collapse has become really noticeable lately. It will be even more noticeable going forward. Rhinos, elephants, giraffes, orangutans, tigers, etc. will be gone from the wild.

Perhaps enough of us humans will realize our folly once we are no longer able to insulate ourselves from the consequences of our actions. By then, however, it will have been too little, too late...

When you think about it, we are on a massive ship with a small engine. It takes decades to get up to speed; we’ve had a few centuries. Even small course corrections take decades to begin, decades to implement, and decades to begin seeing real results. To make changes in time, we needed to have started decades ago: strict laws on extraction, production, consumption, reproduction, pollution, and disposition. None of it has happened. In fact, the bridge has ordered the ship’s engine room to increase power to the thrusters. The wheel is locked on course. Now is the time to come to terms. “[Iceberg, dead ahead!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdISamu_UPM)”","2018-04-03 18:25:20","5","0","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/89gumg/the_hard_road_ahead_what_happens_in_the_coming/","True","hillsfar","1747905836.9356532","our planet is dying","manual"
"8bji0e","green","lifestyle","Greenhouse gases are good lol","Not a troll post. I have a buddy on fb that posted this statement. Hes been annoying me a lot lately. So how would any of you argue this statement he put: (hes mad his indoor veggies are dying lol)

Explain to me how you plan to grow your fruits and vegetables with oxygen when you take all the carbon away.

Green house gases (GHG) are a very important and crucially staple part of the natural balance of the planet.
Everybody saying GHG's are bad, are misinformed.

Change my mind!

Why do I make this argument? Think about it... We're trying to stop carbon emissions entirely on a whole with our ""go green"" initiatives. Now I personally don't even think this is even possible even using the go green plans, because the pollution to manufacture renewable fuel capture tools and batteries are super harmful.","2018-04-11 18:43:48","3","1","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/8bji0e/greenhouse_gases_are_good_lol/","True","onikafei","1747906322.327588","our planet is dying","manual"
"8dxn6y","NoStupidQuestions","unknown","Why can't we take water from the ocean and use it in areas where there are droughts?","I'm aware that water in the ocean has a massive salt concentration, but from my very limited knowledge of water purification I also know that removing salt from water would be extremely easy. Our planet is literally covered in water, so the fact that on the few areas of land there are people who are dying of thirst makes no sense to me. Why has no one put money into just using ocean water as a source of drinking water after some sort of purification process?

"8fjiyj","conspiracy","unknown","Yeah so, I am finally realizing how fucking controlled our species has been. Color has been used to trap us. Toxins used to starve us. Hours and wages used to enslave us. Our species has been enslaved and I finally realize this, but no longer fear it. The things we used to need are now killing us.","First, let me say, that I have not slept the past 2 days and am not even on drugs. I just ate a little kief, instead of burning it. Alright so let's start.

Honestly, it's been a pretty big cluster fuck so I'll just keep it simple instead.

Our human species has been purposely trapped in a low state of fear and consciousness. While ""satan"" in the sense of some ""mega demon"" does not exist, there are lower frequencies of energy that can effect us, rob us, bring us down, drag us down, and trap us in a state of fear which therefore makes us create our reality around us, from a state of fear.

Think about it.

Everywhere around you, you are told, screamed at, pushed, punched, torn up, thrown away, and told you are useless. Why do you allow this to happen to you! Stand up! Stand UP WITH ME! I PUT IN MY TWO WEEKS AT WORK THIS WEEK AND HAVE NOT SLEPT SINCE. I FEEL ALIVE. I FEEL ENERGETIC. I FEEL SO FUCKING LIGHT AND FLUFFY.

I will not stop and the fear will not drag me back into this stupid RAT RACE we have been supporting.

I can support myself.

You know what I am going to do?

I am going to clean the earth, and live by doing that.

If leeches, parasites, negative energy, can drain us of our life force and rape and pillage this planet and our bodies in the name of greed, selfishness, etc and grow and grow and continue to grow until this whole planet is consumed and there is NO FUCKING MONEY LEFT BECAUSE ALL RESOURCES WILL BE GONE JESUS FUCK WAKE THE HELL UP. TECHNOLOGY IS SUPPRESSED. MEDICAL HEALTH AND FREEDOM IS SUPPRESSED. SOCIETAL AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS ARE SUPPRESSED IN THE NAME OF PROFITS, POWER, CONTROL, DIVISION, FUCK WHY DID WE DO THIS TO OURSELVES.

Guess what though?

It's changing. And it starts with one. Because we are all one. So if you make the conscious choice to stop taking abuse and take your power back, everyone around you will see what you're doing, see your power, see your confidence, and ultimately SEE YOUR LIGHT LIFE FORCE.

CLAIM YOUR LIFE, CLAIM YOUR POWER, CLAIM OUR PLANET EARTH FOR THE HUMAN BEING THAT DESERVES TO LIVE HERE ON THIS GORGEOUS PLANET!

I fucking hate typing in caps lock BUT PLEASE JUST LISTEN. PLEASE.

DO NOT ABANDON YOUR BROTHERS. YOUR SISTERS. WE ARE ALL ONE, HELP EACH OTHER, DON'T HURT EACH OTHER. GROW. LOVE. EVOLVE. STOP HOARDING. STOP HIDING. STOP RUNNING. SHARE. OPEN. INVITE. WELCOME. IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY LIVE OTHERWISE YOU WILL DESTROY THIS GORGEOUS PLANET FOR THE THIRD TIME.

lemuria and atlantis was enough, and whoever else and whatever societies had to die and collapse and break down. It is time we make this leap as a species once and for all AND OWN IT. And hold each others hands, and not mock that, or attack it. That is weakness. Light is strength. Light is power. Love is love. Love is power. Reclaim that power and stop having a leech such that power out of you.

Reclaim it, grow, heal, AND FIX YOUR DIET. Even our food is controlled, and AVOID CORPORATIONS. AVOID CORPORATE ""CHAIN LADDERS"" AND ""CHAINS OF COMMAND"" You are your own command. Stop waiting for someone above you to tell you what to do.

Do it yourself.

AND LIVE

AND LOVE

AND BE

This is how we were meant to be.

Come on guys, COME THE FUCK ON. WE CAN DO THIS","2018-04-28 12:15:47","243","196","0.71","https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8fjiyj/yeah_so_i_am_finally_realizing_how_fucking/","True","Loud_Volume","1747907159.874493","our planet is dying","manual"
