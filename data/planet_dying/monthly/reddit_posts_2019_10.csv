"dmsjz3","collapse","skeptical","Some of the ways climate change will kill you [actual effort post].","Bear in mind that, according to UN estimates, we're currently on track for 4.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100:

**Heat Death** \- In 2003, a heat wave killed around 35,000 people in Europe, around 2,000 people died per day. After 4 degrees of warming those kinds of death-inducing temperatures will be a normal summer rather than a heat wave. At 5 degrees large parts of the world will become literally uninhabitable to humans and at 6 degrees working in the summer would be pretty much impossible for much of the US, with New York City being hotter than present-day Bahrain and the temperatures in places like Bahrain would be inhospitable. After 7 degrees of warming, temperatures around the equator would cook you to death in a matter of hours. If we ever reach 11 degrees then half of the world's population would die from heat alone. We will still have heatwaves alongside these hotter summers but they will be far hotter and therefore far deadlier as we are already seeing in instances like the 2010 heat wave in Russia which killed 55,000 people, 700 people per day died in Moscow alone.

**Hunger** \- For cereal crops, every 1 degree of warming leads to a 10% decrease in yields, meaning that if we experience a 5 degree warming by 2100 we may have 50% less grain to feed a 50% larger global population (grain currently makes up 40% of the human diet). This would also reduce the amount of meat we can produce since it takes 8 pounds of grain to produce a pound of hamburger meat. As well as the increases in heat, the increasing prevalence of droughts should also be considered. At just 2 degrees of warming, the Mediterranean and much of India will experience frequent droughts, straining global food supply. At 2.5 degrees, thanks mostly to drought, the world could enter a global food deficit needing more calories than the planet can produce. At 3 degrees, there would be further drought in Central America, Pakistan, the western United States, and Australia. And:

>By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American Dust Bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China. None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, would be reliable sources going forward.

**Drowning** \- On our current course we can expect between 4 and 8 feet of sea level rise by 2100. Or, if we keep to 2 degree of warming (unlikely) we could still conceivably reach a 6 feet rise. These rises would force hundreds of millions of people out of their homes as coastal cities all over the world are submerged.

**Wildfires** \- We are already seeing wildfires worsen - those in the US burn twice as much land as they did in 1970 (this could double again by 2050, and quadruple with every further degree of warming) and the wildfire season has grown by two and a half months. Recent examples include the 2018 Woolsey Fire, which caused 170,000 people to be evacuated, and the even worse Camp Fire which burned a whole town so quickly that the 50,000 evacuees ""found themselves sprinting past exploding cars, their sneakers melting to the asphalt as they ran"". Another fire in Colorado produced ""a volcano-like 300-foot eruption of flames"" now known as a ""fire tsunami"". Things are worsening outside of the US too. In 2017, fires in Greenland burned 10 times more than previously, and in 2018 fires broke out in Sweden, Finland, and Russia - the smoke from the Siberian fires reaching all the way to the US. The fires in Greece in 2018 killed 99 and ""At one resort, dozens of guests tried to escape the flames by descending a narrow stone staircase into the Aegean, only to be engulfed along the way, dying literally in each other’s arms"" whilst others burnt alive after becoming [trapped in their cars](https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/7/25/8a96b0d8c09b4ff98a757e33462cea03_8.jpg).

**Natural Disasters** \- 2017 saw the ""once in 500,000 years"" rainfall of hurricane Harvey drop a million gallons of water for every person in Texas on Houston, Hurricane Maria which killed at least 3,000 and ruined the lives of many more, the flood in South Asia that forced 45 million people from their homes, and the already mentioned wildfires. 2018 got even worse with a record-breaking global heatwave, 6 hurricanes and tropical storms appearing all at once - including Typhoon Mangkhut that killed 100 and Hurricane Florence that killed 50 and doubled the average annual rainfall in California. After 4 degrees of warming, these natural disasters will just be ""weather"", we will have to invent new categories to describe hurricanes, the ability for warmer air to hold more moisture will result in ""rain bombs"" like the one that hit Hawaii in 2018 with 50 inches of rain in 24 hours, tornadoes will leave longer and wider trails of destruction, hail rocks will quadruple in size. We are already experiencing 40% more intense rainstorms than in the 1950s, in some areas its as high as 71%.

**Water** \- Already, as many as 2.1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water, and 4.5 billion do not have access to safely managed water for sanitation. Half of the world's population are also reliant on the seasonal melt of glaciers for their water supply. At 2 degrees of warming the Himalayas will lose 40% of their ice by 2100 resulting in widespread water shortages, similar outcomes are expected in places like Peru and California that also rely on Glaciers. At 4 degrees the Alps will lose 70% of their snow by 2100. On our current course, by 2020 250 million more Africans could face water shortages, by 2050 that number could be 1 billion in Asia alone and freshwater supplies for cities all over the world could decline by two thirds. The increasing temperatures could also make the remaining drinking water unsafe by becoming breeding grounds for warm-water-friendly bacteria. This happened in 2007 with Lake Tai on which 2 million people were dependant. Likewise, the heating of Lake Tanganyika in East Africa devastated the fishing stocks eaten by millions of people.

**Unbreathable Air** \- Already 10,000 people die EVERY DAY from air pollution. The Air Quality Index categories the risks of air pollution on a numerical scale, the index tops out at the 301–500 range, warning of “serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly” and “serious risk of respiratory effects in the general population”; at that level, “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” In 2013, the Chinese ""airpocalypse"" reached 993 in the index and pollution killed 1.37 million people in China that year. In California in 2017, wildfires caused air pollution to reach 486 on the index, whilst in Delhi its at an index of 999 and breathing the air is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes each day. By 2090 2 billion people will be breathing air classed as unsafe.

**Plague** \- There are diseases trapped inside arctic ice that have not circulated in the air for for thousands or millions of years, as this ice melts these diseases may be reanimated. This has already happened several times: ""a 32,000-year-old “extremophile” bacteria revived in 2005, an 8-million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007, a 3.5-million-year-old one a Russian scientist self-injected, out of curiosity, just to see what would happen."" (Lol). Researchers have also discovered remnants of Spanish Flu (infected 500 million and killed 50 million in 1918) and suspect there may be remnants of smallpox, bubonic plague, and other diseases - many of which our immune systems will have no idea how to fight. As the planet warms we will also likely see the spread of diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, and zika to new places since insects like mosquitoes will be able to inhabit more and more areas.

**Bacteria -** I think this outcome of global warming is by far the most horrifying. Inside each of us there are bacteria of which about 99% is unkown to science, some of this bacteria we are reliant upon to survive, others may be completely benign. However, as temperatures rise, there is the possibility that the bacteria may be rewired, diminished or killed off entirely. Not only could this mean that those little bois inside us we rely on to survive are killed off or mutate and behave differently, but it also means that the other bacteria just chilling in there mutates into something new with fatal outcomes. This isn't just something that could happen in theory, it has already happened in some other species. The Saiga ([a kind of antelope that looks like a moose fucked a goat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Saiga_antelope_at_the_Stepnoi_Sanctuary.jpg)) had a bacteria living in its tonsils that posed no danger to it in any way. Then, during a heatwave in May 2015, the bacteria mutated and emigrated to the Saiga's bloodstream and then to its liver, kidneys, and spleen. This resulted in a 100% fatality rate, 120,000 dead Saigas, and the Saiga becoming extinct in some countries. Its entirely possible that humans may experience a similar thing.

**Economic Collapse** \- On our current path, it is estimated that 100 million people will be dragged into extreme poverty over the next decade alone. Not to mention the impacts the stuff mentioned above will have. (Unless you listen to Stevie Pinker, obviously).

**Climate Conflict** \- Each half-degree of warming increases the likelihood of armed conflict by 10-20% - that's 80-160% more war if we reach 4 degrees of warming and 40-80% more even if we stick to the 2 degrees of the Paris agreement. In Africa alone rising temperatures are expected to lead to \~400,000 more combat deaths by just 2030.

"dee8kv","TrueOffMyChest","unknown","The existential unknown is utterly terrifying, but we're in it together","Either a god exists and he's made everything happen, or a god doesn't exist and he's made nothing happen. It's one or the other. I don't see a middleground, unless it's something like ""God created us, got bored and just kinda left us here"".

The only way to 'find out the truth' is to die, and if it turns out there is no afterlife, there would be no brain/soul left to comprehend that, completely nullifying the act of truth-seeking. It's a Catch-22 that's so catchy, Joseph Heller would even call it a Catch-23.

At least in a Catch-22 situation, the factors that make the problem what it is are all laid out in plain sight. This ""Catch-23"" is a step higher than that - we're incapable of knowing just how many forces are at work here to even begin to understand the nature of everything that ever was.

How are we even alive to begin with? ""Chemical reactions"" are the obvious answer, but who (or what) created those chemical reactions? The Big Bang?

Did God create the big bang, or was God created in the big bang? Does God even exist to have been involved with the big bang?

This is all very base level /r/im14andthisisdeep stuff everyone asks themselves at least once in life, but the simple fact that we have no idea where we actually came from and have to fear death based on the notion that we don't know what's on the other side frustrates the piss out of me.

Like, where do people go when they die? The common consensus seems to be that there's no afterlife, but that common consensus was reached by living beings.

As for people who have died for 6 minutes and come back, well, some saw angels, some saw nothing. We're right back to square 1. Great.

The only solace I can find in hearing those kinds of experiences is that death is overwhelmingly peaceful... y'know, once you get past the whole 'dying' part. Whatever created the universe didn't make death inherently unbearable.

Sure, it probably hurts to die, but the common consensus from people who have died and come back is that it was like a restful sleep, and they were so relaxed by it that making an effort to return themselves to living again was like trying to get out of bed at 7 in the morning when you just want to sleep.

Is that relaxed sensation God preparing to remove you from your body, or is it just the call of the void, brought to you by the laws of physics?

When you're almost dead, you're likely holding very still, and objects at rest stay at rest, and objects in motion stay in motion.

So of course a little push to will yourself back to life from the brink of death is required to keep living. If you don't do that, if you don't will yourself back from the brink of death with a little push from your will to live, you'll just remain at rest.

But who, hypothetically, created those laws of physics? God, I guess, so even if he isn't spiritually cradling your soul in your final moments, he could still very well be behind that relaxed death feeling in that he created the universe in which the ""objects at rest stay at rest and objects in motion stay in motion"" rule exists.

Do you see how maddeningly circular it is to try and determine how many things God could possibly be behind? Like he's either behind all of it or none of it, and that's assuming he even exists to begin with.

The only thing scarier than not knowing is knowing. If God appeared before you and said ""I created you lol"", would you even trust your senses at that point? Maybe you're just hallucinating his great reveal. How could he prove himself beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's telling the truth? Why would he in the first place?

The thing is, all of these questions are pointless since we'll never be able to answer them. But I'm not really looking for an answer here - all of you are (probably) as mortal and in-the-existential-dark as I am.

It's honestly just fascinating that we exist at all. How we got here or what we're here for doesn't matter if we're in it together by default.

I don't know at what point in my life all of this occurred to me, but when I was a kid I was never concerned with any of this. Little three-year-old me just assumed there was a god and that he was looking out for everyone.

The thing is, I've gotten older, accrued more experience and I still don't think it's reasonable to completely rule out that a god exists. We just don't know. Anyone who insists they do is completely full of shit since they'd have undeniable proof if they did.

These realizations have made me a lot nicer to people in general - if we only have one shot at life, why waste it on pointless grudges 'n squabbles? We're basically *all* on the same team, we were thrown into the world without a say in the matter, so the perspective that this sort of ego-death gives really shines a light on literally everything.

Here comes the meta part of the post. I've ranted about a lot of stupid, inconsequential shit on this subreddit, but honestly a lot of it comes from not knowing/understanding the thing I'm ranting about.

Here, though? We're all in the same boat. Everyone lives, and everyone dies not knowing what comes next. It's absolutely horrifying that we live in a world like this with so much death and war, but in this moment in time, we have the means to at least bitch to each other about it.

This whole entire reality isn't exactly the nicest, but the thing is that we're in it together and mostly willing to not only cooperate, but make our lives better for ourselves and each other.

Maybe I'm just young and I haven't lived long enough to adopt a jaded worldview yet, but there's something really endearing about the fact that it's just us humans, the world and nothing else. There's no visible sky-entity flipping a coin to decide whether to fuck with our day.

Everything happens for a reason. If your car breaks down, that wasn't a randomly-generated event or a glitch in real life, you just have to maintain your vehicle better.

That's why knowledge is so important, being able to understand why things happen the way they do is a front-door key to changing fate. If you know nothing about a car, how could you maintain it? If you end up having kids and don't know what a ""spark plug"" is, how are you going to make sure their cars won't break down when they're old enough to drive?

Knowing things helps not only you, but people you care about. If God were in the picture, he could completely override your well-maintained car and make it break down by ethereal tampering.

By knowing things, you effectively become a god yourself since you have more means to change the world around you.

But if you *really* want to change things, you need tangible things like money and resources. Folding your hands, closing your eyes and saying your hopes out loud won't do anything, but God (as he's described) is kind of a wild card, so maybe it's better that he stays out of the picture if he does exist.

I understand how all over the place this post is, but there's no roadmap to talking about life itself. I think what I'm trying to say is that we're all gods to an extent, we have the power to change things, for better or worse. Who cares about what happens after we die if we're not gonna find out until then anyway? We've got a planet to live on, we can't spend every waking moment worrying about what might or might not happen.

"dghn2t","urbanplanning","unknown","Engineering Intentionally Terrible Transit: A Critique of Southeast Michigan’s 2020-2045 RTA proposal Pt. 1: How Bad is it?","# Disclaimer:

*This is part one of a three part series analyzing a local transit proposal that is likely to hit ballot boxes next year in my local area. This entry looks at the past history of transit in Southeast Michigan and compares it to the scope and scale of the Southeast Michigan Regional Transit Authority’s proposed “2045 vision” plan. My next entry will deal with what improvements can be made in order to avoid defeat at the ballot box, and the final entry will concern what types of political reforms would need to happen in order to assure the speedy and efficient delivery of a world class regional transit system to the Detroit Metro Area, as well as theorize about the future development of cities in general.*

Comprehensive regional transit has been at the tip of every single person’s tongue in the Detroit Metro Area and Greater Southeast Michigan region for decades now, which makes perfect sense once you consider the fact that [a 2019 WalletHub study ranked Detroit and its surrounding areas as literally the worst place to own a car in the entire nation](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-to-drive-in/13964/) due to the absolutely insane cost of insurance, car maintenance, and the overall condition of transportation infrastructure in the state of Michigan (Fun Fact: our roads are so trash that, in 2018 we elected a governor whose main platform was literally just [“We need to fix the damn roads”](http://youtube.com/watch?v=mjVJ5XoYKEA) and added a threat of vowing to completely veto any budget passed by the state legislature that didn’t include any long-term road funding. This promise which, unsurprising to anyone who has a passing curiosity in state politics, [was waffled on immediately after she got into office](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/09/09/whitmer-breaks-pledge-to-fix-the-damn-roads-under-new-budget)).

There’s something interesting about our demoralizing current lack of transit though: it didn’t always use to be like this. At its height in 1910, Michigan possessed over nine thousand miles of freight and regional/commuter rail, which is enough rail mileage to build a rail route from Detroit to the northernmost city in Michigan’s lower peninsula (Mackinaw City) thirty five times or, a rail line from NYC’s Grand Central Terminal to Michigan Central Station eighteen times. For reference, these cities are about 252 and 484 miles apart from Detroit respectively, [here’s a timeline compiled by the Michigan Department of Transit documenting the rise and fall of Michigan’s railways](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdot/Michigan_Railroad_History_506899_7.pdf) read it. It’s eye opening. Even in decades of stagnation and decline in the seventies and eighties, it was possible to catch [commuter trains from downtown Detroit to Jackson, Michigan and through to Chicago to the west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Executive) and [from the Renaissance Center on Detroit’s riverfront up to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac in the north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEMTA_Commuter_Rail).

So, just how in the hell does a major American city and a heavily developed state/region  allow it’s public infrastructure to deteriorate as drastically as it did? If you want the short, snarky yet completely true left-urbanist answer: It was because of capitalism, aduhh. If you a longer, more “objective” answer (that still relates to capitalism, but phrased in a way that allows people who are fans of “market urbanism” to not get too worked up):[ it happened for all the same reasons that the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WORIrHpC8M), private companies that live and die by their ability to endlessly expand their profits and have a vested interest in maintaining/expanding their business models will always seek to co-opt and undermine public goods if they threaten to compete with or undermine those same profits and business interests. It was true in 1920, and if left unchanged by the public it will remain the truth into 2020.

So, you may be thinking this post is informative so far and all. But, how does all of this relate to a transit proposal? Simply put, as a lifelong resident of this region, when I look at this proposal, which at first glance seems like one of the most ambitious transit plans this region’s history, is not up to snuff once you dive deeper into the details of all of the aspects that make up this proposal, nor does it learn from the state’s past mistakes of allowing privatization to take root within public assets, and that isn’t even nearly half of it. The RTA’s projections of job opportunities and lifestyles for the region’s young people like myself are hilariously bleak. It makes absolutely no effort to address or confront the fast approaching climate crisis that has to be tackled immediately if we want future generations to enjoy life on the only habitable planet that Humans have ever known. The RTA focuses on “connecting existing population and job centers” rather than striving to build and maintain new ones like the rail+property model that has been successfully deployed in cities across Asia. etc. Did I mention that it’s literally a giveaway to car and “mobility” companies? Yeah, well it’s that too.

Let’s take a dive into the proposal to see what specifically is so bad about it (trust me, there’s a lot, but I only wanna cover the big issues for the time being) [here’s a direct link to the proposal so you can read it and judge it’s merits for yourselves](http://www.rtamichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/8-2020.Mobility.Vision.Presentation.7.18.19.pdf)

# Bright predictions for a bullshit future

On the portion of the document that’s titled “The Region Today”, the RTA’s projections of population and job growth is a bit… iffy to say the least. Assuming that this transit plan is passed by voters next year, the RTA projects that the largest metro area in the state of Michigan will grow from 4.2 million to 4.5 million people, and the job market will grow from 2.5 million to 2.7 million jobs over the span of twenty years (2020-2045). If you extrapolate those figures to yearly growth percentages, they’re expecting a change of .012%/year and .008%/year respectively… If those figures don’t concern you, then I’d like to direct your attention to the bottom of the page where the RTA constructed a chart comparing the composition of the region’s population in 2015 to the projected composition of the region in 2045. If you want a lesson in how you can hide extremely unfavorable data in plain sight, look no further than this chart. While the senior population is projected to rise by a “mere” 7% and the youth population is projected to decline “only” 2% if you extrapolate this data to actual population figures, the estimated shift is absolutely jaw dropping: The senior population is expected to rise by 990,000 people while the youth population is expected to drop by 84,000 people.. To put that youth figure into proper context, [between the years of 2008 and 2012 the entire state of Michigan lost 17,208 young people with bachelor’s degrees per year](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2019/03/michigan-still-fights-brain-drain-although-outlook-has-improved.html), that 84k loss figure for the Detroit area is 22% larger than the losses for those four years combined.. Keep in mind that these are likely the “most optimistic” numbers that the RTA are projecting. Michigan has been a struggling state for a long time.

# A lack of care for the climate

The word “electric” is only used twice within a twenty eight page document describing a major municipal transit proposal, and only used when referring to the “aspirational goals”.... That’s a major problem. [The vast majority of climate scientists agree that if action isn’t taken within 12-11 years,  Earth will experience irreversible warming the likes of which this planet has never seen](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/27082019/12-years-climate-change-explained-ipcc-science-solutions). The fact that there aren’t any aggressive goals or benchmarks in place to meet tackle an issue of monumental importance like climate change, (refusing even to reference the words “climate change” a single time in the whole document no less) and the blatant admission on “The Region Today” page at the beginning of the document that the transit proposal does not aim to reduce overall car usage in the DMA, or increase the total percentage of low car and car-free households over the twenty five year lifespan of this proposal should put doubts in anyone’s minds that the RTA takes its job as a provider of public transit seriously.

# Artificially restricted and rickety rail numbers

The main backbone of the concrete promises in this transit proposal rely heavily on expanded local bus services, the promise of BRT lines on the region’s major thoroughfares, and just one commuter rail line.. that’s it. [Extensive research has already been done about the social and physical benefits that people may enjoy by simply living near rail transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cjfTG8DbwA&t=72s). The RTA might have included a few more commuter rail lines, light rail to the airport, and a promise to expand the Qline (A public-private financed streetcar that runs through downtown Detroit which was constructed with the unwanted influence of the state’s richest man Dan Gilbert, which is why the streetcar is named after his company Quicken Loans. [He oversaw a series of boneheaded design changes that lead the streetcar to drastically underperform it’s projected ridership projections](https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/two-years-in-detroits-qline-falls-far-short-of-expectations/Content?oid=21552552)) in their “aspirational goals” but like a lot of things in this proposal, upon a closer look, the numbers just don’t seem to add up. In the “Rail” portion of the document, the RTA states that $135 million dollars is needed in order to establish the Ann Arbor-Detroit commuter rail line, but, when the RTA calculates the cost of expanding the commuter rail  north to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac and northwest to the suburb of Mount Clements, *plus* building a new streetcar line to the airport, *plus* an unspecified expansion of the Qline downtown, they estimate the cost to only be $181 million dollar more per year… what? That‘s the type of math that I do when I don’t feel like working on an assignment until I find myself awake at 11:00 pm with a 12 o’clock deadline to turn in a paper to my professor.. It makes no sense.

#Finally: Crazy cash for car and mobility companies

References to explicit privatization of formerly public transit services and “public private partnerships” are peppered through this document more vigorously than a Cajun gumbo dish. Knowing the history of transit in this city and state as well as I do, I am more than a little freaked out when I see passages like: *“the evaluation of underperforming routes regularly and pilot alternative forms of mobility (i.e. microtransit, public private partnerships service models, etc.) is an aspirational goal of ours”* and *“Expanding public/private pilot programs to evaluate new service models is something that we want to do in the near term”* (which can be found in the “local bus”  and “new mobility services” portions of the document respectively) take up prime real estate on a document regarding a long term transit proposal. If you want to deal with solid numbers, if you add up all of the near term/long term goals where some form of privatization or public-private partnerships are mentioned, for profit companies would have access to $1.31 billion public dollars by the proposal’s end in 2045 (this amounts to $52.4 million/year).

If that isn’t unpalletable enough, there’s ample evidence here that there were some closed door deals made between public and private officials. Take Michigan Central Station (MCS), which is Ford’s new Corktown campus, it makes a not-so-strange cameo appearance in this plan. [It was announced on June 11th of last year that they bought the long abandoned landmark from a local family of notorious slumlords named the Moroun’s](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2018/06/11/moroun-detroit-train-station-ford/689841002/), who then proceeded to wax poetic about Ford’s “commitment to the future of Detroit” and all that PR fluff. Then, [a story broke on April 3rd of this year suggesting that representatives from Ford Co. approached members of Detroit/Wayne county’s port authority, officials in the Detroit mayor’s office, Congresswoman Brenda Jones of Southfield, and “other regional and transit officials” asking them to conduct a feasibility study to see if passenger rail service could be restored at the site](https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/detroit-studies-restoring-passenger-trains-michigan-central-station). Now, it might seem like a completely innocent, altruistic act for Ford to do at first glance. Detroit and southeast Michigan haven’t had a true regional rail network since the early eighties. But, once you consider the fact that, after the process of buying MCS was all said and done, [Ford secured $104 million dollars in tax breaks from Detroit](http://freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/10/16/ford-michigan-central-station-tax/1651079002/), which is America’s largest impoverished city population and percentage wise and [got a further $207 million from the state of Michigan](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/john-gallagher/2018/11/27/detroit-train-station-ford-corktown/2127091002/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) which has been experiencing a cataclysmic teacher shortage in its urban and rural schools (which won’t be helped by the fact that there are stipulations in these tax breaks that allow Ford to have the value of their property frozen to “pre-improvement” levels for 12-15 years, and they are exempted from paying city property, corporate, and utility taxes for 30 years. To put this into context, I was born in 1997, I’ll be 53 years old by the time Ford is legally obligated to pay the full cost of their new property). Nevermind the fact that, literally a couple months after the deal was finalized,[ they laid off 800 local workers for “reorgination purposes”](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/05/20/state-taxpayers-gave-ford-240m-then-it-cut-800-local-jobs) ,  [they owed the federal government $78 million in unpaid taxes as of last year](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/02/28/gm-ford-rarely-pay-federal-taxes-tax-refunds/2985737002/), and even though they moved  into Corktown in a completely transparent bid to try and capitalize off yet to be discussed transit proposal as well as flex their muscles as a “mobility company”, [Ford discontinued their “Chariot” services that they piloted in major metro areas like New York and San Francisco in order to show investors that they could even be a “mobility company”](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/ford-is-shutting-down-chariot-shuttle-service/)... there’s a whole portion of the transit proposal dedicated to this type of business model, and local “leaders” in the area thought that it was a good idea to do this..

When wealth no longer matters, the ultra-rich need new techniques to barter with men's souls. A few of those techniques are life-extension technologies, ultra-advanced science, the ability to take drugs with no side effects (drug addiction de-Naturing peptide enzymes only for the elite). And then there's unlimited child sex with any girl you choose from a catalog of the most beautiful children in the world. A pedo can pick out any child he likes and they will be taken and never found again. That's where true child abduction began and has evolved into a huge enterprise.

You get the public to cry ""Get rid of guns!"" and then you the government step in and say ""We have heard you, you want no more guns, we shall take the guns as you have asked."" Meanwhile, that's the very thing you as dictator of a stupid mass of people wanted. You just tricked them into doing your bidding. Thanks, Congressman Beto"" O'Rourke.  Thanks so much.

Beginning in the 1950s, we already had the technology to broadcast imagery into the sky. The true state of technology is always 50-100-1000 years ahead of what is projected in society. The Germans were working with levitation in the 1940s. America was turning ships invisible, and sometimes teleporting them halfway across the world. The technology we know about is just the oldest cream of the crop. The newest stuff is always hidden and secret for at least 50 years while the majority is 100 to 1000 years in Advancement. So this whole UFO thing is total bullshit. There aren't any aliens or UFOs. They've been broadcasting these holograms in the sky and in the faces of astronauts for years. And then they tell the astronauts not to disclose any information. Most are disloyal to the country and loyal to the Military-Industrial Complex/Government, so they say nothing. But a few ""patriots"" who have our best interest at heart leak the information. Those are the ones the government loves because when they leak, it all seems so much more genuine. This is reverse psychology 101, folks. If they tried to tell us there were aliens and UFO's, we'd use science and reason to dispel every argument, we'd oppose them. For government knows that we the people see them as Father and Mother, and children always lie to their parents and try to prove their parents wrong (as a whole). Especially if there isn't trust there. The whole Public/Government relationship is one of distrust by its very nature. We want to believe them, but we often challenge them. It's natural. So they contrived the whole UFO/UAP dynamic in order to make us believe they were hiding something from us, which sells it even faster. The problem was this: The public is too powerful and too big, and that scared the Elite controllers. They need control. How do you control so many people at once? Fear. To unite the people in a common enemy, to get the people to turn to the government for a solution. The government wants to control. So the problem is fear. Fear the UFO/UAP, fear the aliens. Movies help with that a lot, they are also part of the psy-op.  This is known as the Messiah System in Hollywood. War of the Worlds scares us. Then we hear about alien artifacts all over the world. But the one movie that lifted the veil was ""The Matrix"" it revealed a deep truth the Elite didn't want us to know. We've all been here before, many times before. The whole entire world has been here before, 30,000 years ago before the ice age. It's the Atlantus mythos, the greatly advanced civilization that rose to power and was destroyed by arrogance. It's the human story that keeps repeating itself. The same corrupt elites keep building their own cache of knowledge and technology to help them stay ahead of the masses. Then society starts to fall apart as people lose their ability to love others. Then selfishness overcomes public trust, and the public caves in on itself, and then the government tries to destroy humanity in order to leave a small few behind to take possession of the entire Earth. But every single time they try this shit, it backfires, they die too. The reason Blockchain was implemented in 1975 within NC3 Nuclear Command and Control and Communications (NC3) is due to the fact that the first ICBMs from the 1950s to 1975 were vulnerable after being ⚡️ zapped by UFO/UAP in which would bring down Americas Nuclear Capabilities/silos. The UFO/UAP would then be chased away by Fighter Jets. The Presidents and Pentagon tired of these interference/shenanigans challenged the Military-Industrial Complex to put an end to this.

After the nukes go off a few humans survive and go underground or somewhere survivable, if barely, and the whole sordid thing starts over again. It's happened so many times before, and in a few cases, we got a lot further than we have today. In one cycle, we actually developed spaceships, and we traveled through the galaxy, and we set up bases on the moon and inhabited Mars. [https://www.reaganfoundation.org/ronald-reagan/white-house-diaries/diary-entry-06111985/](https://www.reaganfoundation.org/ronald-reagan/white-house-diaries/diary-entry-06111985/)

There is a lot of evidence that there was life on Mars and not just microbial life, but an Intelligent Civilization. There is also evidence that this  Martian civilization was destroyed, possibly by nukes, since scientists have found xenon-135 in the atmosphere, which only occurs from nuclear bombs and not from any natural process. The truth we have lived on Mars a few million years ago. The Mars rover has already caught an image of a statue on Mars, YouTube it. ""Buddha Statue Spotted on Mars"" from that cycle. WE ARE THE ALIENS, do you see? WE ARE THE RACE WHO BUILT CITIES ON THE MOON. WE DID IT ALL BEFORE. There aren't any aliens. It's us, folks. We destroyed Mars and Fled to Earth, https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2015/pdf/2660.pdf We keep having to do this whole progress thing over and over again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mhZBLUyybo ""This is a world where nothing is solved. You know, someone once told me time is a flat circle. Everything we’ve ever done, or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and over again.""  


And the Bible is merely a secret message showing what humanity is like, and how it will end every single time. Not that there is any Satan. There is a God but he only holds the universe together, he does not dabble in his creation. We are alone with ourselves. We are our own captains. We are in control of our destiny. But every time, those with money seek to maintain power and wealth, and begin hoarding, building a separate layer between themselves and us so we can't find them... those are the so-called world leaders WE SEE. Those are the disposable faces of power. Their true power is invisible, hidden, their homes are not printed on any maps, the people who build those homes get killed after their made, so no one even knows they exist, or where they are. They have the technology to live totally off the grid, the satellites to have the internet at full speed 24/7 even in the most remote places. They own seed banks to repopulate the Earth with. They have life extension technologies. They have huge computers that would make the NSA jealous. They write the laws. They make the deals. They set the planet to spinning. OR so they think.

But every last time we get to this stage or just beyond, they fuck it up. They are the Satan, the destroying force. Humanity keeps getting reset. That's why there are so many pieces of evidence of so-called ""alien life"" out there. But imagine if time was no object. Imagine if 30,000 or 100,000 years could go by before we could even try again. Imagine if a man was reduced to barbarians who had no technology for a million years. No spark to set them going, progressing back up. It would seem some advanced alien race came here, seeded our planet, gave rise to us. But that's all BS. We were the aliens. It's always been us. That's what they don't want you to know. Next year Open Eyes takes place and the truth will be revealed no more drip disclosure. 

Because the alien threat is their invention, as a control scheme. Ronald Reagan in the 1980s was allowed to say it best, later redacted but still out there for us to know about...
