1kain92,sustainability,action-oriented,Plastic bag production energy and petroleum consumption,"So, as you know there have been quite a bit of studies comparing paper or cotton vs plastic bag carbon  footprint. I wanted to know what methodology was used to calculate the environmental costs of each bag particularly the plastic bags. And while i see raw material production for paper and cotton bags such as eutrophication due to fertiliser use etc but not much mention on environmental impact of oil drilling. Plastic bags are lighter and use less materials than both cotton and paper bags so their carbon emissions being less makes sense but i really wanted to know the carbon emissions of oil production and PE production etc and whether they're added into plastic bags production or not? Any leads related to this topic would be greatly appreciated",2025-04-29 08:02:51,1,2.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/1kain92/plastic_bag_production_energy_and_petroleum/,True,Tuotus,1746548186.931554,carbon footprint,solutions,,
1kh3nh7,climatechange,action-oriented,Which scientific figure most persuasively convinces educated skeptics of Climate Change?,"I recently had a conversation with someone who expressed skepticism about the reality of climate change. This person holds a degree in economics and values data-driven evidence but mentioned they've never encountered compelling data that convincingly demonstrates climate change.

If you had to select just one scientific figure (strongly backed up by evidence/data) to present to an educated skeptic, which would it be? I'm looking for a clear, easy-to-understand figure that effectively illustrates global warming or climate change—something that would be difficult to dismiss for someone who claims to believe in data.

Update: This person's main argument is that many environmental claims are not grounded in direct observations or empirical data. Instead, they believe these claims often rely on reanalysis or models, which they view as uncertain.",2025-05-07 17:46:26,37,69.0,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kh3nh7/which_scientific_figure_most_persuasively/,True,Melodic-Bed244,1746700583.12641,climate data,scientific,,

1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 02:48:14,367,46.0,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,False,TuneGlum7903,1746700614.774505,climate data,scientific,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**.

In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate. 

-Tokyo is having train delays, says [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpmlwap/) from the world’s largest megacity (metro pop: 38M, *shiiiiit*). **Food shortages**, including for rice, are also being recorded. Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind. The ocean will claim its due.",2025-05-03 09:30:24,8,1.0,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,True,freedcreativity,1746700618.531748,climate data,scientific,,

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

https://preview.redd.it/jnvvpx5j9aye1.jpeg?width=2329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5212929e12e6c3092885e908d8cf2f10a454c1e0

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:

I write and post on a number of sites and have been attacked for having no “academic credentials” in any field related to climate science. I do not wish to misrepresent myself as a “climate scientist” or “climate expert” to anyone who is reading this or any of my other climate related posts, so let us be clear:

I am not a climatologist, meteorologist, paleo-climatologist, geoscientist, ecologist, or climate science specialist. I am a motivated individual studying the issue using publicly available datasets and papers.

The analysis I am presenting is my own. I make no claim to “insider or hidden knowledge” and all the points I discuss can be verified with only a few hours of research on the Internet.

The analysis and opinion I present, in this and my other climate articles is exactly that: my opinion. I hope anyone reading it finds it useful, informative, and insightful but in the end, it is just my opinion.

1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,I'm a complete ignoramus about this topic: Please educate me and give me some pointers,"Hello wonderful folks: I'm coming down to earth after years of denial in a radical section of the Church, that is intent upon looking away from climate change and the catastrophic effects of human choices upon plant and animal life. Climate change, they say, is a left wing hoax. I used to believe it for a long time and scoff at people who suggested something was seriously off with the planet.

They say the first step towards change is admitting there is a problem. While I understand that our current use of natural resources is unsustainable in the long run, and accept that climate change is real, I hardly know what I can do to make a change.

I hardly buy clothes, and when I do, I keep them for life. I buy them from military hardware store (Silvermans) so as to have extreme durability and lifespan. I have started to recycle. As you can see from my user name, I am a incense enthusiast. I've learnt a lot about the exploitation of trees for incense and only buy sustainable resins and from sources that ethically source plant resins. But what else can I do? The amount of information online is overwhelming.

Could you please give me a good starting point about learning about sustainability. I'm an intensely pragmatic person who believes in *doing* rather than *talking.* I live modestly, and I say this not as a matter of virtue signalling; just as a matter of fact. I don't drive. I eat vegetarian food. Milk is still hard to quit. Use public transport exclusively. But that's about it.

But I'd love to *do* more. If you know resources that I can use to convince some of my other friends, please point these out to. There is deep denial in some quarters. And I believe the answer is in providing so much information that denial becomes impossible. This is how I began to see the problem.

It's been a humbling and somewhat terrifying journey as I am starting to reckon the impact of my choices. I still don't want it to be true. It causes me serious anxiety as I deeply love the natural world and the thought of it all fading away is giving me sleepless nights. Is it really as bad as I think it is, and is the situation beyond hope? Please provide scientific, meaningful, practical responses. I'd rather hear the bad news than live in the land of lotus eaters.",2025-05-05 18:10:30,11,20.0,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/1kfijtv/im_a_complete_ignoramus_about_this_topic_please/,True,IncenseHound,1746547491.1448162,climate anxiety,emotional,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough.

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat.

UN annual funding for Ukraine [is being reprioritized](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/ukraine-war-briefing-un-slashes-humanitarian-aid-after-sharp-fall-in-funding) and reduced by about one third (to $1.75B).

While some sources indicate 30,000+ people join the Russian army every month (one way or another), Russian authorities are discussing a potential [**WWII-style mobilization**](https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-says-russia-ready-for-full-scale-mobilization-like-in-wwii-at-any-moment/), which involves not only the armed forces, but also industry and society more generally. Poland is [scaling up military training](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9exj0nn0ko) for civilians as fears of Russian aggression grow. Ukraine’s energy minister [warned](https://archive.ph/0kdhY) that Russia is gambling with nuclear meltdown by targeting nuclear power plants and the repair teams working at their substations. “**We have been one step short of a nuclear meltdown many times now**,” he said. Russia also [acknowledged North Koreans](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/05/03/frontline-report-russia-plans-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-new-offensives-in-eastern-ukraine) fighting for them for the first time, finally discarding the pretense of implausible deniability. 

The sounds of battle—**shelling, gunfire, explosions**—were heard around Damascus (metro pop: 2.8M), Syria on Tuesday & Wednesday. At least [16 were slain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/deadly-syria-clashes-continue-for-second-day-outside-damascus) in attacks against the Druze minority, though some sources [say 40+ dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kjn0jkjo). The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack. 

Two months after Israel imposed a blockade on supplies to Gaza, food is [running out](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2vz02e7g8o). Israeli sky drones [attacked & disabled a ship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/gaza-humanitarian-aid-ship-bombed-drones-waters-off-malta) off the coast of Malta, which was planning on challenging the blockade to deliver supplies to Gaza. The vessel was *en route* to Malta, where it was also going to pick up Greta Thunberg. In Gaza, [**airstrikes killed 17** on Friday](https://archive.ph/ZOnQa) on Friday, people are raiding warehouses for supplies, [airstrikes killed dozens more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/03/israeli-airstrikes-gaza-death-toll-bureij-beit-lahiya-khan-younis) on Saturday, food prices [continue rising](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/gaza-on-brink-of-catastrophe-as-aid-runs-out-and-prices-soar-groups-warn), and the IDF is [**summoning tens of thousands of reservists**](https://www.yahoo.com/news/reports-israel-calls-tens-thousands-213032823.html) to service. Hours ago, a Houthi drone [struck near Ben Gurion airport](https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1918917490287026668); no casualties.  

A 54-page, U.S.-aligned think tank [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025) on **threats in space**—by countries—was published two weeks ago. Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened. The report does not mention the possibility of [Kessler Syndrome](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/). Although funding for the Pentagon is set to decrease, President Trump’s [overall **defense budget hit new highs**](https://archive.ph/ZjRyI), breaching $1T for the first time ever. And that doesn’t even include [increases to Homeland Security](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/trump-budget-proposal-defense-spending)’s budget—or mention the wide-ranging cuts to science, welfare, health, and environmental programs.

>“the growth of **commercial and military dual-use technologies** that could be modified to serve a counterspace purpose.…widespread jamming and spoofing of GPS signals in and around conflict zones….a common thread throughout this year’s report is how space fits into the future of warfare. The normalization of space as a military operational domain and its integral role in joint operations mean that **space is fair game during conflict**….space is likely becoming a more dangerous place…” -excerpts from the Space Report

India and Pakistan are escalating their……theatrics/preparation/negotiation/deterrence. India [test-fired missiles](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/india-test-fires-missiles-tensions-rise-pakistan-kashmir-attack) last Sunday. On Wednesday, Pakistani authorities [said](https://www.newsweek.com/pakistan-india-kashmir-nuclear-missiles-war-2066322) that India was planning “**imminent military action**” within 24-36 hours, but nothing yet materialized. On Saturday, Pakistan [test-fired a ballistic missile](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/3/pakistan-test-fires-ballistic-missile-as-tensions-with-india-rise). Some observers believe India [may launch restrained raids](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/411219/india-pakistan-kashmir-terrorist-attack-war) into Pakistan’s part of Kashmir [next](https://archive.ph/DUgG1). Each country possesses approximately **170 nuclear weapons.**

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate. 

-Tokyo is having train delays, says [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpmlwap/) from the world’s largest megacity (metro pop: 38M, *shiiiiit*). **Food shortages**, including for rice, are also being recorded. Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse. [**Ragebait** 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage-baiting). I am sure this goes far, far beyond one popular subreddit. Resilience begins with you.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months. Confidence in the U.S. Dollar [is weakening](https://thehill.com/opinion/5270094-trump-tariffs-dollar-decline/) as tariffs and uncertainty in the United States grow—a [reckoning might be coming](https://archive.ph/yNwAZ) soon. The [**loss of trust** in the market](https://archive.ph/jhbua) may not return after Trump leaves office. China [is planning](https://archive.ph/zQNoc) on moving forward without as many American food exports.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID.

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat. Yet in the last 13 months, [bird flu has been confirmed](https://archive.ph/Ix8Jh) in over 1,000 dairy herds across the United States.

The sounds of battle—**shelling, gunfire, explosions**—were heard around Damascus (metro pop: 2.8M), Syria on Tuesday & Wednesday. At least [16 were slain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/deadly-syria-clashes-continue-for-second-day-outside-damascus) in attacks against the Druze minority, though some sources [say 40+ dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kjn0jkjo). The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate.

Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse. [**Ragebait** 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage-baiting). I am sure this goes far, far beyond one popular subreddit. Resilience begins with you.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate.

Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID.

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat.

A 54-page, U.S.-aligned think tank [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025) on **threats in space**—by countries—was published two weeks ago. Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate. 

-Tokyo is having train delays, says [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpmlwap/) from the world’s largest megacity (metro pop: 38M, *shiiiiit*). **Food shortages**, including for rice, are also being recorded. Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse. [**Ragebait** 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage-baiting). I am sure this goes far, far beyond one popular subreddit. Resilience begins with you.

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

https://preview.redd.it/jnvvpx5j9aye1.jpeg?width=2329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5212929e12e6c3092885e908d8cf2f10a454c1e0

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:

I write and post on a number of sites and have been attacked for having no “academic credentials” in any field related to climate science. I do not wish to misrepresent myself as a “climate scientist” or “climate expert” to anyone who is reading this or any of my other climate related posts, so let us be clear:

I am not a climatologist, meteorologist, paleo-climatologist, geoscientist, ecologist, or climate science specialist. I am a motivated individual studying the issue using publicly available datasets and papers.

The analysis I am presenting is my own. I make no claim to “insider or hidden knowledge” and all the points I discuss can be verified with only a few hours of research on the Internet.

The analysis and opinion I present, in this and my other climate articles is exactly that: my opinion. I hope anyone reading it finds it useful, informative, and insightful but in the end, it is just my opinion.

mqr8l2g,collapse,skeptical,,While its true that capitalism is a mechanism to increase the rate of resource uptake and global consumption I don't think its capitalism. Capitalism or communism or some other form of organizing society are just means to decide how the surplus from industrial production is distributed in the society. While capitalism has led to a faster exploitation of nature and materials even in Stalin's time the goal was industrial production and workers who mined more were given praises and recognition.  The roots of the superorganism is might lie in the so-called growth imperative which simply means that economic growth is essential to society. This manifest as interest-rate on savings or debt more generally which creates a growth imperative. As to why this happened I am not so sure. Its not like there are some greedy individuals who were pulling the string and forsaw it all. While its true for short term profit motives I suspect even they couldn't forsee the trajectory of the human industrial society. Daniel Schmachtenberger (hope i got the name right) thinks that we arrived at this superorganism simply by virtue of following short term narrow boundary goals. No one is actively trying to kill the environment but the process of achieving one's goals (whatever they may be) put them in active opposition to the preservation of life and biodiversity on this earth. Take for example  buying lunch for oneself around worksite. It is possible that packed lunch or beverage will contain single-use plastic that will exist for a very long time without degrading and cause problems to other species. This really narrow goal of feeding oneself is at odds with preservation of animal species. If I understand correctly the solution is to actually have deterrent from the very beginning in a society to prevent such behaviour where an individual can 'win' at the cost of others by simply not following the rules. This used to be the case in small societies but in city level dwellings the connection between humans is lost and individual behaviour is dictated by these narrow boundary goals. The costs are externalities which one is not held accountable for. A good example of this is corporations (which are still a small group of people) polluting in other countries.,2025-05-05 19:06:46,3,,,,,yangihara,1746547679.7603588,climate crisis,emotional,t3_1kf23io,1kf23io

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID.

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate.

Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate.

Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

There are going to be a LOT of HOT days in 2025.

We cannot build renewables fast enough to keep up with the MASSIVELY increasing demand for electricity. AND, that's just electricity for households and manufacturing. It doesn't include the fossil fuels we use for shipping, mining, farming, air travel, and heavy industry.

Hell, we haven't stopped BURNING WOOD for energy yet.

""Globally, wood is a significant energy source, particularly in developing countries, accounting for a substantial portion of household energy consumption for cooking and heating. While a precise global percentage is difficult to pinpoint, a considerable amount of wood is burned for energy, with some studies suggesting that half of all wood harvested worldwide is used as fuelwood. In many developing countries, this figure can be as high as 90%.""

Even in the US burning wood accounts for about 4% of energy demand.

After all, if you move to a cabin in the woods, unless it has a solar array, electric heaters, electric water heating, and an electric stove. You are going to burn wood and wood IS as bad as a ""fossil fuel"" in terms of the pollution it causes.

We CANNOT build enough ""renewables"" to provide everyone on earth with a ""US equivalent"" lifestyle.

So much wrong with that comment I don’t know where to begin. First in a round about year you are not wrong, we aren’t set to be above 2 degrees from preindustrial levels, we are set to go well over that within the next 25 years. Also even if we somehow where to not no over the 2 degrees number that would still mean that many environments would see catastrophic changes in their ecosystems with mass extinctions, inhabitable land, reduced crop yield, etc. 2 degrees above pre industrial level is not a “good” goal to aspire to, that’s just a goal that was set on that was atleast somewhat realistic and that didn’t substantially pose a threat to first worlds counties production/ economy.

“Let’s not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable…electric vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by normal people” 
The main issue with this line of thinking is that solar panels/electric cars being economical or more practical doesn’t substantially change the way that people in the first world pollute to maintain standard of living. Like think of this what good does it make to use solar panels if we are suing it power stuff like air conditioning(which is really bad for the environment btw), machinery to make unnecessary cheap consumer goods, or to power things like large data centers for example which don’t just need power but large amounts of computers, communication infrastructure, land, and the construction of all that? Like of course if their is a choice between getting something powered by fossil fuels or solar panels obviously solar panels are the much better choice but the issue is that this is a change that is ultimately not nearly enough to make a substantial change in how our way of life impacts our environment. Like think about it like this, if someone close to me was telling me how bad smoking is and that I should stop, would it be reasonable for me to respond with “but my cigarette has a filter on it so it’s not as bad”? Like yes there are things that can make harmful behavior slightly better but the overall issue is not substantially being addressed with the marginal improvements.

“EV adoption is at record highs”
And why is this a good thing? Now if you were to tell me that instead all developed countries had limited their car production and were investing more in public transport then you would have some argument but this ultimately doesn’t help solve the issue. This relates to my last point in that this is just, in the grand scheme of things, this marginal improvement is just a way to make people feel better about a frivolous purchase in cars. Yes of course people have to buy cars, especially in a country like the U.S. but if we had a  more robust public transportation system that would mean less pollution since these public transit systems are more efficient per person per mile than cars(amount other things). Also electric cars tend to be higher weight than normal cars in the same class, and high weight cars means more wear and tear on roads which means more maintenance, which means more digging up of things like cement which are very carbon heavy. Like obviously public transport isn’t perfect and face similar issues(land use, rare earth minerals, building up of infrastructure) but the difference is that their is a substantial difference is in environment cost with transporting people via public transport vs cars.

“The enemy is a mere shadow of what is once was” 
That is really not the case in sorry my friend. I hope I didn’t sound mean in my response but people all across the world are suffering as a result of climate change. Look abt many island nations in the pacific that have lost islands or a substantial part of their land due to sea level rise. Or look at the rising number of extinct species and endangered species in Africa alone and how that affected their local ecosystems. How many record hot days have been recorded in just this decade and that number is rising pretty much every few years at this point. Like I don’t mean to harp on this point but I think that your optimism is misguided, perhaps because you are(I’m assuming) from a first world country that is not as severely affected by climate change as many developing countries but if you start looking at the effects of climate change in the global south you will see how fucked we are. I don’t means this to sound pessimistic but it’s the truth we are really fucked and we are well on our way to get even worse.

Obviously we have to continue to fight to mitigate the worst effects of climate change but these ultimately marginal improvements that make some changes to how badly we affect the environment is not a sign to be happy. I mean I think it’s actually kind of sad to see that the only reason renewable energy is being embraced is because it’s economical and not because it’s actually something that is of beneficial regardless of the cost.",2025-05-08 09:22:43,1,,,,,Odd-Garlic-8838,1746700075.780892,CO2 emissions,scientific,t3_1khjgbo,1khjgbo

>  
For me, it was the climate crisis — and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning — that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040 — the year I turn 60 — as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy. At the highest projected temperatures, they estimated, GDPs would plummet by 30% by 2080 in every country they modeled, including the United States.

>After the panel, I asked one of the presenters, Willemijn Verdegaal, what I should do to prepare for retirement, assuming the Earth stays on its current warming trajectory. ""In all honesty,"" she told me, ""there's very little point in you saving anything anymore.""",2025-05-05 18:16:04,321,62.0,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kfip1o/how_climate_change_threatens_retirement_for/,True,NoOutlandishness1848,1746700633.077733,global temperature rise,scientific,,
1khjgbo,climatechange,action-oriented,Why aren't we celebrating progress on climate change?,"It seems to me that we would rather be pessimistic than optimistic.

Like ""oh we are not doing enough"" or whatever.

But why aren't we celebrating what has already been done?

Let's not forget that just 50 years ago rivers would catch fire (see [Cuyahoga River Fire](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/), and it was a perfectly normal occurence too). Smog was everywhere in the cities. Coal plants released a lot of soot into the atmosphere.

Let's not forget that 20 years ago, at the turn of the millenium, scientists were predicting that the temperature would rise 4-5 degrees by 2100. Like think about this. Does this seem absurd to you? Now we got people complaining about getting to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels by 2100 which is not good but mind you probably won't happen anyways.

Let's not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable and will only be for environmentalists. That electrical vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by everyday people for everyday uses. That coal will still be used for the coming future (now granted it's replacement natural gas isn't exactly better but at least it doesn't create smog).

We are changing. And we are changing fast. EV adoption is at record highs, especially in China. When I went there before covid (Feb 2019) you'd be lucky to find an EV car that wasn't a taxi or a bus. I would say maybe only 1 in 20 or so (very very vague guess) were EVs. Now? The roads are a lot quieter (visited again in Mar 2025). The air is a lot cleaner. The infamous chinese smog? Gone. Just gone. And this has barely been a few years. The increasing economic viability of EVs has also made them appeal to many developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil. We are transitioning to solar energy at record speeds. Even Saudi Arabia, of all countries, is making huge leaps towards renewables (now granted whether or not they achieve that is another mystery).

Over half of Europe's energy is already renewable. China is adopting renewable energy at record speeds too with its solar adoption having increased by 1000x since the economic crisis (when the country started caring about solar). California is leading the country with green energy with over half of our energy being from renewables too. It is pretty common to see solar roofs everywhere. Even red states like Texas is adopting wind energy at record speeds. Everywhere around the world we are adopting renewables. Fast.

The fight is still ongoing. We have not defeated it. But the enemy is a mere shadow of what it once was. Self-combusting rivers are no longer a thing. Leaded gasoline aren't in road vehicles anymore. The ozone layer is rapidly recovering after CFCs got banned. Most of the bad stuff in our atmosphere half a century ago is gone. Knowledge of climate change is higher than it has ever been. CO2 emissions have finally plateaued and peaked in 2024. Renewable adoption is happening at speeds we could have never imagined just a few years ago and it is showing zero signs of slowing down.

Maybe we should just stop. Take a breather. And look at everything around us.

1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 02:48:14,373,46.0,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,False,TuneGlum7903,1746700661.668637,global temperature rise,scientific,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F).

Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough.

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK.

In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened. The report does not mention the possibility of [Kessler Syndrome](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/). Although funding for the Pentagon is set to decrease, President Trump’s [overall **defense budget hit new highs**](https://archive.ph/ZjRyI), breaching $1T for the first time ever. And that doesn’t even include [increases to Homeland Security](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/trump-budget-proposal-defense-spending)’s budget—or mention the wide-ranging cuts to science, welfare, health, and environmental programs.

>“the growth of **commercial and military dual-use technologies** that could be modified to serve a counterspace purpose.…widespread jamming and spoofing of GPS signals in and around conflict zones….a common thread throughout this year’s report is how space fits into the future of warfare. The normalization of space as a military operational domain and its integral role in joint operations mean that **space is fair game during conflict**….space is likely becoming a more dangerous place…” -excerpts from the Space Report

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate.

Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind. The ocean will claim its due.",2025-05-03 09:30:24,7,1.0,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,True,freedcreativity,1746700666.5753531,global temperature rise,scientific,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F).

Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough.

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind. The ocean will claim its due.",2025-05-03 09:30:24,7,1.0,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,True,freedcreativity,1746700028.721814,climate science,scientific,,

>  
For me, it was the climate crisis — and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning — that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040 — the year I turn 60 — as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy. At the highest projected temperatures, they estimated, GDPs would plummet by 30% by 2080 in every country they modeled, including the United States.

>After the panel, I asked one of the presenters, Willemijn Verdegaal, what I should do to prepare for retirement, assuming the Earth stays on its current warming trajectory. ""In all honesty,"" she told me, ""there's very little point in you saving anything anymore.""",2025-05-05 18:16:04,254,48.0,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kfip1o/how_climate_change_threatens_retirement_for/,True,NoOutlandishness1848,1746547967.441016,global warming myth,skeptical,,
1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 02:48:14,364,45.0,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,False,TuneGlum7903,1746547998.604411,global warming myth,skeptical,,

\*Trying to post this again.

The article from DR reports that the sea surrounding Denmark has warmed by approximately one degree Celsius over the past year. This significant increase is attributed to unusually high temperatures in April, raising concerns among climate scientists about the accelerating effects of climate change on marine environments.

Edit\* Sorry for the double post

English translation and recap of article:

# Heatstroke in April: The Sea Around Denmark Has Warmed by One Degree in a Year

The sea temperature around Denmark has risen by about one degree Celsius over the past year — a significant increase, according to Danish meteorologists.

**Unusually Warm April** April 2024 has brought record-high temperatures, not only on land but also at sea. The surface temperature in Danish waters is now about **1°C higher** than at the same time last year. This is based on data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).

**Climate Expert: A Warning Sign** According to climate researcher **Martin Olesen** from DMI, such a sharp rise in sea temperatures is concerning. While fluctuations occur naturally, this trend aligns with the broader effects of global warming. ""It's a warning sign that the sea is reacting strongly to climate change,"" he says.

**Consequences for Marine Life** Rising sea temperatures can affect marine ecosystems — fish stocks may shift, and the risk of **algae blooms** increases. Warmer waters also reduce the ocean's ability to absorb **CO₂**, which further accelerates global warming.

**Global Pattern** The temperature spike is not unique to Denmark. The World Meteorological Organization has reported **record-high ocean temperatures globally** in the past year.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.”

[Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered.

So much wrong with that comment I don’t know where to begin. First in a round about year you are not wrong, we aren’t set to be above 2 degrees from preindustrial levels, we are set to go well over that within the next 25 years. Also even if we somehow where to not no over the 2 degrees number that would still mean that many environments would see catastrophic changes in their ecosystems with mass extinctions, inhabitable land, reduced crop yield, etc. 2 degrees above pre industrial level is not a “good” goal to aspire to, that’s just a goal that was set on that was atleast somewhat realistic and that didn’t substantially pose a threat to first worlds counties production/ economy.

“Let’s not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable…electric vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by normal people” 
The main issue with this line of thinking is that solar panels/electric cars being economical or more practical doesn’t substantially change the way that people in the first world pollute to maintain standard of living. Like think of this what good does it make to use solar panels if we are suing it power stuff like air conditioning(which is really bad for the environment btw), machinery to make unnecessary cheap consumer goods, or to power things like large data centers for example which don’t just need power but large amounts of computers, communication infrastructure, land, and the construction of all that? Like of course if their is a choice between getting something powered by fossil fuels or solar panels obviously solar panels are the much better choice but the issue is that this is a change that is ultimately not nearly enough to make a substantial change in how our way of life impacts our environment. Like think about it like this, if someone close to me was telling me how bad smoking is and that I should stop, would it be reasonable for me to respond with “but my cigarette has a filter on it so it’s not as bad”? Like yes there are things that can make harmful behavior slightly better but the overall issue is not substantially being addressed with the marginal improvements.

“EV adoption is at record highs”
And why is this a good thing? Now if you were to tell me that instead all developed countries had limited their car production and were investing more in public transport then you would have some argument but this ultimately doesn’t help solve the issue. This relates to my last point in that this is just, in the grand scheme of things, this marginal improvement is just a way to make people feel better about a frivolous purchase in cars. Yes of course people have to buy cars, especially in a country like the U.S. but if we had a  more robust public transportation system that would mean less pollution since these public transit systems are more efficient per person per mile than cars(amount other things). Also electric cars tend to be higher weight than normal cars in the same class, and high weight cars means more wear and tear on roads which means more maintenance, which means more digging up of things like cement which are very carbon heavy. Like obviously public transport isn’t perfect and face similar issues(land use, rare earth minerals, building up of infrastructure) but the difference is that their is a substantial difference is in environment cost with transporting people via public transport vs cars.

“The enemy is a mere shadow of what is once was” 
That is really not the case in sorry my friend. I hope I didn’t sound mean in my response but people all across the world are suffering as a result of climate change. Look abt many island nations in the pacific that have lost islands or a substantial part of their land due to sea level rise. Or look at the rising number of extinct species and endangered species in Africa alone and how that affected their local ecosystems. How many record hot days have been recorded in just this decade and that number is rising pretty much every few years at this point. Like I don’t mean to harp on this point but I think that your optimism is misguided, perhaps because you are(I’m assuming) from a first world country that is not as severely affected by climate change as many developing countries but if you start looking at the effects of climate change in the global south you will see how fucked we are. I don’t means this to sound pessimistic but it’s the truth we are really fucked and we are well on our way to get even worse.

Obviously we have to continue to fight to mitigate the worst effects of climate change but these ultimately marginal improvements that make some changes to how badly we affect the environment is not a sign to be happy. I mean I think it’s actually kind of sad to see that the only reason renewable energy is being embraced is because it’s economical and not because it’s actually something that is of beneficial regardless of the cost.",2025-05-08 09:22:43,1,,,,,Odd-Garlic-8838,1746700544.128266,CO2 emissions,scientific,t3_1khjgbo,1khjgbo

1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,I'm a complete ignoramus about this topic: Please educate me and give me some pointers,"Hello wonderful folks: I'm coming down to earth after years of denial in a radical section of the Church, that is intent upon looking away from climate change and the catastrophic effects of human choices upon plant and animal life. Climate change, they say, is a left wing hoax. I used to believe it for a long time and scoff at people who suggested something was seriously off with the planet.

They say the first step towards change is admitting there is a problem. While I understand that our current use of natural resources is unsustainable in the long run, and accept that climate change is real, I hardly know what I can do to make a change.

I hardly buy clothes, and when I do, I keep them for life. I buy them from military hardware store (Silvermans) so as to have extreme durability and lifespan. I have started to recycle. As you can see from my user name, I am a incense enthusiast. I've learnt a lot about the exploitation of trees for incense and only buy sustainable resins and from sources that ethically source plant resins. But what else can I do? The amount of information online is overwhelming.

Could you please give me a good starting point about learning about sustainability. I'm an intensely pragmatic person who believes in *doing* rather than *talking.* I live modestly, and I say this not as a matter of virtue signalling; just as a matter of fact. I don't drive. I eat vegetarian food. Milk is still hard to quit. Use public transport exclusively. But that's about it.

But I'd love to *do* more. If you know resources that I can use to convince some of my other friends, please point these out to. There is deep denial in some quarters. And I believe the answer is in providing so much information that denial becomes impossible. This is how I began to see the problem.

It's been a humbling and somewhat terrifying journey as I am starting to reckon the impact of my choices. I still don't want it to be true. It causes me serious anxiety as I deeply love the natural world and the thought of it all fading away is giving me sleepless nights. Is it really as bad as I think it is, and is the situation beyond hope? Please provide scientific, meaningful, practical responses.

1kda74q,climatechange,action-oriented,Jevons Paradox: What it is and what it’s not,"**Jevons Paradox: What it is and what it’s not**

There’s a lot of confusion online about Jevons Paradox — especially when it’s used to argue that making renewables cheaper somehow *keeps fossil fuels alive*. That’s not what the paradox says. Let’s clear this up.

---

###  **What is Jevons Paradox?**

Jevons Paradox comes from 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons. He observed that **as steam engines became more efficient**, they made coal-powered energy cheaper — and total **coal consumption increased**, not decreased.

**In short:**  
> *Making a resource cheaper or more efficient to use can lead to *more* demand for that same resource.*

Example:
- In the 1800s, **more efficient steam engines** made coal more useful. This led to an explosion in coal use and **displaced older tech like waterwheels** and manual labor.

---

### **What Jevons Paradox is *not***:

It’s not a law that says efficiency always backfires.  
It’s not a reason why fossil fuels will persist forever.  
And crucially, it **does not apply** when one energy source **replaces** another — that’s called **substitution**, not Jevons.

---

###  **Substitution is not Jevons**

Let’s look at some examples of substitution — cases where *new* energy or transport technologies displaced *older* ones:

-  **Cheap fracked natural gas** in the U.S. displaced coal in electricity generation. Gas was cheaper and cleaner, so coal plants shut down. That’s **not** Jevons — that’s substitution.
-  **Cheap automobiles** replaced horses. Nobody said, “cars got so cheap that we started breeding more horses.”
-  **Electric lighting** replaced gas lamps and candles. We didn’t suddenly consume more whale oil because LEDs got cheaper.
-  **Cheap solar and wind** are now displacing coal and increasingly gas, because they’re becoming the cheapest sources of electricity in many markets.

If Jevons Paradox applied in these cases, we’d see *more* of the old resource being used. But we don’t — we see it being pushed out.

---

### **So what *is* happening with energy today?**

Yes, total electricity demand is rising — from EVs, heat pumps, data centers, and development. That’s true. But that doesn’t *require* fossil fuels to grow. It just means **we need more energy** — and the cheapest sources will win.

If fossil fuels aren’t being phased out quickly enough, the reasons are:

- Political lobbying and regulatory capture
- Market inertia and grid bottlenecks
- Subsidies that favor incumbents

Those are real problems — but they’re not Jevons Paradox.

---

###  **Bottom Line**

Jevons Paradox says that making a *resource* more efficient can increase its use.  
It **does not** say that switching to a new, cheaper energy source will keep the old one alive.  
In fact, history shows the opposite: **the cheaper resource usually wins** — and pushes the old one out.

---

**TL;DR**:  
Cheaper solar ≠ more coal.  
Cheaper gas ≠ more coal.  
Cheaper cars ≠ more horses.

mr44w4u,climatechange,action-oriented,,"Any singular scientific figure would just be dismissed as not the whole picture. A combination of scientific analysis as well as who is doing the analysis is much more convincing. 

Richard Muller, funded by Charles Koch Charitable Foundation, was a climate sceptic. He and 12 other skeptics were [paid by fossil fuel companies, but actually found evidence climate change was real](https://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/climatechange-denier-changes-mind/news-story/e0433a661400feb82345e5d5108cc2ce)

In 2011, he stated that “following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.”

If you’re looking for an example of the opposite, a climate scientist who believed in anthropogenic climate change, and actually found evidence against it… there isn’t one. Needless to say the fossil fuel industry never funded Muller again.

If there was a way to disprove or dispute AGW, the fossil fuel industry would fund it and there would be examples of it. But they are more than aware with humanity’s impact

mr424gd,climatechange,action-oriented,,"It is a well known fact that climate change is caused by humans. Let’s look at the evidence:

1. CO2 causes warming. This is easy to prove. You can look up tabletop experiments you can try in your kitchen. Tl;dr is that CO2 absorbs light and release it as heat. 

2. Humans are the main source of CO2. We know this because CO2 picks up as the Industrial Revolution began, which is when we started combustion billions of tons of carbon rich materials that used to be locked in long-term geologic storage. We know this from measuring gas bubbles in ice cores. We know exactly what was in the air for the past few thousand years. 

3. The only modeling and uncertainty is where the climate is going. But those models are really good. In fact, the climate models are so good that major petroleum companies used to use them to predict where to find fossil fuel deposits (while funding climate denial campaigns). 


In terms of one figure, I don’t think there’s one that will convince them. Mauna Loa shows a persistent, increasing rate of CO2 in the atmosphere. ShowYourStripes shows persistent increased tropospheric temperatures. If I had to pick one, I’d do this one from [New Scientist that shows air and sea surface temperatures](https://images.app.goo.gl/nAWB8sEXZ8gTw7sS8) for the past few years (notice how similar those temperature curves are to CO2!). 

I work in industrial decarbonization and it’s remarkable how many companies who used to say climate change isn’t real are now pouring billions of dollars into climate technologies.

3. Runs an extensive vegetable garden.

From an economics perspective, in particular - with the massive growth in a range of global multi-billion solutions industries and a broad range of commercial clean innovative technologies - to what extent do we need to keep working on building ""belief in the problem""?  

The world's innovators and entrepreneurs were convinced there were opportunities decades ago - and many have been relentlessly commercialising solutions since the 1990s. (Though solar panels actually date back to the 1860s - because innovators just want to innovate.)

Today, renewable energy, EVs and regenerative agriculture are high-growth multi-billion dollar global industries, and many more solutions are scaling.  In parallel, 21st century design approaches such as full-spectrum Circular Economy and Biomimicry are driving trillion-dollar innovation opportunities in industry with rapidly shrinking payback periods.

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

\*Trying to post this again.

The article from DR reports that the sea surrounding Denmark has warmed by approximately one degree Celsius over the past year. This significant increase is attributed to unusually high temperatures in April, raising concerns among climate scientists about the accelerating effects of climate change on marine environments.

Edit\* Sorry for the double post

English translation and recap of article:

# Heatstroke in April: The Sea Around Denmark Has Warmed by One Degree in a Year

The sea temperature around Denmark has risen by about one degree Celsius over the past year — a significant increase, according to Danish meteorologists.

**Unusually Warm April** April 2024 has brought record-high temperatures, not only on land but also at sea. The surface temperature in Danish waters is now about **1°C higher** than at the same time last year. This is based on data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).

**Climate Expert: A Warning Sign** According to climate researcher **Martin Olesen** from DMI, such a sharp rise in sea temperatures is concerning. While fluctuations occur naturally, this trend aligns with the broader effects of global warming. ""It's a warning sign that the sea is reacting strongly to climate change,"" he says.

**Consequences for Marine Life** Rising sea temperatures can affect marine ecosystems — fish stocks may shift, and the risk of **algae blooms** increases. Warmer waters also reduce the ocean's ability to absorb **CO₂**, which further accelerates global warming.

**Global Pattern** The temperature spike is not unique to Denmark. The World Meteorological Organization has reported **record-high ocean temperatures globally** in the past year.

1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 02:48:14,361,45.0,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,False,TuneGlum7903,1746547310.850704,climate data,scientific,,

The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.”

[Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind. The ocean will claim its due.",2025-05-03 09:30:24,6,1.0,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,True,freedcreativity,1746547314.437291,climate data,scientific,,

1kfip1o,climatechange,action-oriented,How climate change threatens retirement for millenials,"This Business Insider story on [""Millenial Retirement Panic""](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-of-millennial-retirement-panic-boomer-parents-saving-401k-market-2025-5) makes an important point about what climate change could do to Millenials' retirement plans:

>  
For me, it was the climate crisis — and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning — that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040 — the year I turn 60 — as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy. At the highest projected temperatures, they estimated, GDPs would plummet by 30% by 2080 in every country they modeled, including the United States.

>After the panel, I asked one of the presenters, Willemijn Verdegaal, what I should do to prepare for retirement, assuming the Earth stays on its current warming trajectory. ""In all honesty,"" she told me, ""there's very little point in you saving anything anymore.""",2025-05-05 18:16:04,324,62.0,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kfip1o/how_climate_change_threatens_retirement_for/,True,NoOutlandishness1848,1746700166.8474848,global temperature rise,scientific,,
1khjgbo,climatechange,action-oriented,Why aren't we celebrating progress on climate change?,"It seems to me that we would rather be pessimistic than optimistic.

Like ""oh we are not doing enough"" or whatever.

But why aren't we celebrating what has already been done?

Let's not forget that just 50 years ago rivers would catch fire (see [Cuyahoga River Fire](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/), and it was a perfectly normal occurence too). Smog was everywhere in the cities. Coal plants released a lot of soot into the atmosphere.

Let's not forget that 20 years ago, at the turn of the millenium, scientists were predicting that the temperature would rise 4-5 degrees by 2100. Like think about this. Does this seem absurd to you? Now we got people complaining about getting to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels by 2100 which is not good but mind you probably won't happen anyways.

Let's not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable and will only be for environmentalists. That electrical vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by everyday people for everyday uses. That coal will still be used for the coming future (now granted it's replacement natural gas isn't exactly better but at least it doesn't create smog).

We are changing. And we are changing fast. EV adoption is at record highs, especially in China. When I went there before covid (Feb 2019) you'd be lucky to find an EV car that wasn't a taxi or a bus. I would say maybe only 1 in 20 or so (very very vague guess) were EVs. Now? The roads are a lot quieter (visited again in Mar 2025). The air is a lot cleaner. The infamous chinese smog? Gone. Just gone. And this has barely been a few years. The increasing economic viability of EVs has also made them appeal to many developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil. We are transitioning to solar energy at record speeds. Even Saudi Arabia, of all countries, is making huge leaps towards renewables (now granted whether or not they achieve that is another mystery).

Over half of Europe's energy is already renewable. China is adopting renewable energy at record speeds too with its solar adoption having increased by 1000x since the economic crisis (when the country started caring about solar). California is leading the country with green energy with over half of our energy being from renewables too. It is pretty common to see solar roofs everywhere. Even red states like Texas is adopting wind energy at record speeds. Everywhere around the world we are adopting renewables. Fast.

The fight is still ongoing. We have not defeated it. But the enemy is a mere shadow of what it once was. Self-combusting rivers are no longer a thing. Leaded gasoline aren't in road vehicles anymore. The ozone layer is rapidly recovering after CFCs got banned. Most of the bad stuff in our atmosphere half a century ago is gone. Knowledge of climate change is higher than it has ever been. CO2 emissions have finally plateaued and peaked in 2024. Renewable adoption is happening at speeds we could have never imagined just a few years ago and it is showing zero signs of slowing down.

Maybe we should just stop. Take a breather. And look at everything around us. It isn't as bad as we would like to believe.",2025-05-08 06:32:31,0,65.0,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1khjgbo/why_arent_we_celebrating_progress_on_climate/,True,___Cyanide___,1746700168.748818,global temperature rise,scientific,,
1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 02:48:14,365,46.0,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,False,TuneGlum7903,1746700194.316154,global temperature rise,scientific,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem.

[Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**.

The sounds of battle—**shelling, gunfire, explosions**—were heard around Damascus (metro pop: 2.8M), Syria on Tuesday & Wednesday. At least [16 were slain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/deadly-syria-clashes-continue-for-second-day-outside-damascus) in attacks against the Druze minority, though some sources [say 40+ dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kjn0jkjo). The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack.

Hours ago, a Houthi drone [struck near Ben Gurion airport](https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1918917490287026668); no casualties.  

A 54-page, U.S.-aligned think tank [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025) on **threats in space**—by countries—was published two weeks ago. Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened. The report does not mention the possibility of [Kessler Syndrome](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/). Although funding for the Pentagon is set to decrease, President Trump’s [overall **defense budget hit new highs**](https://archive.ph/ZjRyI), breaching $1T for the first time ever.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind. The ocean will claim its due.",2025-05-03 09:30:24,7,1.0,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,True,freedcreativity,1746700199.7198029,global temperature rise,scientific,,
1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,I'm a complete ignoramus about this topic: Please educate me and give me some pointers,"Hello wonderful folks: I'm coming down to earth after years of denial in a radical section of the Church, that is intent upon looking away from climate change and the catastrophic effects of human choices upon plant and animal life. Climate change, they say, is a left wing hoax. I used to believe it for a long time and scoff at people who suggested something was seriously off with the planet.

They say the first step towards change is admitting there is a problem. While I understand that our current use of natural resources is unsustainable in the long run, and accept that climate change is real, I hardly know what I can do to make a change.

I hardly buy clothes, and when I do, I keep them for life. I buy them from military hardware store (Silvermans) so as to have extreme durability and lifespan. I have started to recycle. As you can see from my user name, I am a incense enthusiast. I've learnt a lot about the exploitation of trees for incense and only buy sustainable resins and from sources that ethically source plant resins. But what else can I do? The amount of information online is overwhelming.

Could you please give me a good starting point about learning about sustainability. I'm an intensely pragmatic person who believes in *doing* rather than *talking.* I live modestly, and I say this not as a matter of virtue signalling; just as a matter of fact. I don't drive. I eat vegetarian food. Milk is still hard to quit. Use public transport exclusively. But that's about it.

But I'd love to *do* more. If you know resources that I can use to convince some of my other friends, please point these out to. There is deep denial in some quarters. And I believe the answer is in providing so much information that denial becomes impossible. This is how I began to see the problem.

It's been a humbling and somewhat terrifying journey as I am starting to reckon the impact of my choices. I still don't want it to be true. It causes me serious anxiety as I deeply love the natural world and the thought of it all fading away is giving me sleepless nights. Is it really as bad as I think it is, and is the situation beyond hope? Please provide scientific, meaningful, practical responses.

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

https://preview.redd.it/jnvvpx5j9aye1.jpeg?width=2329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5212929e12e6c3092885e908d8cf2f10a454c1e0

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:

I write and post on a number of sites and have been attacked for having no “academic credentials” in any field related to climate science. I do not wish to misrepresent myself as a “climate scientist” or “climate expert” to anyone who is reading this or any of my other climate related posts, so let us be clear:

I am not a climatologist, meteorologist, paleo-climatologist, geoscientist, ecologist, or climate science specialist. I am a motivated individual studying the issue using publicly available datasets and papers.

The analysis I am presenting is my own. I make no claim to “insider or hidden knowledge” and all the points I discuss can be verified with only a few hours of research on the Internet.

The analysis and opinion I present, in this and my other climate articles is exactly that: my opinion. I hope anyone reading it finds it useful, informative, and insightful but in the end, it is just my opinion.

1khjgbo,climatechange,action-oriented,Why aren't we celebrating progress on climate change?,"It seems to me that we would rather be pessimistic than optimistic.

Like ""oh we are not doing enough"" or whatever.

But why aren't we celebrating what has already been done?

Let's not forget that just 50 years ago rivers would catch fire (see [Cuyahoga River Fire](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/), and it was a perfectly normal occurence too). Smog was everywhere in the cities. Coal plants released a lot of soot into the atmosphere.

Let's not forget that 20 years ago, at the turn of the millenium, scientists were predicting that the temperature would rise 4-5 degrees by 2100. Like think about this. Does this seem absurd to you? Now we got people complaining about getting to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels by 2100 which is not good but mind you probably won't happen anyways.

Let's not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable and will only be for environmentalists. That electrical vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by everyday people for everyday uses. That coal will still be used for the coming future (now granted it's replacement natural gas isn't exactly better but at least it doesn't create smog).

We are changing. And we are changing fast. EV adoption is at record highs, especially in China. When I went there before covid (Feb 2019) you'd be lucky to find an EV car that wasn't a taxi or a bus. I would say maybe only 1 in 20 or so (very very vague guess) were EVs. Now? The roads are a lot quieter (visited again in Mar 2025). The air is a lot cleaner. The infamous chinese smog? Gone. Just gone. And this has barely been a few years. The increasing economic viability of EVs has also made them appeal to many developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil. We are transitioning to solar energy at record speeds. Even Saudi Arabia, of all countries, is making huge leaps towards renewables (now granted whether or not they achieve that is another mystery).

Over half of Europe's energy is already renewable. China is adopting renewable energy at record speeds too with its solar adoption having increased by 1000x since the economic crisis (when the country started caring about solar). California is leading the country with green energy with over half of our energy being from renewables too. It is pretty common to see solar roofs everywhere. Even red states like Texas is adopting wind energy at record speeds. Everywhere around the world we are adopting renewables. Fast.

The fight is still ongoing. We have not defeated it. But the enemy is a mere shadow of what it once was. Self-combusting rivers are no longer a thing. Leaded gasoline aren't in road vehicles anymore. The ozone layer is rapidly recovering after CFCs got banned. Most of the bad stuff in our atmosphere half a century ago is gone. Knowledge of climate change is higher than it has ever been. CO2 emissions have finally plateaued and peaked in 2024. Renewable adoption is happening at speeds we could have never imagined just a few years ago and it is showing zero signs of slowing down.

Maybe we should just stop. Take a breather. And look at everything around us.

1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,I'm a complete ignoramus about this topic: Please educate me and give me some pointers,"Hello wonderful folks: I'm coming down to earth after years of denial in a radical section of the Church, that is intent upon looking away from climate change and the catastrophic effects of human choices upon plant and animal life. Climate change, they say, is a left wing hoax. I used to believe it for a long time and scoff at people who suggested something was seriously off with the planet.

They say the first step towards change is admitting there is a problem. While I understand that our current use of natural resources is unsustainable in the long run, and accept that climate change is real, I hardly know what I can do to make a change.

I hardly buy clothes, and when I do, I keep them for life. I buy them from military hardware store (Silvermans) so as to have extreme durability and lifespan. I have started to recycle. As you can see from my user name, I am a incense enthusiast. I've learnt a lot about the exploitation of trees for incense and only buy sustainable resins and from sources that ethically source plant resins. But what else can I do? The amount of information online is overwhelming.

Could you please give me a good starting point about learning about sustainability. I'm an intensely pragmatic person who believes in *doing* rather than *talking.* I live modestly, and I say this not as a matter of virtue signalling; just as a matter of fact. I don't drive. I eat vegetarian food. Milk is still hard to quit. Use public transport exclusively. But that's about it.

But I'd love to *do* more. If you know resources that I can use to convince some of my other friends, please point these out to. There is deep denial in some quarters. And I believe the answer is in providing so much information that denial becomes impossible. This is how I began to see the problem.

It's been a humbling and somewhat terrifying journey as I am starting to reckon the impact of my choices. I still don't want it to be true. It causes me serious anxiety as I deeply love the natural world and the thought of it all fading away is giving me sleepless nights. Is it really as bad as I think it is, and is the situation beyond hope? Please provide scientific, meaningful, practical responses.

mqsztks,climatechange,action-oriented,,"The sleeper issue with climate change is its effects on agriculture and agricultural commodity PRICES.

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

Nobody has 'priced this in' yet.  Those that have saved, will be a great deal better off than those that haven't, but just having 'money in the bank' will not spare you from the worst effects of climate change.  

If you have the ability, it's a good idea to take a small portion of your savings and invest in things that cut your dependency to the outside world as much as possible.  Some ideas I've posted elsewhere:

* A one year supply of food, medicine and essentials.
* Raised beds, aquaponics, and egg hens for fruit, vegge and protien.  Honestly just learning *how* to raise your own food is more valuable than the food itself.
* A well or metal roof and rainwater collection system, as well as the parts to repair it.
* A solar / battery install capable of handling your average usage in winter
* An EV, and e-bike, service manuals and 'consumable spare parts' for both
* A ham radio setup.  Cell networks get overloaded during an emergency and towers go down after a few days without fuel during an extended outage.
* A firearm, and enough experience with it to be effective.  A simple 12ga pump is a great all rounder.

I'm not saying you should be a crazy prepper kitting out his dooms day bunker planning on riding out the apocalypse alone.  Get to know your neighbors.  Share your knowledge and teach them to be more resilient too if they're open to it.  When societies break down, communities stand up.  Take care of your 'tribe' to the best of your ability.

mr7seba,climatechange,action-oriented,,"“Now we have people complaining about getting 2 degrees above preindustrial levels by 2100 which is not good but kind you won’t probably happen” 
So much wrong with that comment I don’t know where to begin. First in a round about year you are not wrong, we aren’t set to be above 2 degrees from preindustrial levels, we are set to go well over that within the next 25 years. Also even if we somehow where to not no over the 2 degrees number that would still mean that many environments would see catastrophic changes in their ecosystems with mass extinctions, inhabitable land, reduced crop yield, etc. 2 degrees above pre industrial level is not a “good” goal to aspire to, that’s just a goal that was set on that was atleast somewhat realistic and that didn’t substantially pose a threat to first worlds counties production/ economy.

“Let’s not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable…electric vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by normal people” 
The main issue with this line of thinking is that solar panels/electric cars being economical or more practical doesn’t substantially change the way that people in the first world pollute to maintain standard of living. Like think of this what good does it make to use solar panels if we are suing it power stuff like air conditioning(which is really bad for the environment btw), machinery to make unnecessary cheap consumer goods, or to power things like large data centers for example which don’t just need power but large amounts of computers, communication infrastructure, land, and the construction of all that? Like of course if their is a choice between getting something powered by fossil fuels or solar panels obviously solar panels are the much better choice but the issue is that this is a change that is ultimately not nearly enough to make a substantial change in how our way of life impacts our environment. Like think about it like this, if someone close to me was telling me how bad smoking is and that I should stop, would it be reasonable for me to respond with “but my cigarette has a filter on it so it’s not as bad”? Like yes there are things that can make harmful behavior slightly better but the overall issue is not substantially being addressed with the marginal improvements.

“EV adoption is at record highs”
And why is this a good thing? Now if you were to tell me that instead all developed countries had limited their car production and were investing more in public transport then you would have some argument but this ultimately doesn’t help solve the issue. This relates to my last point in that this is just, in the grand scheme of things, this marginal improvement is just a way to make people feel better about a frivolous purchase in cars. Yes of course people have to buy cars, especially in a country like the U.S. but if we had a  more robust public transportation system that would mean less pollution since these public transit systems are more efficient per person per mile than cars(amount other things). Also electric cars tend to be higher weight than normal cars in the same class, and high weight cars means more wear and tear on roads which means more maintenance, which means more digging up of things like cement which are very carbon heavy. Like obviously public transport isn’t perfect and face similar issues(land use, rare earth minerals, building up of infrastructure) but the difference is that their is a substantial difference is in environment cost with transporting people via public transport vs cars.

“The enemy is a mere shadow of what is once was” 
That is really not the case in sorry my friend. I hope I didn’t sound mean in my response but people all across the world are suffering as a result of climate change. Look abt many island nations in the pacific that have lost islands or a substantial part of their land due to sea level rise. Or look at the rising number of extinct species and endangered species in Africa alone and how that affected their local ecosystems. How many record hot days have been recorded in just this decade and that number is rising pretty much every few years at this point. Like I don’t mean to harp on this point but I think that your optimism is misguided, perhaps because you are(I’m assuming) from a first world country that is not as severely affected by climate change as many developing countries but if you start looking at the effects of climate change in the global south you will see how fucked we are. I don’t means this to sound pessimistic but it’s the truth we are really fucked and we are well on our way to get even worse.

Obviously we have to continue to fight to mitigate the worst effects of climate change but these ultimately marginal improvements that make some changes to how badly we affect the environment is not a sign to be happy. I mean I think it’s actually kind of sad to see that the only reason renewable energy is being embraced is because it’s economical and not because it’s actually something that is of beneficial regardless of the cost.",2025-05-08 09:22:43,1,,,,,Odd-Garlic-8838,1746700635.67408,global temperature rise,scientific,t3_1khjgbo,1khjgbo

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months. Confidence in the U.S. Dollar [is weakening](https://thehill.com/opinion/5270094-trump-tariffs-dollar-decline/) as tariffs and uncertainty in the United States grow—a [reckoning might be coming](https://archive.ph/yNwAZ) soon. The [**loss of trust** in the market](https://archive.ph/jhbua) may not return after Trump leaves office. China [is planning](https://archive.ph/zQNoc) on moving forward without as many American food exports.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat.

Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind.

1kfip1o,climatechange,action-oriented,How climate change threatens retirement for millenials,"This Business Insider story on [""Millenial Retirement Panic""](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-of-millennial-retirement-panic-boomer-parents-saving-401k-market-2025-5) makes an important point about what climate change could do to Millenials' retirement plans:

>  
For me, it was the climate crisis — and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning — that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040 — the year I turn 60 — as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy.

1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 02:48:14,359,45.0,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,False,TuneGlum7903,1746547677.097756,climate crisis,emotional,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

There’s a lot of confusion online about Jevons Paradox — especially when it’s used to argue that making renewables cheaper somehow *keeps fossil fuels alive*. That’s not what the paradox says. Let’s clear this up.

---

###  **What is Jevons Paradox?**

Jevons Paradox comes from 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons. He observed that **as steam engines became more efficient**, they made coal-powered energy cheaper — and total **coal consumption increased**, not decreased.

**In short:**  
> *Making a resource cheaper or more efficient to use can lead to *more* demand for that same resource.*

Example:
- In the 1800s, **more efficient steam engines** made coal more useful. This led to an explosion in coal use and **displaced older tech like waterwheels** and manual labor.

---

### **What Jevons Paradox is *not***:

It’s not a law that says efficiency always backfires.  
It’s not a reason why fossil fuels will persist forever.  
And crucially, it **does not apply** when one energy source **replaces** another — that’s called **substitution**, not Jevons.

---

###  **Substitution is not Jevons**

Let’s look at some examples of substitution — cases where *new* energy or transport technologies displaced *older* ones:

-  **Cheap fracked natural gas** in the U.S. displaced coal in electricity generation. Gas was cheaper and cleaner, so coal plants shut down. That’s **not** Jevons — that’s substitution.
-  **Cheap automobiles** replaced horses. Nobody said, “cars got so cheap that we started breeding more horses.”
-  **Electric lighting** replaced gas lamps and candles. We didn’t suddenly consume more whale oil because LEDs got cheaper.
-  **Cheap solar and wind** are now displacing coal and increasingly gas, because they’re becoming the cheapest sources of electricity in many markets.

If Jevons Paradox applied in these cases, we’d see *more* of the old resource being used. But we don’t — we see it being pushed out.

---

### **So what *is* happening with energy today?**

Yes, total electricity demand is rising — from EVs, heat pumps, data centers, and development. That’s true. But that doesn’t *require* fossil fuels to grow. It just means **we need more energy** — and the cheapest sources will win.

If fossil fuels aren’t being phased out quickly enough, the reasons are:

- Political lobbying and regulatory capture
- Market inertia and grid bottlenecks
- Subsidies that favor incumbents

Those are real problems — but they’re not Jevons Paradox.

---

###  **Bottom Line**

Jevons Paradox says that making a *resource* more efficient can increase its use.  
It **does not** say that switching to a new, cheaper energy source will keep the old one alive.  
In fact, history shows the opposite: **the cheaper resource usually wins** — and pushes the old one out.

---

**TL;DR**:  
Cheaper solar ≠ more coal.  
Cheaper gas ≠ more coal.  
Cheaper cars ≠ more horses.  
Let’s stop misusing Jevons Paradox to justify defeatism about the energy transition.",2025-05-02 19:55:35,25,31.0,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kda74q/jevons_paradox_what_it_is_and_what_its_not/,True,Economy-Fee5830,1746547852.403528,green energy transition,action_oriented,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours.

The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK.

In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

Pay attention to what goes down your drain. Aim to capture and use as much water as you can before it goes down the drain. Read the label of cleaning supplies and ask yourself if you really think the chemicals should be in the water.

Recognize where responsibility lies for the problems that were facing. Recycling sounds good, but it was actually intended to keep us happy using more plastic.

In terms of literature, I found the Bill Gates; How to Avoid Climate Disaster to be a great introduction to the problem and how society is poised to either solve it or perish. As posited in the book, I am a big proponent of businesses changing, vs. personal consumption changing. I feel as though this sub, and many sustainability movements focus on the personal choices we can make (ie; consumption) vs collaborative and business related efforts. Even if you don't work in oil-n-gas, you can make significantly more impact if you get a business or corporation to alter their strategy in a way that is beneficial for the planet. 

What's beneficial for the planet? If you really want to go deep, come over the Lifecycleassessment sub; where we discuss life cycle analysis; the only quantified method of environmental impact measurment that is universally agreed upon. One has to measure before they can effectively reduce...

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

Nobody has 'priced this in' yet.  Those that have saved, will be a great deal better off than those that haven't, but just having 'money in the bank' will not spare you from the worst effects of climate change.  

If you have the ability, it's a good idea to take a small portion of your savings and invest in things that cut your dependency to the outside world as much as possible.  Some ideas I've posted elsewhere:

* A one year supply of food, medicine and essentials.
* Raised beds, aquaponics, and egg hens for fruit, vegge and protien.  Honestly just learning *how* to raise your own food is more valuable than the food itself.
* A well or metal roof and rainwater collection system, as well as the parts to repair it.
* A solar / battery install capable of handling your average usage in winter
* An EV, and e-bike, service manuals and 'consumable spare parts' for both
* A ham radio setup.  Cell networks get overloaded during an emergency and towers go down after a few days without fuel during an extended outage.
* A firearm, and enough experience with it to be effective.  A simple 12ga pump is a great all rounder.

I'm not saying you should be a crazy prepper kitting out his dooms day bunker planning on riding out the apocalypse alone.  Get to know your neighbors.  Share your knowledge and teach them to be more resilient too if they're open to it.  When societies break down, communities stand up.  Take care of your 'tribe' to the best of your ability.

mr7seba,climatechange,action-oriented,,"“Now we have people complaining about getting 2 degrees above preindustrial levels by 2100 which is not good but kind you won’t probably happen” 
So much wrong with that comment I don’t know where to begin. First in a round about year you are not wrong, we aren’t set to be above 2 degrees from preindustrial levels, we are set to go well over that within the next 25 years. Also even if we somehow where to not no over the 2 degrees number that would still mean that many environments would see catastrophic changes in their ecosystems with mass extinctions, inhabitable land, reduced crop yield, etc. 2 degrees above pre industrial level is not a “good” goal to aspire to, that’s just a goal that was set on that was atleast somewhat realistic and that didn’t substantially pose a threat to first worlds counties production/ economy.

“Let’s not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable…electric vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by normal people” 
The main issue with this line of thinking is that solar panels/electric cars being economical or more practical doesn’t substantially change the way that people in the first world pollute to maintain standard of living. Like think of this what good does it make to use solar panels if we are suing it power stuff like air conditioning(which is really bad for the environment btw), machinery to make unnecessary cheap consumer goods, or to power things like large data centers for example which don’t just need power but large amounts of computers, communication infrastructure, land, and the construction of all that? Like of course if their is a choice between getting something powered by fossil fuels or solar panels obviously solar panels are the much better choice but the issue is that this is a change that is ultimately not nearly enough to make a substantial change in how our way of life impacts our environment. Like think about it like this, if someone close to me was telling me how bad smoking is and that I should stop, would it be reasonable for me to respond with “but my cigarette has a filter on it so it’s not as bad”? Like yes there are things that can make harmful behavior slightly better but the overall issue is not substantially being addressed with the marginal improvements.

“EV adoption is at record highs”
And why is this a good thing? Now if you were to tell me that instead all developed countries had limited their car production and were investing more in public transport then you would have some argument but this ultimately doesn’t help solve the issue. This relates to my last point in that this is just, in the grand scheme of things, this marginal improvement is just a way to make people feel better about a frivolous purchase in cars. Yes of course people have to buy cars, especially in a country like the U.S. but if we had a  more robust public transportation system that would mean less pollution since these public transit systems are more efficient per person per mile than cars(amount other things). Also electric cars tend to be higher weight than normal cars in the same class, and high weight cars means more wear and tear on roads which means more maintenance, which means more digging up of things like cement which are very carbon heavy. Like obviously public transport isn’t perfect and face similar issues(land use, rare earth minerals, building up of infrastructure) but the difference is that their is a substantial difference is in environment cost with transporting people via public transport vs cars.

“The enemy is a mere shadow of what is once was” 
That is really not the case in sorry my friend. I hope I didn’t sound mean in my response but people all across the world are suffering as a result of climate change. Look abt many island nations in the pacific that have lost islands or a substantial part of their land due to sea level rise. Or look at the rising number of extinct species and endangered species in Africa alone and how that affected their local ecosystems. How many record hot days have been recorded in just this decade and that number is rising pretty much every few years at this point. Like I don’t mean to harp on this point but I think that your optimism is misguided, perhaps because you are(I’m assuming) from a first world country that is not as severely affected by climate change as many developing countries but if you start looking at the effects of climate change in the global south you will see how fucked we are. I don’t means this to sound pessimistic but it’s the truth we are really fucked and we are well on our way to get even worse.

Obviously we have to continue to fight to mitigate the worst effects of climate change but these ultimately marginal improvements that make some changes to how badly we affect the environment is not a sign to be happy. I mean I think it’s actually kind of sad to see that the only reason renewable energy is being embraced is because it’s economical and not because it’s actually something that is of beneficial regardless of the cost.",2025-05-08 09:22:43,1,,,,,Odd-Garlic-8838,1746700169.344287,global temperature rise,scientific,t3_1khjgbo,1khjgbo

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 02:48:14,365,46.0,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,False,TuneGlum7903,1746700150.180484,climate data,scientific,,

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat.

Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind.

Pay attention to what goes down your drain. Aim to capture and use as much water as you can before it goes down the drain. Read the label of cleaning supplies and ask yourself if you really think the chemicals should be in the water.

Recognize where responsibility lies for the problems that were facing. Recycling sounds good, but it was actually intended to keep us happy using more plastic.

I feel as though this sub, and many sustainability movements focus on the personal choices we can make (ie; consumption) vs collaborative and business related efforts.

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

Like ""oh we are not doing enough"" or whatever.

But why aren't we celebrating what has already been done?

Let's not forget that just 50 years ago rivers would catch fire (see [Cuyahoga River Fire](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/), and it was a perfectly normal occurence too). Smog was everywhere in the cities. Coal plants released a lot of soot into the atmosphere.

Let's not forget that 20 years ago, at the turn of the millenium, scientists were predicting that the temperature would rise 4-5 degrees by 2100. Like think about this. Does this seem absurd to you? Now we got people complaining about getting to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels by 2100 which is not good but mind you probably won't happen anyways.

Let's not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable and will only be for environmentalists. That electrical vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by everyday people for everyday uses. That coal will still be used for the coming future (now granted it's replacement natural gas isn't exactly better but at least it doesn't create smog).

We are changing. And we are changing fast. EV adoption is at record highs, especially in China. When I went there before covid (Feb 2019) you'd be lucky to find an EV car that wasn't a taxi or a bus. I would say maybe only 1 in 20 or so (very very vague guess) were EVs. Now? The roads are a lot quieter (visited again in Mar 2025). The air is a lot cleaner. The infamous chinese smog? Gone. Just gone. And this has barely been a few years. The increasing economic viability of EVs has also made them appeal to many developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil. We are transitioning to solar energy at record speeds. Even Saudi Arabia, of all countries, is making huge leaps towards renewables (now granted whether or not they achieve that is another mystery).

Over half of Europe's energy is already renewable. China is adopting renewable energy at record speeds too with its solar adoption having increased by 1000x since the economic crisis (when the country started caring about solar). California is leading the country with green energy with over half of our energy being from renewables too. It is pretty common to see solar roofs everywhere. Even red states like Texas is adopting wind energy at record speeds. Everywhere around the world we are adopting renewables. Fast.

The fight is still ongoing. We have not defeated it. But the enemy is a mere shadow of what it once was. Self-combusting rivers are no longer a thing. Leaded gasoline aren't in road vehicles anymore. The ozone layer is rapidly recovering after CFCs got banned. Most of the bad stuff in our atmosphere half a century ago is gone. Knowledge of climate change is higher than it has ever been. CO2 emissions have finally plateaued and peaked in 2024. Renewable adoption is happening at speeds we could have never imagined just a few years ago and it is showing zero signs of slowing down.

Maybe we should just stop. Take a breather. And look at everything around us.

For me, it was the climate crisis — and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning — that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040 — the year I turn 60 — as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy. At the highest projected temperatures, they estimated, GDPs would plummet by 30% by 2080 in every country they modeled, including the United States.

The article from DR reports that the sea surrounding Denmark has warmed by approximately one degree Celsius over the past year.

English translation and recap of article:

# Heatstroke in April: The Sea Around Denmark Has Warmed by One Degree in a Year

The sea temperature around Denmark has risen by about one degree Celsius over the past year — a significant increase, according to Danish meteorologists.

**Unusually Warm April** April 2024 has brought record-high temperatures, not only on land but also at sea. The surface temperature in Danish waters is now about **1°C higher** than at the same time last year. This is based on data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).

**Climate Expert: A Warning Sign** According to climate researcher **Martin Olesen** from DMI, such a sharp rise in sea temperatures is concerning. While fluctuations occur naturally, this trend aligns with the broader effects of global warming. ""It's a warning sign that the sea is reacting strongly to climate change,"" he says.

**Consequences for Marine Life** Rising sea temperatures can affect marine ecosystems — fish stocks may shift, and the risk of **algae blooms** increases. Warmer waters also reduce the ocean's ability to absorb **CO₂**, which further accelerates global warming.

**Global Pattern** The temperature spike is not unique to Denmark. The World Meteorological Organization has reported **record-high ocean temperatures globally** in the past year.

1kcqpa5,collapse,skeptical,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months. Confidence in the U.S. Dollar [is weakening](https://thehill.com/opinion/5270094-trump-tariffs-dollar-decline/) as tariffs and uncertainty in the United States grow—a [reckoning might be coming](https://archive.ph/yNwAZ) soon. The [**loss of trust** in the market](https://archive.ph/jhbua) may not return after Trump leaves office. China [is planning](https://archive.ph/zQNoc) on moving forward without as many American food exports.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat. Yet in the last 13 months, [bird flu has been confirmed](https://archive.ph/Ix8Jh) in over 1,000 dairy herds across the United States.

Mali’s post-coup government has [declared their leading General](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddej3g123do), Assimi Goïta, to a 5-year term as President. Goïta has been the interim president since 2021, when he seized power in a coup d’état (his [second successful coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) ). Togo’s President [got himself installed in a new position](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjl9l9z7zjo) that will enable him to rule the country indefinitely—his family has been in power for 58 years now. 

Helicopters [**bombed a hospital**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2536m9r2eo) in South Sudan and reportedly opened fire on a city for half an hour; seven were slain. Not far away, in Sudan, rebel forces were said to have [**slain 37**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/27/sudan-doctors-network-accuses-rsf-of-war-crimes-after-31-killed).

A [Russian drone attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd02x9zr78ro) in Odesa killed two and injured several more. A [**minerals deal**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-russia) was agreed between the U.S. and Ukraine which will, in theory, pay the U.S. a portion of the profits from rare earth and other minerals/oil/gas extracted in Ukraine—until $175B USD is repaid to the U.S. (Read the [full deal text here](https://kyivindependent.com/exclusive-the-full-text-of-the-final-us-ukraine-mineral-agreement/) if interested.) Using the Vietnam War as an example, some experts are [worried about **widespread damage**](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-years-vietnam-environment-scars-war.html) **to the environment** in Ukraine and Gaza in the decades after the bombs stop. For the first time, a Ukrainian sea drone [shot down a Russian fighter jet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/ukraine-war-briefing-maritime-drone-shoots-down-russian-fighter-jet-for-first-time-says-kyiv).  And, although Russians make small gains along the frontlines, Ukraine [declared victory](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-victory-pokrovsk-donetsk-russia-2065951) in the strategic city of Pokrovsk. UN annual funding for Ukraine [is being reprioritized](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/ukraine-war-briefing-un-slashes-humanitarian-aid-after-sharp-fall-in-funding) and reduced by about one third (to $1.75B).

While some sources indicate 30,000+ people join the Russian army every month (one way or another), Russian authorities are discussing a potential [**WWII-style mobilization**](https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-says-russia-ready-for-full-scale-mobilization-like-in-wwii-at-any-moment/), which involves not only the armed forces, but also industry and society more generally. Poland is [scaling up military training](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9exj0nn0ko) for civilians as fears of Russian aggression grow. Ukraine’s energy minister [warned](https://archive.ph/0kdhY) that Russia is gambling with nuclear meltdown by targeting nuclear power plants and the repair teams working at their substations. “**We have been one step short of a nuclear meltdown many times now**,” he said. Russia also [acknowledged North Koreans](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/05/03/frontline-report-russia-plans-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-new-offensives-in-eastern-ukraine) fighting for them for the first time, finally discarding the pretense of implausible deniability. 

The sounds of battle—**shelling, gunfire, explosions**—were heard around Damascus (metro pop: 2.8M), Syria on Tuesday & Wednesday. At least [16 were slain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/deadly-syria-clashes-continue-for-second-day-outside-damascus) in attacks against the Druze minority, though some sources [say 40+ dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kjn0jkjo). The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack. 

Two months after Israel imposed a blockade on supplies to Gaza, food is [running out](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2vz02e7g8o). Israeli sky drones [attacked & disabled a ship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/gaza-humanitarian-aid-ship-bombed-drones-waters-off-malta) off the coast of Malta, which was planning on challenging the blockade to deliver supplies to Gaza. The vessel was *en route* to Malta, where it was also going to pick up Greta Thunberg. In Gaza, [**airstrikes killed 17** on Friday](https://archive.ph/ZOnQa) on Friday, people are raiding warehouses for supplies, [airstrikes killed dozens more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/03/israeli-airstrikes-gaza-death-toll-bureij-beit-lahiya-khan-younis) on Saturday, food prices [continue rising](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/gaza-on-brink-of-catastrophe-as-aid-runs-out-and-prices-soar-groups-warn), and the IDF is [**summoning tens of thousands of reservists**](https://www.yahoo.com/news/reports-israel-calls-tens-thousands-213032823.html) to service.

A 54-page, U.S.-aligned think tank [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025) on **threats in space**—by countries—was published two weeks ago. Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened. The report does not mention the possibility of [Kessler Syndrome](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/). Although funding for the Pentagon is set to decrease, President Trump’s [overall **defense budget hit new highs**](https://archive.ph/ZjRyI), breaching $1T for the first time ever.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate. 

-Tokyo is having train delays, says [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpmlwap/) from the world’s largest megacity (metro pop: 38M, *shiiiiit*). **Food shortages**, including for rice, are also being recorded. Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind. The ocean will claim its due.",2025-05-03 09:30:24,6,1.0,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,True,freedcreativity,1746547364.838488,global temperature rise,scientific,,

Richard Muller, funded by Charles Koch Charitable Foundation, was a climate sceptic. He and 12 other skeptics were [paid by fossil fuel companies, but actually found evidence climate change was real](https://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/climatechange-denier-changes-mind/news-story/e0433a661400feb82345e5d5108cc2ce)

In 2011, he stated that “following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.”

If you’re looking for an example of the opposite, a climate scientist who believed in anthropogenic climate change, and actually found evidence against it… there isn’t one. Needless to say the fossil fuel industry never funded Muller again.

If there was a way to disprove or dispute AGW, the fossil fuel industry would fund it and there would be examples of it. But they are more than aware with humanity’s impact

mr424gd,climatechange,action-oriented,,"It is a well known fact that climate change is caused by humans. Let’s look at the evidence:

1. CO2 causes warming. This is easy to prove. You can look up tabletop experiments you can try in your kitchen. Tl;dr is that CO2 absorbs light and release it as heat. 

2. Humans are the main source of CO2. We know this because CO2 picks up as the Industrial Revolution began, which is when we started combustion billions of tons of carbon rich materials that used to be locked in long-term geologic storage. We know this from measuring gas bubbles in ice cores. We know exactly what was in the air for the past few thousand years. 

3. The only modeling and uncertainty is where the climate is going. But those models are really good. In fact, the climate models are so good that major petroleum companies used to use them to predict where to find fossil fuel deposits (while funding climate denial campaigns). 


In terms of one figure, I don’t think there’s one that will convince them. Mauna Loa shows a persistent, increasing rate of CO2 in the atmosphere. ShowYourStripes shows persistent increased tropospheric temperatures. If I had to pick one, I’d do this one from [New Scientist that shows air and sea surface temperatures](https://images.app.goo.gl/nAWB8sEXZ8gTw7sS8) for the past few years (notice how similar those temperature curves are to CO2!). 

I work in industrial decarbonization and it’s remarkable how many companies who used to say climate change isn’t real are now pouring billions of dollars into climate technologies.

1. Has an extensive home solar and battery setup - because they want to be grid-independent

2. Raves about the performance and superb driving experience of their EV.

3. Runs an extensive vegetable garden.

From an economics perspective, in particular - with the massive growth in a range of global multi-billion solutions industries and a broad range of commercial clean innovative technologies - to what extent do we need to keep working on building ""belief in the problem""?  

The world's innovators and entrepreneurs were convinced there were opportunities decades ago - and many have been relentlessly commercialising solutions since the 1990s. (Though solar panels actually date back to the 1860s - because innovators just want to innovate.)

Today, renewable energy, EVs and regenerative agriculture are high-growth multi-billion dollar global industries, and many more solutions are scaling.  In parallel, 21st century design approaches such as full-spectrum Circular Economy and Biomimicry are driving trillion-dollar innovation opportunities in industry with rapidly shrinking payback periods.

It could be more useful to advance a narrative that ""today's regenerative solutions make the world better today"" or ""today's clean technology solutions drive increased business innovation and long-term prosperity today"".

  If you want to change someone else’s behavior, offer them a more compelling narrative they can tell themselves. "" (found on [Farnham Street](https://fs.blog/brain-food/march-16-2025/))

In my observation over recent years, ""the scientific evidence isn't there"" can be an narrative used - often reflexively - to justify avoiding  the perceived unrewarding effort and loss (particularly prevalent in many ""compliance and frugality"" change prescriptions).

If your end-game is to convince the person you're in conversation with that they can take meaningful action today, do you actually need to convince them of the problem?   Or could your time be better spent communicating the benefits of today's rich smorgasbord of career-building regenerative solutions?",2025-05-08 02:39:02,1,,,,,ThinkActRegenerate,1746700583.873755,climate data,scientific,t3_1kh3nh7,1kh3nh7

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F).

Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough.

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered.

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat. Yet in the last 13 months, [bird flu has been confirmed](https://archive.ph/Ix8Jh) in over 1,000 dairy herds across the United States.

[**Arbitrary arrests**](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/least-89-arbitrary-arrests-recorded-syria-april-2025-enar) made in Syria. Hundreds were also [arrested in Türkiye](https://news.sky.com/story/hundreds-arrested-in-turkey-during-worldwide-may-day-demonstrations-and-rallies-13359146) during **May Day protests**. India’s army is [allegedly poised](https://archive.ph/Ni8Ny) to stamp out hundreds of armed communist guerrillas, naxalites, in the country’s southeast. Niagara Falls—the Canadian side, mostly—is getting [**overwhelmed**](https://archive.ph/ltsOv) **by migrants**. 

Uganda’s octogenarian president is [trying to prosecute civilians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/uganda-opposition-accuses-president-military-courts-quash-dissent)—his political opponents—in **military tribunals** which may carry the death penalty. Mali’s post-coup government has [declared their leading General](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddej3g123do), Assimi Goïta, to a 5-year term as President. Goïta has been the interim president since 2021, when he seized power in a coup d’état (his [second successful coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) ). Togo’s President [got himself installed in a new position](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjl9l9z7zjo) that will enable him to rule the country indefinitely—his family has been in power for 58 years now. 

Helicopters [**bombed a hospital**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2536m9r2eo) in South Sudan and reportedly opened fire on a city for half an hour; seven were slain. Not far away, in Sudan, rebel forces were said to have [**slain 37**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/27/sudan-doctors-network-accuses-rsf-of-war-crimes-after-31-killed). Reporting from Khartoum indicates that the Sudan War [destroyed the world’s oldest mycetoma research center](https://archive.ph/TV5HN), including 40+ years of data. [Mycetoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycetoma) is a bacterial/fungal infection of the skin, usually the feet. Over 540 people are [said to have been **killed**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/1/sudan-horror-knows-no-bounds-says-un-as-deaths-in-darfur-rise) **in Sudan** over the past three weeks, with other estimates going much higher. 

North Korea [launched a **new naval destroyer**](https://news.sky.com/story/kim-jong-un-unveils-north-koreas-new-naval-destroyer-equipped-with-the-most-powerful-weapons-13355744), reportedly capable of launching nuclear ballistic missiles. [Japan is sweating](https://archive.ph/5ydUJ) over Chinese maneuvers around Taiwan, and considering how deeply they would be involved in a future War.

A [Russian drone attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd02x9zr78ro) in Odesa killed two and injured several more. A [**minerals deal**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-russia) was agreed between the U.S. and Ukraine which will, in theory, pay the U.S. a portion of the profits from rare earth and other minerals/oil/gas extracted in Ukraine—until $175B USD is repaid to the U.S. (Read the [full deal text here](https://kyivindependent.com/exclusive-the-full-text-of-the-final-us-ukraine-mineral-agreement/) if interested.) Using the Vietnam War as an example, some experts are [worried about **widespread damage**](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-years-vietnam-environment-scars-war.html) **to the environment** in Ukraine and Gaza in the decades after the bombs stop. For the first time, a Ukrainian sea drone [shot down a Russian fighter jet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/ukraine-war-briefing-maritime-drone-shoots-down-russian-fighter-jet-for-first-time-says-kyiv).  And, although Russians make small gains along the frontlines, Ukraine [declared victory](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-victory-pokrovsk-donetsk-russia-2065951) in the strategic city of Pokrovsk. UN annual funding for Ukraine [is being reprioritized](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/ukraine-war-briefing-un-slashes-humanitarian-aid-after-sharp-fall-in-funding) and reduced by about one third (to $1.75B).

While some sources indicate 30,000+ people join the Russian army every month (one way or another), Russian authorities are discussing a potential [**WWII-style mobilization**](https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-says-russia-ready-for-full-scale-mobilization-like-in-wwii-at-any-moment/), which involves not only the armed forces, but also industry and society more generally. Poland is [scaling up military training](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9exj0nn0ko) for civilians as fears of Russian aggression grow. Ukraine’s energy minister [warned](https://archive.ph/0kdhY) that Russia is gambling with nuclear meltdown by targeting nuclear power plants and the repair teams working at their substations. “**We have been one step short of a nuclear meltdown many times now**,” he said. Russia also [acknowledged North Koreans](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/05/03/frontline-report-russia-plans-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-new-offensives-in-eastern-ukraine) fighting for them for the first time, finally discarding the pretense of implausible deniability. 

The sounds of battle—**shelling, gunfire, explosions**—were heard around Damascus (metro pop: 2.8M), Syria on Tuesday & Wednesday. At least [16 were slain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/deadly-syria-clashes-continue-for-second-day-outside-damascus) in attacks against the Druze minority, though some sources [say 40+ dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kjn0jkjo). The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack. 

Two months after Israel imposed a blockade on supplies to Gaza, food is [running out](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2vz02e7g8o). Israeli sky drones [attacked & disabled a ship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/gaza-humanitarian-aid-ship-bombed-drones-waters-off-malta) off the coast of Malta, which was planning on challenging the blockade to deliver supplies to Gaza. The vessel was *en route* to Malta, where it was also going to pick up Greta Thunberg. In Gaza, [**airstrikes killed 17** on Friday](https://archive.ph/ZOnQa) on Friday, people are raiding warehouses for supplies, [airstrikes killed dozens more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/03/israeli-airstrikes-gaza-death-toll-bureij-beit-lahiya-khan-younis) on Saturday, food prices [continue rising](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/gaza-on-brink-of-catastrophe-as-aid-runs-out-and-prices-soar-groups-warn), and the IDF is [**summoning tens of thousands of reservists**](https://www.yahoo.com/news/reports-israel-calls-tens-thousands-213032823.html) to service. Hours ago, a Houthi drone [struck near Ben Gurion airport](https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1918917490287026668); no casualties.  

A 54-page, U.S.-aligned think tank [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025) on **threats in space**—by countries—was published two weeks ago. Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened. The report does not mention the possibility of [Kessler Syndrome](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/). Although funding for the Pentagon is set to decrease, President Trump’s [overall **defense budget hit new highs**](https://archive.ph/ZjRyI), breaching $1T for the first time ever. And that doesn’t even include [increases to Homeland Security](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/trump-budget-proposal-defense-spending)’s budget—or mention the wide-ranging cuts to science, welfare, health, and environmental programs.

>“the growth of **commercial and military dual-use technologies** that could be modified to serve a counterspace purpose.…widespread jamming and spoofing of GPS signals in and around conflict zones….a common thread throughout this year’s report is how space fits into the future of warfare. The normalization of space as a military operational domain and its integral role in joint operations mean that **space is fair game during conflict**….space is likely becoming a more dangerous place…” -excerpts from the Space Report

India and Pakistan are escalating their……theatrics/preparation/negotiation/deterrence. India [test-fired missiles](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/india-test-fires-missiles-tensions-rise-pakistan-kashmir-attack) last Sunday. On Wednesday, Pakistani authorities [said](https://www.newsweek.com/pakistan-india-kashmir-nuclear-missiles-war-2066322) that India was planning “**imminent military action**” within 24-36 hours, but nothing yet materialized. On Saturday, Pakistan [test-fired a ballistic missile](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/3/pakistan-test-fires-ballistic-missile-as-tensions-with-india-rise). Some observers believe India [may launch restrained raids](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/411219/india-pakistan-kashmir-terrorist-attack-war) into Pakistan’s part of Kashmir [next](https://archive.ph/DUgG1).

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate. 

-Tokyo is having train delays, says [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpmlwap/) from the world’s largest megacity (metro pop: 38M, *shiiiiit*). **Food shortages**, including for rice, are also being recorded. Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse. [**Ragebait** 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage-baiting). I am sure this goes far, far beyond one popular subreddit. Resilience begins with you.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes.

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months. Confidence in the U.S. Dollar [is weakening](https://thehill.com/opinion/5270094-trump-tariffs-dollar-decline/) as tariffs and uncertainty in the United States grow—a [reckoning might be coming](https://archive.ph/yNwAZ) soon. The [**loss of trust** in the market](https://archive.ph/jhbua) may not return after Trump leaves office. China [is planning](https://archive.ph/zQNoc) on moving forward without as many American food exports.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat.

Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered.

**Hello there, /r/Science!**

We* are a group of researchers who just [published a meta-analysis](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002) of expert agreement on humans causing global warming. 

The lead author John Cook has a video backgrounder on the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEb49cZYnsEl), and articles in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/consensus-confirmed-over-90-of-climate-scientists-believe-were-causing-global-warming-57654) and [Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](http://thebulletin.org/yes-there-really-scientific-consensus-climate-change9332). Coauthor Dana Nuccitelli also did a background post on his blog at the Guardian [here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming). 

You may have heard the statistic “97% of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming.” You may also have wondered where that number comes from, or even have heard that it was “debunked”. This metanalysis looks at a wealth of surveys (of scientists as well as the scientific literature) about scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, and [finds that among climate experts, the ~97% level among climate experts is pretty robust](http://i.imgur.com/oCevIhE.jpg). 

The upshot of our paper is that [the level of agreement with the consensus view increases with expertise](http://i.imgur.com/L7xpRny.png). 

When people claim the number is lower, they usually do so by cherry-picking the responses of groups of non-experts, such as [petroleum geologists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/02/14/james-taylor-misinterprets-study-by-180-degrees/) or [weathercasters](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/dec/02/meteorologists-global-warming-consensus). 

Why does any of this matter? Well, there is a growing body of scientific literature that shows the public’s perception of scientific agreement is a “gateway belief” for their attitudes on environmental questions (e.g. [Ding et *al.*, 2011](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html, [Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141), [van der Linden *et al.*, 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489), and more). In other words, if the public thinks scientists are divided on an issue, that causes the public to be less likely to agree that a problem exists and makes them less willing to do anything about it. Making sure the public understands the high level of expert agreement on this topic allows the public dialog to advance to more interesting and pressing questions, like what as a society we decided to do about the issue. 

We're here to answer your questions about this paper and more general, related topics. We ill be back later to answer your questions, Ask us anything!

Are there other competing models that accurately reflect what we know about AGW?

5byi0k,environment,emotional,Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",,22228,924.0,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,True,cam_man_can,1747616023.9744482,climate science,scientific,,

(1:00 EST) Great time answering your questions! The biggest themes were when is solar cost effective for me, solar cell recycling and life cycle analysis, and Tesla's solar relevant technologies. There are calculators to consider the first point - http://www.solar-estimate.org/ is just one example. First Solar is now recycling solar cell modules for large installations - great news! And, Tesla continues to push the envelope, but the cost effectiveness of such technoogies isn't proven yet.

I've seen a lot of blather about how a path to extinction isn't included in the package of economic desolation and environmental devastation we find ourselves unwrapping lately. How the human species has survived climate change before, how hunter gatherers can survive in isolated environments for centuries, how we may have a dieoff, but extinction is unthinkable.

I think that shows a stunning lack of imagination.

I want to go on a brief journey though some of the unknown factors we're facing as we reap the results of tossing [billions of tons of carbon dioxide](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/carbon-dioxide-earths-hottest-topic-just-warming) into the atmosphere every year. It's really easy to look at the projected sea level rises, the projected air and sea temperature rises, the increasing acidification of the oceans, and be convinced that we have a grasp of what we're up against. It looks, from our perspective here in 2016, like a bunch of smooth curves that we'll be climbing into some unimaginably hellish, but ultimately survivable future.

Instead, I think we're about to be surprised by the consequences of environmental disequilibrium. We're increasing the odds of a whole lot of bad things happening, and some of them we can't even begin to predict. Let's take a look at a few that we can.

The obvious one is the blue ocean event. This one is fun because we know it's going to happen, we just don't know when. The [US Navy](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/dec/09/us-navy-arctic-sea-ice-2016-melt) predicted it for this summer back in [2013](http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/article_f0d1fc46-56dc-11e3-9766-001a4bcf6878.html), and that's [not out of the question](https://robertscribbler.com/tag/blue-ocean-event/). So, what will it mean?

We're not sure. [We know](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/arctic-sea-ice-loss-implications/) it will include a lot more sunlight absorbed by the newly lowered albedo, resulting in warmer waters around the arctic, increasing storm frequency and strength. Oh, and the jet stream will weaken with the decreased global temperature gradient. It'll speed the melting of Greenland, which [may proceed unpredictably](http://www.rollingstone.com/feature/greenland-melting).

That's going to accelerate subsea permafrost melt in the Arctic. I'm not going to go deep into the implications of that [when it comes to methane](http://meetings.copernicus.org/www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/01526/EGU2008-A-01526.pdf), but suffice it to say that if the 1500 gigatons of methane clathrates under the East Siberian Sea decide to let out a burp, it could be bad. Because we currently have just 5 gigatons of methane in the entire atmosphere. Oh, and the ESS is tectonically unstable.

Even without earthquakes, the melting of the Arctic ice creates a whole new Arctic hazard; [tsunamis](https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic/articles/2016/03/25/the-icy-fire-beneath-norways-seabed). Imagine if you will what the effects of a big chunk of continental shelf letting go would be, [right in the middle](http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2014/06/earthquakes-and-warm-water-threaten-arctic.html) of the most sensitive environment on the planet.

So, to sum up the Arctic portion of my diatribe, we're about to see what happens when we have a major change in our climate state. We have no idea what the climate will do once we lose the Arctic ice, or how long it will take, but there's [considerable evidence](https://agwobserver.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/papers-on-ecosystem-response-to-past-climate/) that the climate has changed very quickly in the past. Sometimes in [as little as a year](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ice-core-reveals-how-quickly-climate-can-change/). And we don't know what it's changing into.

Now, all of these changes are being caused by the stuff we're pumping into the atmosphere; the gaseous detritus of human civilization. But I'm not convinced that we understand the full implications of those emissions yet. After all, it was just a few years ago that we figured out that [leaded gasoline led to crime waves](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health). Who knows what other gases that we're soaking in have unanticipated consequences? We've got toxic [firefighting foam](https://theintercept.com/2015/12/16/toxic-firefighting-foam-has-contaminated-u-s-drinking-water-with-pfcs/) invading our water supplies, the stuff used in making [teflon](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid--pfoa) is an omnipresent cancer risk. What else are we missing?

Well, how about the long-term health effects of increased carbon dioxide. It's gone from around 300ppm to 400 ppm in a human lifetime. We know it's keeping trees [from cooling the planet](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100503161435.htm), it's [devastating marine life](http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2007/01/), it's [encouraging the spread of pests](http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/impacts/Global-warming-insects.html#.V0kNOuSWOAA). What's it going to do to us?

Well, we don't know. The most obvious effect will be that even in the best parts of the planet, [you'll be living in the equivalent of a stuffy office](http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/jun252006/1607.pdf), so headaches, general malaise, dizziness, that sort of thing. Other current health effects include [making us stupid](http://www.skepticalscience.com/how-sapiens-in-the-world-of-high-co2-concentration.html) and possibly [fat](https://thesenecaeffect.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/the-effects-of-elevated-carbon-dioxide-on-our-health/).  But long-term exposure causes respiratory acidosis, and we don't know what effects that has over the course of years or decades.[This paper](http://grapevine.com.au/~pbierwirth/co2toxicity.pdf) sums it up nicely.

It's pretty easy to think of a post-collapse future and envision bands of hardy hunter-gatherers, bravely ekeing out a living once civilization has fallen. After all, we've been through periods of climate change before as a species.

We have, but not really well. It looks like there was a period of time where we were down to around 2,000 individuals for [a few thousand years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck). Once you're down that low, survival is a question of luck, and I don't really want to roll the dice on that one twice.

Our hardy band of hunter-gatherers is going to be up against an increase in agricultural pests, an increase in heat, an increase in catastrophic weather events, an increase in diseases, a decrease in food output, a decrease in available potable water, the lingering effects of environmental toxins, and the unknown aftereffects of the decline of civilization. And they're going to have to do it while dealing with severely curtailed brainpower due to increased CO2.

Yes, the human race is adaptable. Yes, we're intelligent. Yes, we've survived a lot so far.

But it's easy to see where we're stacking the deck against the survival of the species. I haven't even gone into the effects of the massive wave of extinctions we're dealing with, or the possibility that as things wind down we'll see the nukes deployed. Hell, I didn't even touch on global dimming.

The damage from all of this is cumulative. Just because we understand some aspects of all of these systems doesn't mean we can predict what happens when we break all of them at once. We have no precedent on which to base predictions of what happens when we put this much carbon and pollutants into the atmosphere of a planet in a short period of time; we can only make educated guesses, and hope for the best.

So if you find yourself reassured by the smooth curves on the IPCC reports and the hubris that we're too smart to be wiped out, please consider the possibility that you've massively underestimated the scope of the problems we're facing.

7ym67z,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: We are Professor Tim Lenton and Dr Damien Mansell from the University of Exeter, here to answer your questions on Solutions to Climate Change. AMA!","Hello, we are Professor Tim Lenton and Dr Damien Mansell, climate scientists from the University of Exeter. Together, our research looks into the science of Climate Change. We’re also passionate educators and have, for the last 5 years, produced free online courses that look at the Challenges and Solutions of climate change. It can be easy to feel disillusioned by climate change and as if there is nothing we can do, but that’s not true and there are many ways we can take action into our own hands. 

Tim: My research has looked at the evolution of the Earth System and, in particular, tipping points in the climate system. I’ve recently begun focussing on detecting early warning signals for these tipping points. If we are able to detect when a system is close to tipping, we can better assess the solutions that can prevent catastrophic climate change or reduce the impacts. 

Damien: I study the contemporary cryosphere (the world’s ice) and how this is changing with recent climate warming. My research uses satellite data and the development of new remote sensing techniques to study cryosphere instabilities. I’m also interested in the use of technology in teaching and education, from developing virtual field trips to these online courses. 

Our new course '[Climate Change: Solutions](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-the-solutions?utm_campaign=university_of_exeter_climate_change_the_solutions_february_2018&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=reddit)' discusses and applies the theme of Climate Action to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We look at a range of solutions, from changing the way we produce energy to the way we farm, and explore where different options might be viable around the world. In particular, we’ll be focussing on the SDGs of Life below Water, Life on Land and Sustainable Cities and Communities. In this AMA, we will be joined by our facilitator team from the University of Exeter to help answer your burning questions about all things solutions! Ask us anything!

We'll be back at 11:00 am ET to answer your questions, Ask us anything!",,69,56.0,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7ym67z/science_ama_series_we_are_professor_tim_lenton/,True,University-of-Exeter,1747630384.579712,climate science,scientific,,

Instead of producing beef, it would be much more efficient to produce 20 kg of organic matter suitable for humans to eat instead (i.e. vegetables etc).

What is the intended use case for cellular agriculture? What is your ultimate objective and how do you think it would work in the society? 

Western societies eat more meat than ever in history and it's so cheap it doesn't even make sense. Also, many people, including me, are moving away from processed food and paying a premium price to eat locally grown food from responsible farms (even if I don't buy ""full"" organic, as I think it's unscientific). How would cellular agriculture products fit into this consumer preferences shift?

For background, in europe you can get ground **beef** for prices lower than 5€/kg!!!! Such a low price doesn't even make sense. From a policy perspective it would make sense to try to make meat production more difficult, so that prices could rise back to levels when families ate beef once a week. 
I'm poor, I decided to buy exclusively unprocessed locally produced food. And I still can afford much more food and meat than it would be healthy!!

dno8fe5,science,scientific,,"Hi, I work as a research assistant in a precision medicine lab, primarily doing stem cell culture. Obviously this work is quite different from what you're doing, but stem cell work and a lot of tissue and cell culture work requires adding a number of antibiotics, hormones, growth factors, cytokines, etc. directly to cell media to promote the growth of the correct cell/tissue type and to prevent infection. A lot of people currently take issue with the use of hormones and antibiotics in commercial meat and dairy - do you think it would be possible to circumvent this problem when creating meat in a dish, or is it unavoidable? Are there certain components of cell media that you are looking to avoid or replace to commercialize these meats? Though I'm sure it's a pretty small amount, I would be particularly concerned because the small molecules, hormones, etc. and all are being added directly to tissue in this case, rather than going through the first-pass metabolism in a live animal. I am also curious if you think there is any potential for using stem cell technologies to creat certain types of tissue/meat?

Congratulations on the article, it's very strong and you address most of the possible sources of endogeneity that came to mind as I read.  I have some questions about land tenure.  I was surprised that, given that most land in Uganda (and SSA on the whole) is held under customary land tenure, you termed the subjects ""private forest owners.""  Did your survey ask respondents whether they have a title to their land?  I ask because of your counter-intuitive result that treated PFOs feel more secure about their ownership after the program; this runs against previous findings that suggest that clearing land for planting crops is a tactic used to secure land tenure when property rights are not well-defined or enforced.  I know you tried to make sure that participants did not select into the program based on anticipated future deforestation; do you worry they selected in based on pre-program strength of their property rights?  In other words, that only landowners who felt relatively secure in their land claims participated?  (Maybe this issue would not be a problem since it would be correlated with levels of anticipated deforestation?)

I'm curious whether or not a transfer value that's set at one point in the year will still impact farmers' behavior in coming years when the price for meat will perhaps rise more steeply throughout the year & therefore provide larger incentives for deforesting later in the year.",,3,,,,,beveridgecurve101,1747624540.676628,climate science,scientific,t3_6s56co,6s56co

My question to you, Seema, is how are these stands of forests being evaluated? How are they being estimated at a cost to NOT be cut down? Are they being roughly estimated at how much labor would cost and the profit yield after the lumber is sold? And if that's the case, (because I know that is expensive) why not just allow the farmers to professionally fell a percentage of these trees that are of mid-high value  (save for old growth trees that may or may not be protected in the specific countries) and foot the bill for established saplings to replace those? That way the lumber market doesn't take a huge hit, the farmers make money, and you are still saving the environment in the long run (which I am 100% for.)

dla9y57,science,scientific,,"Hi and thanks for the AMA. We need elegant methods of handling poverty. 

I'm personally skeptical of aid programs that don't help people lift themselves out of poverty. They don't appear economically sustainable at scale. 

From what I can tell this program does more to protect the forest and chimps than the people living around it. 

Would it not be a better option to help them build some sort of trade or industry that allows them to make a good living? One that doesn't require they destroy forests for extra money? 

Am I misunderstanding the goals of the program or the actual end effects?

dlabnjo,science,scientific,,"Hi Professor, 

1.) Were there any commitment devices used in this study, i.e. if someone breaks contract and deforests, were there penalties? 

2.) Could you see any program where payments increase over time to people who have agreed to the program, as presumably wood supplies run low and the wood becomes more valuable to be cut down?

3.) Does the low participation rate worry you as to how effective this policy could be? You even worked with a local agency, and they were not able to spread the word well. Have you thought about possibly using 'model homes', where locals can see other locals implementing this policy and making their community members aware.

I wanted to know if growing indigenous crops/ farming symbiotically can help achieve the same results that you have shown. 

For example, in India the cash crops tends to be the leading cause of deforestation and imbalances the local ecosystems. Most of the cash crops are not endemic to India (corn, coffee, tea etc). They require large areas of lands and often use all the nutrients in the soil hence killing vegetation in the surrounding areas.  

If we were to grow crops that are indigenous to India (millets, sugarcane) along large tracts of forest land, do you see this as potentially benefitial? If yes, since you have a perspective of the farmers/forest owners mindset, would you think they could be persuaded by paying them?

We’re talking about Cape Town’s dire drought situation, climate change, and how one of the best-managed and wealthiest cities in Africa found itself on the brink of running dry. Ask Us Anything!","My name is Adam Welz and I’m a South Africa-based freelance journalist and contributor to Yale Environment 360 magazine, where I recently published the story, “[Awaiting Day Zero: Cape Town Faces an Uncertain Water Future](https://e360.yale.edu/features/awaiting-day-zero-cape-town-faces-an-uncertain-water-future).” Recently, Cape Town has become infamous as the home of “Day Zero,” the day when most of the city’s taps are predicted to run dry. With its major, rain-fed supply dams dangerously low after three years of drought, most of the city’s 4 million-plus residents — some rich, many desperately poor — have been facing the prospect of lining up at emergency water distribution points to collect a daily ration of just 6.6 gallons per person. Thanks to massive reductions in water usage in recent months, Cape Town recently pushed back its Day Zero, but the region’s drought continues and the city’s water shortage issues are far from over. How did one of the best-managed and wealthiest cities in Africa find itself on the brink of a catastrophic water shortage in the first place, particularly considering climate change and water management have been firmly on the agenda of Cape Town’s leaders for years? What is the city doing to rectify the immediate situation, and at what cost? And with its population growing and the climate warming, how does Cape Town meet its future water needs?

Joining me today are water policy expert Christine Colvin, head of freshwater programs with WWF-South Africa, climate scientist Peter Johnston of the University of Cape Town, and biologist Adam West also of the University of Cape Town.

We’ll be answering your questions starting at 10 am ET — Ask Us Anything!

4nag2c,science,scientific,Science AMA Series: We’re Drs. Jessica Hellmann and Tessa Hill—two scientists who talk to non-scientists about climate change. Ask us anything!,"Hi reddit! We’re Drs. Jessica Hellmann and Tessa Hill and we are here to talk to you about improving how scientists can talk with the public about climate change. 

Climate scientists see firsthand the current and potential impacts of climate change, and often feel compelled to share these scenarios with the public and highlight the way their science intersects with critical societal interests. Yet, even the most capable science communicators can improve how they talk with non-scientists about crucial social and scientific issues in ways that both capture their complexity and move the dialogue forward.

The science of scicomm suggests it’s important to find common ground. There are promising practices developing within scicomm, and many scientists have had communication successes.  We’re here to help you improve your scicomm skills and share our stories from the field—Ask us anything!

This AMA is being facilitated as part of the [AAAS Leshner Leadership Institute](http://www.aaas.org/pes/leshner-leadership-institute), a fellowship program that helps foster scientists’ scicomm and public engagement skills.

[Jessica Hellmann](https://jessicajhellmann.wordpress.com/): I lead the [Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota](http://environment.umn.edu/).  I study global change and was among the first to propose and study new techniques for protecting ecosystems and people from climate change. 

[Tessa Hill](https://hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com/): I am at [UC Davis](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/)  and I study the impact of climate change on the ocean. I am experienced in science communication, including working with teachers and engaging stakeholders. I recently served on the West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Panel.

For background: [Sara K. Yeo’s 2015 paper, “Public Engagement with and Communication of Science in a Web-2.0 Media Environment”](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/content_files/public%20engagement%20social%20media_Yeo_single.pdf) is an excellent literature review of the scicomm field as it applies to social media.  Perhaps nowhere are the insights she collects more needed than when discussing climate change.

I’m Dr. Gerry Bell, a meteorologist in the Climate Prediction Center at NOAA’s National Weather Service, I lead teams of scientists at NOAA who predict the Atlantic, eastern Pacific and central Pacific hurricane seasons every year. Ask Me Anything!","Hello Reddit!


I’m Dr. Gerry Bell, a hurricane climate specialist and research meteorologist with NOAA's National Weather Service at the Climate Prediction Center. My research into the climate factors that control seasonal hurricane activity helped NOAA launch the first seasonal Atlantic hurricane outlook in 1998. Since then, I've been the lead scientist on the team that predicts Atlantic hurricane seasons and lead author of the annual hurricane outlook. I've spent a great deal of my professional career researching, publishing, and lecturing on the science of Atlantic hurricane activity, primarily the factors that fuel or hinder storm development. 


Each year, we monitor global climate patterns and use advanced computer models to predict how many named storms will form in the Atlantic, how many will become hurricanes (Category 1-2), and how many will become major hurricanes (Category 3-5). While our team can't predict how many hurricanes will make landfall, the seasonal outlook provides a general idea of whether the season will be slow or active based on climate patterns running in the background and influencing storm development. It also provides everyone in hurricane-prone areas with a great opportunity to get prepared.


On May 27, in fact, we issued our 2016 Atlantic hurricane season outlook. It calls for a near-normal season with a 70-percent likelihood of 10-16 named storms and 4-8 hurricanes, of which 1-4 could be major hurricanes. The announcement is available on NOAA.gov at http://www.noaa.gov/near-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-most-likely-year.


I’ll be here from 1:00 pm EDT to 3:00 pm EDT today answering your questions about our predictions for this year and the science behind how we make those predictions … AMA!

----------------------------------------------------

3:15 pm ET

Wow, two hours went by fast!  Thank you for your interest in science, and especially the science of seasonal hurricane forecasting. You asked some great questions, and I enjoyed this opportunity to connect with you and share information about my passion for hurricanes, climate, and hurricane season predictions. I have to put in a very important parting plug for preparedness ... 

Regardless of our outlook, it only takes one landfalling hurricane to devastate a community and change lives forever. Now is the time to get prepared for the 2016 hurricane season — do it before the storms threaten and stay safe this hurricane season. Below are some links to information I know you will find useful in preparing yourself and your family for the hurricane season. Until next time!

Ask Me Anything!","I am Mike Ellis, head of climate change and landscape change science at the British Geological Survey in the UK, an editor of the [AGU journal Earth’s Future](http://tinyurl.com/hso4tdg) and a member of the [Anthropocene Working Group (AWG)](http://tinyurl.com/lhpzlrp). The AWG is an international group of scientists and experts convened by the International Commission on Stratigraphy -- the governing body of all things related to the Earth’s chronology – to study whether human activity has driven Earth into a new geological age. The group is examining the question of whether the proposed Anthropocene can be defined by a globally distributed signal, a marker of some sort that has the potential to be a permanent part of Earth’s history.

The AWG will present its progress and recommendations at the International Geological Congress in South Africa in August, with a formal proposal to follow at some time in the future. No one disagrees with the fundamental proposition that humans have had and continue to have a significant impact on the Earth, and a consensus is rapidly developing for marking the change to a new geological age in the mid-20th Century. [I co-authored a study](http://tinyurl.com/zdsy4u5)  the topic in the AGU journal Earth’s Future earlier this year ([and here’s another related article](http://tinyurl.com/z6qg9z6) published in Science earlier this year). I’ve also written about the moral implications of the Anthropocene with philosopher Zev Trachtenberg from the University of Oklahoma ([also published in Earth’s Future](http://tinyurl.com/hxa6lsh)). There are, in fact, many interesting questions that spin off from the proposition of an Anthropocene and go beyond the issue of when precisely it began. One of those questions that I am tackling is how do we formally engage the role of humans in predictive models of Earth’s future?

I hope to answer lots of interesting questions about the impacts of climate change and the Anthropocene during the AGU AMA! See you all soon!

4ql4r7,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: Hi, we’re NOAA scientists Jennifer Koss, Mark Eakin, and Randy Kosaki. We are here to talk about the global coral bleaching event that we are experiencing right now. Ask Us Anything!","Hi Reddit! I’m [Jennifer Koss](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/profiles/dec13/koss.html), director of the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program. I’m [Mark Eakin](http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/Eakin_M.php), a coral scientist with the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program and coordinator for NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch. And I’m [Randy Kosaki](http://www.hawaiianatolls.org/research/NOWRAMP2002/interviews/dr_randy_kosaki.php), deputy superintendent for research and field operations at the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.

We’re here to answers your questions on the longest global coral bleaching event on record and what we can, and are, doing to help. 

Did you know that in October 2015, NOAA declared the third ever global coral bleaching event on record? Since then, we’ve reported that it could extend well into 2017. This bleaching event is hitting U.S. coral reefs disproportionately hard. Here at NOAA, we estimate that as of March 31, 2016, all U.S. coral reefs have been exposed to ocean conditions that can cause corals to bleach.

Coral bleaching and disease, brought on by climate change and coupled with events like the current El Niño, are the largest and most pervasive threats to coral reefs around the world. 

While this news has us worried, don’t count corals out! They are remarkably resilient organisms. Here at NOAA we are working with marine resource managers and communities all over the US and internationally to reduce local stressors—like fishing pressure and pollution—to promote reef health and help these amazing creatures resist or recover from bleaching events. 

We’re here today to discuss the latest information on this bleaching event, what happens to corals when they bleach, explore what this all means, and identify what NOAA scientists are doing to address this threat.

Many big orgs coordinating. Link and info in comments.","WE NEED TO ORGANIZE UNDER ONE UMBRELLA TO SHOW REAL POWER.

Hi I’m an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march:

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? 
________

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let’s take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn’t happen. Game over.

_________

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they’re at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and … ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

__________
REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

______________
MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There’s a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

I'm out here on a boat off the coast of Antarctica with other scientists who are studying different aspects of the Southern Ocean. In my usual work, I try to communicate the facts about climate change (causes and effects) at Climate Central. As part of that mission, I'm following three science projects that are focused on the state of the Southern Ocean and how it will change in the future. 

One group is studying ocean physics along the shelf of the Amundsen Sea; one group studies the microbiology and consequent evolution of the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean, and one group (SOCCOM) studies the carbon chemistry of the Southern Ocean and how it will change in the future.

With me are the following scientists: 


[Professor Stephen Riser](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Stephen+Riser) is a Professor of Physical Oceanography at the University of Washington, interested in the ocean's role in climate, and in deducing the general circulation of the ocean and ocean/atmosphere/ice interactions through direct observations of the ocean circulation.


[Caitlin Whalen, PhD](http://www.apl.washington.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Whalen&first_name=Caitlin) of the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is an expert in ocean mixing. 


[Professor Tatiana Rynearson](http://www.gso.uri.edu/profile/rynearson/) from U. of Rhode Island: My area of research is in marine genomics and population genetics. My goals are to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping genetic diversity in the plankton and to examine how those processes affect plankton community structure, function and productivity in coastal regions. My approach is to identify and exploit the genetic variation that exists within and between individuals to examine how plankton respond to their environment.


[Professor Sinead Collins](http://www.smallbutmighty.bio.ed.ac.uk/) from the U. of Edinburgh:

 I'm interested in how large populations of small organisms adapt to complex environmental changes. Since that's a bit too vague, I focus on how marine phytoplankton adapt to ocean acidification. I use experimental evolution in the lab to figure out the basic theory involved, and then head off to collaborate with oceanographers to apply it to marine systems.

5iha6f,science,scientific,"Science AMA series: I'm Brian Buma, Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska. I study forest disturbances around the world, focusing on emerging mortality associated with climate change and carbon/water/forests as an integrated system. AMA!","Hi reddit!

I am a disturbance ecologist (think fires, windstorms, landslides) that primarily studies the response of forested ecosystems to emerging disturbances triggered by climate change.  I'm particularly interested in how resilient forests may be to these new stresses - and if that resilience is a good thing.  Will our forests recover from future disturbances?  What will that recovery look like?  Does this recovery – or lack thereof – help or hinder species ability to migrate in response to climate change?  What new disturbances are emerging?  

One striking example of all of these issues is the emerging mortality of species along the remote southeast Alaskan and Canadian west coast, where 400,000 ha (so far) of trees have died due to low snow conditions brought about by warming winters.  The cause is surprisingly related to freezing – the soil is no longer insulated by snow, so cold snaps can kill.  This is an emerging disturbance that we are just beginning to study, and it’s dramatically changing the forest community.  But it also appears to be associated with migration in other, less climate sensitive species.  So perhaps this disturbance, and others, are facilitating the migration of species into more favorable climates.  It’s a complex ecological story of adaption/maladaptation and creative destruction (so to speak), and great fun to investigate.

Most of my work involves a focus on either forest biodiversity, forest carbon, or water resources, and I've worked in Hawaii, the Rocky Mountains, and Alaska, and collaborated on projects around the world using a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing/satellites, GIS, and modeling.  I am also the caretaker of what is believed to be the longest running permanent study plots studying primary succession in the world in Glacier Bay, Alaska (100 years and counting).  So the data comes from a lot of sources, and I'm happy to discuss integration of methods as well.

We're Dr. Joe Levy and  Cassie Stuurman—we study geological systems in cold regions on Earth to try to understand the evolution of the surface of Mars and how cold landscapes on Earth record evidence of climate change.


Ice is one of the most important, but least appreciated geological materials. It flows and melts when local climate conditions are warm, and piles up when conditions are cold. You can drink it, measure the chemical fingerprint of past ice ages locked away in it, and even look for modern and ancient microbial life in it. So how do we use planetary analogs on Earth to understand surface processes on Mars? Where is the ice on Mars? How similar is it to glacial and permafrost landforms on Earth? What kind of changes to the surface of Mars and Earth have been wrought by changing climate over the last few million years? How are we going to use ice on Mars when humans begin to settle on that planet?

5io7sh,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: Hi, we're editors and writers at Science Magazine, currently working on the Breakthrough of the Year issue. Ask us anything!","Hi reddit!
 
2016 was an amazing year for science, and much of the breakthrough research appeared in the pages (both physical and digital) of Science Magazine.  Now, we're working on a special end-of-year issue that will bestow upon one scientific achievement the title of ""Breakthrough of the Year.""
 
Every December, Science magazine announces a Breakthrough of the Year and a short list of runners-up. We, the writers and editors, comb through the year’s scientific advances--with help from the Board of Reviewing Editors and other scientists--and judge which have done the most to benefit humanity, answer long-standing questions, or pave the way for fruitful new research.
 
It’s a tricky task. Many discoveries take years to catch fire; others seem exciting but never fulfill their promise. And even when something big happens in science, it’s not always obvious exactly when and where the “breakthrough” took place. Here is our list of ""greatest hits.""
 
All that said, we also have [People's Choice award](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/vote-your-scientific-breakthrough-year), and this year, we wanted to come to Reddit to talk about the year in science and what you think might deserve the Breakthrough of the Year award.
 
Ask us anything!

9147zw,climatechange,action-oriented,A science parable of diet and climate change,"Energy is something every life form needs, every moment of every day.  Humans get our energy by eating food and combusting it to carbon dioxide and water. It is estimated that 1 in 8 people of the world do not get enough to eat (that’s 815 million people) and 36 million people starve to death every year. On the other hand, about 2/3 of Americans are overweight or obese. 

Let’s say you wanted to figure out what were your daily calorie needs, so you could live a healthy life. Too few calories and you are underweight; too many calories and you are overweight. To determine this scientifically, you would have to start keeping a record of every type and precise amount of food and drink you consumed every day to know exactly how many calories went into our body. As a good scientist, you might want to consider additional variables such as how much protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and fiber you consumed, but for this example let’s go with just the calories. You would also have to keep a record of all of your daily activities every day to know how many calories you burned. In other words, you would have to become scientist and collect a lot of data over an extended period of time. 

So many factors make it all sort of complicated, so you might need to do different versions of this experiment, limiting the variables in any one experiment. A single day’s worth of data would not answer the question. Even one week of data would not be enough, because of natural fluctuations that occur in life. How much water do you drink, how much sweat do you lose, when do you go to the bathroom and what time of the day is it? Did you weigh yourself when you woke up or after a meal, with your clothes on or off? Is it a holiday celebration or a busy workday? As you can see there are many variables. That’s the way it is in most science experiments. It’s not like flipping a coin and seeing heads or tails. 

Let’s say you started off with a healthy weight of 130 pounds and found that after one month of data that your body required 2,000 calories to maintain that body weight. Now, the way we use the word calorie in foods is a bit misleading. A food calorie is really a kilocalorie (kilo means 1,000). So a food calorie is really 1,000 small calories. As a scientist, you need to know that a small calorie is the amount of heat (energy) that will raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius. In American units, that is about 1/28th of an ounce, 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That means 1 kilocalorie (1 food calorie) would equal heating 1,000 grams of water (about 2.2 pounds) 1 degree Celsius. That is the same as 1 liter of water, which is about 1 quart of water (1 liter = 1.1 quart). When you think about it, 2,000 food calories is a lot of energy. That would be equal to heating 2,000 liters of water (4,400 pounds of water) 1 degree Celsius or heating 1 liter of water (2.2 pounds), 2,000 degrees Celsius (of course, it wouldn’t be water any more, it would be steam). Assume you limit yourself to 2,000 calories a day for an entire year, and keep your same exercise schedule and your weight doesn’t fluctuate a single pound. You have used science to improve your life. 

Now, suppose a friend came over and introduces you to Oreo cookies. You love them and start eating 1 Oreo cookie every day as a treat. In case you were wondering, an Oreo cookie has 45 calories, which is composed of 27 calories of carbohydrates, 16.5 calories of fat and 1.5 calories of protein (data from the research of other scientists). Let’s just say that an Oreo cookie has 50 calories to simplify our calculations. You look up in the literature and discover that there are 3,500 food calories in a pound. (Notice that you are trusting accepted results of other scientists.) You know what is going to happen. You start eating 2,050 calories a day, which is 50 calories over what you body needs to stay at 130 pounds and you are no longer in energy balance. This doesn’t seem like a big deal because 50 calories is hardly anything, and besides you wouldn’t even notice if you gained an extra pound. After all, how long would it take to gain 1 pound? That turns out to be a simple calculation. It would take 70 days.

1 extra pound = (3,500 calories)x(1 Orea/50 calories)x(1 day/1 Oreo) = 70 days to gain 1 pound

Let’s say this becomes a habit that you don’t stop for 10 years. You keep recording your calories, exercise and weight and this is what the data might look like at 2050 calories per day. 

extra weight in year 1 = (365 days)x(1 pound/70 days) = 5.2 pounds

year 0 = 130 pounds

year 1 = 135 pounds

year 2 = 140 pounds

year 3 = 145 pounds

year 4 = 150 pounds

year 5 = 155 pounds

year 6 = 160 pounds

year 7 = 165 pounds

year 8 = 170 pounds

year 9 = 175 pounds

year 10 = 180 pounds

You might think your basal metabolism would go up because you are carrying more weight, but you also might become less active because you are carrying more weight. Those are other variables that would have to be determined scientifically. Let’s assume they cancel in this parable.

Even though 50 calories is not very much, and you might not even notice the extra pounds at the beginning, the fact that it continues for 3,650 days adds up to an extra 50 pounds of body weight. You might start to notice after a year or two. There are additional downsides of gaining so much weight, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and more. It was just one little cookie a day that got you into this potentially life-threatening situation. 

You know what should have happened. You could have eaten 50 calories less in our daily diet, or you could eat 350 calories less one day a week, or you could exercise 50 extra calories every day. There are lots of ways you could modify your lifestyle to eat the 1 Oreo a day if you understand the energy inputs and outputs. If you did happen to find yourself 50 pounds overweight, you would have (50 pounds)x(3500 calories/pound) = 175,000 calories to lose. You couldn’t lose that weight in a day, a week or a month. If you completely quit eating, and still had a basal metabolism of 2,000 calories per day, it would take us about 73 days to lose 50 pounds. That’s over 2 months of starvation. Of course, when you starve yourself, your body slows its metabolic weight to try and keep you alive, which means it would actually take longer because the calories you burn go down. Also, your body starts to break down protein to maintain glucose levels so your brain cells don’t die. If the protein comes from your heart, it might stop beating and you would die. Starvation is a very poor strategy to achieve a long term healthy lifestyle. If you cut out 500 calories a day, it would take about one year to lose the 50 pounds. That means, no cheating every day for a year. You would need discipline of steal. 

And that’s what’s needed to address climate change. Carbon dioxide, methane and other gases are the calories.  The life-threatening outcomes include increasing temperatures, sea level rise flooding coastal cities and salt water corruption of water tables, deltas and rivers. Increasing ocean acidity will devastate corals and other sea life. Expect more severe droughts, fires and storm events and, very sadly, loss of animal diversity. Instead of thinking in days, weeks and months, think of decades, centuries and millennia. Maybe you are too old to care what happens. Or maybe you have kids and grandkids and even the unborn that you hope will have a good life. 

The odds of many of the tragic events of climate change are way higher than the odds of flying on a plane with a terrorist present. Yet, think about the inconvenience and expense you allow for the plane versus the effort you are willing to put forth to protect the future of humanity and other life on earth. Is it a weekend at Las Vegas, or is it a matter of life and death?

8w4tvr,sustainability,action-oriented,Signs of collapse 2018 Q2,"Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.
 
I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.
 
I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

47uhwf,collapse,skeptical,How I remember Climate Change,"If you've been paying attention to the media reports on climate change for the past 10-20 years, you've probably noticed a very peculiar change in the narrative. John Michael Greer has touched upon this in [some of his blog posts](http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.nl/2015/12/too-little-too-late.html) a few weeks ago, but I figured it's worth pointing out here as well. To me it's starting to feel like I come from a different timeline that was merged into this timeline, because the entire narrative seems to have changed.

Back when I was in high school, the idea of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere wasn't there. Removing it was said to be impossible. Once it's in the atmosphere, we have to deal with it. Today, every major projection by the IPCC seems to feature this idea that we're somehow going to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Once it became necessary to meet the two degree target, it seems to have turned from something impossible in the minds of people into something we'll eventually figure out somehow.

This brings me to another issue, the fact that I remember the two degree target being paraded in the media very differently. The two degree target was difficult, sure, but it was necessary. We couldn't settle for a higher target, because once we move beyond two degree, feedbacks were supposed to kick in that take the change out of our control and ensure that the planet continues to change on its own trajectory, regardless of what we might do. 

There were all sorts of feedbacks we were told about that would start to kick in above 2 degree Celsius. The ocean would warm up and as a result of warming up it would start emitting CO2, rather than absorbing CO2. The arctic sea ice would melt and as a result, temperatures would increase further due to the albedo effect. The same things would happen to the tundra, where snow would melt and methane would be released from the permafrost due to thawing vegetation. Eventually, wildfires would kick in that would destroy our forests, released carbon from the burning trees and the soils, etcetera. 

Thus, the point that was always argued was that it's two degree or nothing. A higher target was irrelevant, because a higher target would merely buy us some time, as the feedbacks kick in and we're left with a very different world. But today, I regularly see news articles arguing to raise the target to [2.5 or 3 degree](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/climate-change-target-of-two-degrees-celsius-needs-revision-a-904219.html), or abandon a target altogether. Even in Nature, [we find prominent scientists calling for abandoning the 2 degree target.](http://www.nature.com/news/climate-policy-ditch-the-2-c-warming-goal-1.16018)

The entire narrative seems to have changed from one of man rolling a ball of snow down a snowy mountain, towards one of man carefully tuning the button on his thermostat. Meanwhile the apocalyptic predictions we were warned about are now here, but nobody is talking about them. Instead of all the people who warned about this stuff saying ""See, I told you so!"" like you might expect, they don't wish to talk about it anymore and these have now become fringe issues.

Massive wildfires in Indonesia destroy the remaining forests, but it's never really mentioned as being a consequence of climate change and a positive feedback, rather it's attributed solely to the locals who burn everything down and make their own cities uninhabitabl in the process. The [explosions in Siberia](http://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/climate-change/russian-scientist-warns-methane-explosions-a-threat-to-siberian-cities/news-story/1ba63cdafe5b365d48145116b02fae01) creating massive craters in the ground due to methane eruptions are not really discussed. Rapidly [growing spikes in atmospheric methane are detected](http://robertscribbler.com/2016/02/26/2-c-coming-on-faster-than-we-feared-atmospheric-methane-spikes-to-record-3000-parts-per-billion), but there's no real talk about this in the media, it's delegated to a number of fringe blogs and mainstream climatologists don't seem to want to touch it and there seems to be no official acknowledgement that this is even happening from them.

I have a good idea how they work, converting CO and HC into CO2 and H20, and some of the three or four way converters can convert NOx into less harmful oxides.  I have a couple questions related to combustion engines.

* Is there a practical way for there to be a converter of some sort put on exhaust stacks for power plants, or potentially a converter on a jet engine, cruise ships, and container ships?  The automotive industry in the US has pretty strict emissions standards, where the aviation and maritime industry does not.

* Is there a way for these converters to eliminate CO and CO2 from exiting the exhaust of combustion in a car, power plant, or cargo/container ships so we eliminate those as sources for CO2 completely?  Is it possible for a converter to capture or convert all the CO2 from a combustion engine?

* Is there a way through chemistry that we can use an additive in gasoline, diesel, Jet A, Jet A-1, or heavy fuel oil to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted by burning these fuels?

I sometimes like to go on the NOAA site on occasion to look at interesting statistics and trends for fun sometimes.

This September has been _exceptionally_ wet for the US.  Particularly in the Midwest, where I'm at, it's causing quite a few problems for farmers who would have, in the past, normally have liked to be harvesting around now.  These farmers got into the fields late this year on account of excessive flooding and wet fields that were not ready for planting.  A lot of fields had standing water in them.  Now that it is harvest season, farmers are running into the same problem they did last year.  Last September we in our area, had 4 times our normal precipitation rate.  This year, throughout the US in September while the monthly totals aren't in yet, the largest daily accumulations of rainfalls for September are insane again.  

https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/records

My question is: I know weather doesn't directly represent climate, are the wetter springs and falls going to be more normal in the future in the midwest (along with drier in the west)?  What sorts of weather changes are predicted in the US expect in the next 15-20 years if current trends continue?  In the next 50 years, and in the next 100 years?

I think my question is best suited to Dr. Dukes or Dr. Cloyd, what are your thoughts on the 'micro vs macro' drivers of climate change? 

Specifically, in my understanding, if a relatively small area, such as that surrounding a human settlement or industry, has substantial change in vegetation/albedo/local emissions this area is far more likely to experience effects which are likely to be ascribed to 'climate change'. This is accurate in that the climate has changed but innaccurate in that the reduction of global atmospheric carbon is not going to help the degraded local environment and as such is not likely to reduce the immediate impacts of climate change that these areas are experiencing.

f0vo2ht,science,scientific,,"An article caught my attention yesterday because Cory Booker advocated for nuclear power in addition to expanding renewables. The article contained some interesting information regarding how significant nuclear power is in aiding our transition away from fossil fuels that I had never seen before. Here is a summary:

-	in order for renewables to replace coal and natural gas plants by 2050 renewables must grow an average of 2% per year (currently they average 0.6%, according to the article)
-	if we simultaneously increase the number of electric vehicles on the roads to replace ICE vehicles we would need to double total capacity which would require a growth in renewable energy more than 7 times the current rate (presumably the article means replacing all ICEs, but it does not specify)
-	if we phase out nuclear plants by 2035 this increases the required growth rate of renewables to 17x current rates
-	if we decommissioned nuclear plants immediately the growth rate for renewables becomes 25x current rates

I didn’t see any source for these specific statistics. Does this information seem accurate? Where do you see nuclear power fitting in while we transition away from coal and natural gas? 

Based on the article we are nowhere close to the required growth rate for renewable energy to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050, how do we start to close that gap and make up for the deficit? What do you think is the primary reason we have not achieved the rate required?

Source of reading on my interest of the historical North American climate.

https://www2.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html
The images presented here show the paleogeography of North America over the last 550 million years of geologic history. The 40 images shown here are selected from a suite of approximately 100 maps that are in time slices mostly 5-10 million years apart. By using such tightly spaced time slices, individual paleogeographic and tectonic elements can be followed and intuitively related from time slice to adjacent time slice. Because of space limitations only 40 of the 100 images are presented here but but most shifts of tectonic elements and depositional systems can still be followed. The maps were prepared with the core of North America (Laurentia) fixed. All other tectonic elements are shown moving against or splitting away from Laurentia, thus showing clearly accretionary and rifting events in North America's geologic history. The views were prepared by wrapping a rectangular outline map on a sphere and viewing the globe rotated to 35° N and 100° W. Various stratigraphic, tectonic, and sedimentologic data were added to the map. Topography was ""cloned"" from digital elevation maps of modern Earth from the USGS, NOAA, and other sources. Colors were adjusted to portray climate and vegetation for the given time and location. The geologic data were gathered from the references listed below.

ctptwvi,science,scientific,,">most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. 

This seems to be a very important distinction, and I'm amazed that the observation that the models and observations were actually showing different measurements has not been made public before this.  

There has been a claim that most of the warming i the last 15 to 18 years has gone into the oceans below the surface, and that's why the models and observations have diverged over that time period.  There are models of projected sea temperature changes, and I believe those models do not model the air 2 meters above, but actual water temperatures. 

Given that the models that we are normally presented with have historically depicted air temperatures, and 71% of the planet is ocean, where air temperatures are not measured, but water temperatures are, and given that we know that the ocean depths are warming, but water takes a lot more energy per unit temperature change, is the current use of air temperature at the surface in any way a reasonable way to depict Climate Change?  

The biggest, most often used warning issued by Climate Scientists and activists is that the world will warm by 3º ± 1.5º C after a doubling of CO2.  But, is that ""air temperature, 2 meters off the ground?"" and if we're not measuring the air temperature, 2 meters off the ground for most of the planet, should we be using a different warning altogether?

Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are not a significant driver of global warming.  CO2 gas holds far less energy/heat than water vapor, and water vapor of course is present in staggering amounts in our atmosphere. So basically all the CO2 we've put into the air is a mere drop in the bucket and insignificant in driving climate change.

The primary driver of climate change is essentially cities, buildings, roads, parking lots, etc which absorb an absurdly high amount of solar radiation when compared to the plant life that would have been in it's place.

So he is saying that humans drive climate change but we are erroneously fixated on CO2 because the graphs people make linking CO2 and global mean heat seem to correlate; an example of correlation but not causation.

Cowspiracy is a documentary highlighting the massive environmental problem animal agriculture is.

It seem a big part of the solution ,  is to provide  plant-based food for all communities in a efficient manner and stop subsidizing factory farming, and  create jobs growing food everywhere possible. Plant trees where crops are now subsidized to be grown to feed these farmed animals. Restore our planet back to its natural state because the balance is lost due to humanities selfish and barbaric behavior. We are not living within the laws of nature. Consuming flesh, stealing milk from babies, caging animals etc , is barbaric, subsidizing it is insane. Our reliance on animals as food needs to stop and a massive movement to grow plants within the laws of nature needs to happen now.  Are you aware of the massive environmental problem Animal Agriculture is and the effect it is having?

According to Wise's calculations linked to above, if we want to stop climate change, but also want 9 billion people by 2050 to have the standard of living the EU has in 2007, CO2 per dollar of GDP will have to decline from 768 in 2007, to just 14 grams per dollar by 2050.

That looks really difficult to me on first sight, so I have the following questions:

Is it really possible to reconcile the desire for economic growth with the desire to address climate change?

As both a moderator here and somebody who frequently spends (perhaps ""wastes"") a lot of timing debating with climate change deniers online, it's clear to see that many of the online commenters are just the tip of a mass media effort to redefine climate change as a political argument in order to detract from the science and make the implications of climate change something to dismiss as socialist/liberal alarmism. Many popular mass media publications regularly ridicule the scientists and science of climate change, and anyone that accepts the science in general, all the while driving home the point that it's a political issue, not a scientific or even societal one. Then reaching further up the ladder, we see entire political parties express almost venomous hate toward anything climate science, while even the governments that claim to believe the science are still mostly allowing and often encouraging fossil fuel explorations.

The plan to *prevent* meaningful action on climate change does appear to have been an enormous success.

So, my main question is, what will it take to change this?

Protesting and writing letters to our representatives doesn't appear to have done enough so far. Often it seems that people are even more politically entrenched in their opposition to climate change actions nowadays than a decade ago. Almost every national and international scientific institution has declared that climate change is real and caused by human activities, thousands of scientific reports and papers are published every year, evidence is constantly accumulating to show that we are the cause and things are already becoming unstable, yet here we still are, applying all this work and effort only for our wheels to continue spinning in the mud.

Other climate scientists like Michael Mann have advocated for an [economic mobilization on the scale of the American World War II mobilization](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org) to eliminate and withdraw excess greenhouse gas emissions, and a growing number of people, including CCL founder Marshall Saunders, are [signing a pledge](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/notable_pledge_signers) to endorse this platform and build toward the massive political will necessary to achieve it in the U.S.

By which I mean, possibly many areas will experience increased drought, possibly many areas will experience increased storm frequency and intensity, possibly many species in the oceans would die from increased acidification, and consequently we would probably see drastically reduced biodiversity.

However, none of the above necessarily entails that *many human lives would be lost* due to climate change, which is what most people care about. Drought is handled by transportation or relocation, storms are handled by construction or relocation, and loss of biodiversity is handled by our reliance on agriculture. So even if climate engineering were to fail, our other means of mitigating the problems aren't necessarily inapplicable simply because the climate changes. Would you agree with this assessment? I think this belief that humans aren't really at risk may hold many people back from endorsing swift and immediate change.

I endorse change simply because tens of thousands of people per year *already die* from air pollution in the US alone, which is a *real and quantifiable cost* we're paying right now.

My question is about the climate thresholds.

Further, by using this global MODIS NPP dataset, you are mixing productivity of many different kinds of vegetation. For example, the climate thresholds for a cornfield in Iowa are probably different than those of a patch of Amazon forest. 

It seems like you could do a similar analysis (possibly more informative) using thresholds for specific regions and vegetation types. **Could you could rerun the analysis by dominant vegetation type (using vegetation-type specific thresholds) and show that say corn productivity will likely rise in the Midwest but soy productivity will decline in Brazil?** I'm sure you've thought of this, but I just wonder if it's feasible.",,5,,,,,thigmotroph,1747602220.563798,climate science,scientific,t3_3hkoun,3hkoun

Posted by RichardBetts on 11 Jun 2015 at 15:27 GMT --on PLOS Biology.

One of the other very odd things about this paper is how the authors have decided that it is legitimate to ""adjust"" the net primary productivity (NPP) projections from the CMIP5 models on the basis of the so-called ""unsuitable plant growth days"" which have been diagnosed from the CMIP5 climate. Irrespective of Colin Prentice's and Trevor Keenan's concerns (which I share) about the validity of these ""unsuitable days"", this seems like double-counting of climate change impacts.

The CMIP5 NPP simulations *already* take account of meteorological factors, often on a much finer timescale than Mora et al, and certainly in a way which is process-based as opposed to correlations. The HadGEM2-ES model, for example, uses meteorological and hydrological quantities on time steps of less than one hour to drive the NPP calculations. This means that the model is already not allowing plants to grow when it's too hot, dry etc. This is already factored in to the CMIP5 NPP projections. For these projections to then be adjusted further on the basis of a second (and less sophisticated) interpretation of the meteorology is giving undue weight to the unfavourable conditions.

I also find it strange that the authors pick and choose which components of the CMIP5 models they will use, without realising that all the components interact. They are somewhat dismissive of CO2 effects on plants when it comes to their effects on growth, but overlook the fact that these effects also contribute to the climate change itself through the surface energy and moisture budget. Warming over land is projected to be larger because of CO2 effects on vegetation, and this also affects evaporation and precipitation. By discarding the CO2 effects in one part of the system but not the other, the authors are introducing an inconsistency.

How (not?) to estimate changes in the suitability of days for plant growth

Posted by colinprentice on 11 Jun 2015 at 10:47 GMT

Implications of global environmental change for the growth of plants (whether as natural ecosystems, managed forests, or crops) are a hot topic. Key aspects, such as the control of leaf canopy temperatures, the ability of plants to acclimate to high temperatures, and the effectiveness of CO2 ""fertilization"" and water saving by plants at high CO2 under different environmental conditions, are incompletely understood. There are obvious concerns, for example, for regions that are undergoing increasing drought and where this trend is projected to continue, and about the major geographic changes in global agriculture that will be necessary if ""high-end"" climate change projections come about.

This paper attempts to cut through these complexities by means of an empirical analysis of net primary production (NPP) derived from satellite observations. The results are dramatically more pessimistic than previously published analyses obtained with Earth System models, which have many of their own uncertainties and problems. However, there are good reasons to suspect that these new results are strongly biased towards a ""glass half empty"" interpretation of the evidence. In summary:

1. The specific method adopted implicitly assumes that climate combinations that are rare today are unsuitable for plant growth. So for example, projected future increases in temperature and rainfall together might create novel environments that would be suitable for plant growth, but the method assumes they are not suitable. This approach produces some strange but presumably significant side-effects, such as an upper temperature threshold that is below the optimum for photosynthesis as observed in many species.

2. The quantity analysed, called MODIS NPP, is not a measurement of NPP. It is a model of NPP, that has previously been criticized for the way in which it treats plant respiration, which tends to exacerbate the modelled effects of warming on NPP.

3. The approach assumes that any positive effects of CO2 concentration on growth or water use by plants do not exist. This is one extreme position on a continuing controversy. The authors refer to an ""over-emphasis"" on CO2 fertilization in current Earth System models, but they do not present evidence for their view which is, as far as I know, impossible to reconcile with the continuing and strong uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the land.

I'm glad that there are people in the industry like you who seem to be very level headed on the issue, but I also think that there are some general issues with farming trends that Organic farming purportedly improves. In the 100% profit driven market of farming that we see in the US, there doesn't seem to be a huge push for improving nutritional value of foods. I think the rise of mono-cultures in farming is probably a bad thing (how many of those diseases/plights from that TED talk might have been mitigated if we had greater biodiversity, do we know?). I think that farmers are still given incentive to inefficiently fertilize (e.g. getting the last 5% yield requires 50% more fertilizer but the economics still work out), leading to massive ocean dead zones which do nothing to the farmers profits but has a large societal costs (and costs to fishing industry).  I like that organics promote seasonal and local consumption, which I've been hearing more about the benefits of lately.

My question is, How do I support these sorts of improvements in agriculture in a way that doesn't blindly support organic farming, including it's demerits. I currently subscribe to a CSA and I think it is the best I can do. I assume they use organic methods for farming and strive for minimalist impact on the land. It also avoids a large amount of food waste from distributors, even if I do receive some strange looking fruits/veggies on occasion.

AMA!","Hi Reddit,

We're Margaret Kosmala and Koen Hufkens at Harvard University and Josh Gray at Boston University. We're part of a research group that has been putting automated cameras on weather towers and other elevated platforms to study the the seasonal timing of changes in plants, shrubs, and trees – called 'phenology'. Because this timing of when plants leaf, flower, and fruit is very sensitive to changes in weather, plant phenology alerts us to changing climate patterns. Our network of about 300 cameras ('PhenoCams') take pictures of vegetated landscapes every half hour, every day, all year round. (That's a lot of pictures!) With the data from these images we can figure the relationships between plant phenology and local weather and then predict the effects of future climate using models. 

We also use images from satellites to broaden the extent of our analyses beyond the 300 specific sites where we have cameras. And we use citizen science to help turn our PhenoCam images into usable data, through our [Season Spotter project](http://seasonspotter.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit). Anyone can go to Season Spotter and answer a few short questions about an image to help us better interpret the image. Right now we are running a “spring challenge” to classify 9,500 images of springtime.

My name is [Wan Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/wanyangblog/), and I am an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University’s [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). I use mathematical and statistical methods to study how infectious diseases (e.g. influenza and Ebola) spread through populations and develop methods to predict them.


My colleagues and I published a paper, [""Forecasting Influenza Epidemics in Hong Kong""](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004383) in the journal [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/). Hong Kong has a humid subtropical climate and is a known global epicenter for flu. Unlike the U.S., where flu is seasonal, the timing of flu outbreaks in Hong Kong and similar climates is highly irregular—making prediction particularly challenging. Using data from 1998 to 2013, we developed two forecast systems for Hong Kong. We were able to predict the timing and magnitude of flu epidemics and the 2009 pandemic with accuracy near that achieved for the U.S.<http://cpid.iri.columbia.edu/> Our findings suggest that forecast of irregular infectious disease epidemics (e.g. the flu epidemics in Hong Kong) is possible.

8pd53m,science,scientific,MEGATHREAD: NASA’s Curiosity rover has found new evidence preserved in rocks on Mars that suggests the planet could have supported ancient life,"Copying directly from the [press release](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-finds-ancient-organic-material-mysterious-methane-on-mars):

In two just-published papers in the journal *Science* ([1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1093),[2](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1096)), NASA’s Curiosity rover has found new evidence preserved in rocks on Mars that suggests the planet could have supported ancient life, as well as new evidence in the Martian atmosphere that relates to the search for current life on the Red Planet. While not necessarily evidence of life itself, these findings are a good sign for future missions exploring the planet’s surface and subsurface.

The new findings – “tough” organic molecules in three-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks near the surface, as well as seasonal variations in the levels of methane in the atmosphere – appear in the June 8 edition of the journal Science.

Organic molecules contain carbon and hydrogen, and also may include oxygen, nitrogen and other elements. While commonly associated with life, organic molecules also can be created by non-biological processes and are not necessarily indicators of life. 

“With these new findings, Mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, in Washington. “I’m confident that our ongoing and planned missions will unlock even more breathtaking discoveries on the Red Planet.”

“Curiosity has not determined the source of the organic molecules,” said Jen Eigenbrode of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is lead author of one of the two new Science papers. “Whether it holds a record of ancient life, was food for life, or has existed in the absence of life, organic matter in Martian materials holds chemical clues to planetary conditions and processes.”

Although the surface of Mars is inhospitable today, there is clear evidence that in the distant past, the Martian climate allowed liquid water – an essential ingredient for life as we know it – to pool at the surface. Data from Curiosity reveal that billions of years ago, a water lake inside Gale Crater held all the ingredients necessary for life, including chemical building blocks and energy sources. 

“The Martian surface is exposed to radiation from space. Both radiation and harsh chemicals break down organic matter,” said Eigenbrode. “Finding ancient organic molecules in the top five centimeters of rock that was deposited when Mars may have been habitable, bodes well for us to learn the story of organic molecules on Mars with future missions that will drill deeper.”

**Seasonal Methane Releases**

In the second paper, scientists describe the discovery of seasonal variations in methane in the Martian atmosphere over the course of nearly three Mars years, which is almost six Earth years. This variation was detected by Curiosity’s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite. 

Water-rock chemistry might have generated the methane, but scientists cannot rule out the possibility of biological origins. Methane previously had been detected in Mars' atmosphere in large, unpredictable plumes. This new result shows that low levels of methane within Gale Crater repeatedly peak in warm, summer months and drop in the winter every year.

""This is the first time we've seen something repeatable in the methane story, so it offers us a handle in understanding it,"" said Chris Webster of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, lead author of the second paper. ""This is all possible because of Curiosity's longevity. The long duration has allowed us to see the patterns in this seasonal 'breathing.'"" 

**Finding Organic Molecules**

To identify organic material in the Martian soil, Curiosity drilled into sedimentary rocks known as mudstone from four areas in Gale Crater. This mudstone gradually formed billions of years ago from silt that accumulated at the bottom of the ancient lake. The rock samples were analyzed by SAM, which uses an oven to heat the samples (in excess of 900 degrees Fahrenheit, or 500 degrees Celsius) to release organic molecules from the powdered rock.

SAM measured small organic molecules that came off the mudstone sample – fragments of larger organic molecules that don’t vaporize easily. Some of these fragments contain sulfur, which could have helped preserve them in the same way sulfur is used to make car tires more durable, according to Eigenbrode.

The results also indicate organic carbon concentrations on the order of 10 parts per million or more. This is close to the amount observed in Martian meteorites and about 100 times greater than prior detections of organic carbon on Mars’ surface. Some of the molecules identified include thiophenes, benzene, toluene, and small carbon chains, such as propane or butene.

In 2013, SAM detected some organic molecules containing chlorine in rocks at the deepest point in the crater. This new discovery builds on the inventory of molecules detected in the ancient lake sediments on Mars and helps explains why they were preserved.

Finding methane in the atmosphere and ancient carbon preserved on the surface gives scientists confidence that NASA's Mars 2020 rover and ESA’s (European Space Agency's) ExoMars rover will find even more organics, both on the surface and in the shallow subsurface. 

These results also inform scientists’ decisions as they work to find answers to questions concerning the possibility of life on Mars. 

“Are there signs of life on Mars?” said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, at NASA Headquarters. “We don’t know, but these results tell us we are on the right track.”",,3274,208.0,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8pd53m/megathread_nasas_curiosity_rover_has_found_new/,True,rseasmith,1747635099.89124,climate science,scientific,,

88s8mb,sustainability,action-oriented,Signs of collapse q1 2018,"Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.
 
I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.
 
I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

You can read more about the NASA 2015 temperature analysis [here](http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-record-shattering-global-warm-temperatures-in-2015) (or [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35354579), [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/science/earth/2015-hottest-year-global-warming.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0), or [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/01/20/its-official-2015-smashed-2014s-global-temperature-record-it-wasnt-even-close/)). You can also check out the [NOAA analysis](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/global/201512) — which also found 2015 was the warmest year on record.

8hfuv0,climatechange,action-oriented,Best book on climate change science,"I'm looking for a book who covers somewhat rigorously the science of climate change, not a pop science book, but that at the same is a introduction to the subject, accessible to a math major who doesn't have a background on science except for high school.  My main goal is to be able to really understand the evidence that supports global warming, and the natural processes underneath it.

Maybe it's important to add that as a math student I'm used to very hard books, and usually science books seems like they were written for children in comparison, so I think I can handle even books that require some background that I don't have.

Searching for such book, I found this one [https://www.amazon.com/Climate\-Change\-Science\-Synthesis\-Physical/dp/940079732X](https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-Science-Synthesis-Physical/dp/940079732X) by G. Thomas Farmer, and I'm wondering if someone here has a opinion about it.

I would appreciate any suggestions that help with my research on the topic.

That said, after reading and interpreting the Vostok ice cores experiment from which a lot of climate change theory is based on, why are we so preoccupied with yearly fluctuations of temperatures? The predictions clearly show that the levels of CO2 operate on a time lag with assumed temperature differences, on an order of thousands of years.

Even quibbling about that, the CO2 cycle for the earth is approximately 100,000 years long. We can quote records as much as we want but scientists that rely on making assessments about global health based on computing yearly data seems incomprehensible to me.

 - The greenhouse effect is a thing which exists, caused by particular atmospheric molecules known as greenhouse gases, which cause temperatures near the Earth's surface to be warmer than they would be without those gases.

 - The greater the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the warmer the Earth's surface will be.

 - CO2 is a greenhouse gas.

 - The quantity of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by nearly 50% over the past couple of hundred years.

 - Due to our understanding of the greenhouse effect that increased CO2 means we expect warming to have occurred. And we observe that warming has occurred.

 - Increased atmospheric CO2 is caused by human activity, primarily burning of fossil fuels.

e2w2m26,climatechange,action-oriented,,"Well, this is an absurdly didactic way of making a point. Here's my attempt to reframe a similar observation in a less-didactic way.

Through most of industrial history, the combustion of fossil fuels has had a very tight relationship with economic growth. You could say that because of the exceptional energy density of fossil fuels, one of the byproducts of burning one unit of fuel (along with emitting one unit of CO2) is a one-unit reduction in global poverty.

One of the tasks included in climate remediation is uncoupling this fairly tight relationship between fossil-fuels/CO2-emissions and economic growth. 

And it's happening now. I'm not aware of any rigorous studies on this question, but if they don't exist now then eventually they will. Currently I believe it's possible to sustain small sections of an average economy on a minimum-CO2-emissions basis. Consider a small upcountry agricultural town in a middle-income country like Malaysia, where there's basically no demand for heavy machines or air travel: You might be able to meet everyone's energy needs with renewable energy and electric vehicles. 

As technology improves, these low-emissions regions of the world economy will get larger. And presumably richer as well, since the demand for economic growth probably won't lessen in our lifetimes. 

But it's going to take several decades to break this link substantially. It's a gigantic task, and technology has many milestones to pass before the energy density of fossil fuels — which is so crucial for heavy machines and industrial applications — can be replicated with low-emissions methods. 

In the meantime, global poverty reduction and economic growth are still going to be largely driven by CO2-emitting processes. It's definitely a cost worth accepting, if you consider poverty reduction and wealth production to be indispensable parts of a morally acceptable future. But the costs of CO2 reduction will have to be paid sometime — most of them probably when technology enables CO2 reduction without undermining efforts at poverty reduction and economic growth. 

It will happen. It's just going to take a long time, and possibly even today's students won't see the arc completed in their lifetimes. This is basically another Industrial Revolution, and it's reasonable to think it will require at least a full human lifetime to complete.",,2,,,,,DocHarford,1747635698.5044422,climate science,scientific,t3_9147zw,9147zw

I co-direct the [King’s Centre for Visualization in Science](http://www.kcvs.ca) and am professor of chemistry at the [King’s University](http://www.kingsu.ca) in Edmonton, Canada. I’m the past-chair of the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry’s (IUPAC) Committee on Chemistry Education and served on the American Chemical Society Presidential Climate Science Working group.

Climate change is a defining challenge of the 21st Century – we’ve got to tackle this with all the scientific tools and imagination we have! Key stakeholders are in our chemistry classrooms right now, so both chemistry education and public awareness have important roles to play. In recent work on the planetary boundary framework that defines a safe operating space for humanity, climate change has been identified (Steffen, Rockström, et al, Science Feb 13, 2015) as one of only two core planetary boundaries with the potential on its own to drive the earth system into a new state, should the boundary be substantially and persistently exceeded. Much of the science underlying earth’s climate relies heavily on measurements and insights from the molecular sciences - so there are compelling reasons for the profession of chemistry to contribute to public understanding of the basic science and the challenges. Sustainable and green chemistry have crucial roles to play in working toward solutions. Did (or do) you experience these connections in the chemistry courses you took?

Check out three resources as you explore how fundamental understanding of chemistry relates to climate change challenges and solutions.
[Explainingclimatechange.com](http://www.explainingclimatechange.com) - An IUPAC legacy project for the International Year of Chemistry to provide a set of critically reviewed, interactive, web-based learning tools to help students, teachers, science professionals and the general public make sense of the underlying science of climate change. 
Visualizing the Chemistry of Climate Change (http://www.vc3chem.com and http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/sc500415k) - A recent project from our group in collaboration with colleagues at Purdue University and the American Chemical Society to create resources for learning general chemistry through the rich context of climate science.  
[ACS Climate Science Toolkit](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience.html) introduces the science of climate change to chemists.
I will be back at 11 am ET. Please AMA about the role for chemistry in addressing climate change challenges and in contributing green & sustainable chemistry solutions. I’m also very interested in discussing how chemistry education can empower the next generation of scientists and citizens to address these issues, and make chemistry more motivating and interesting at the same time.

Hi, I see some really interesting and important questions have been coming in. I’m live now and will start tackling them.

“A group of 75 Australian former and current business figures – including mining engineers and retired geologists – have signed on to an international declaration targeting the UN and the EU and claiming “there is no climate emergency” and that “CO2 is plant food”.

Several of the signatories to the group – which described itself as Clintel – have high-level links to conservative politics, industry and mining”

Well blow me down - they have links to conservative politics, big business and mining. Who’d ever have thought that would be the case.

We are so mightily fucked...and Australia is leading the way.

We haven’t seen the Sun for 4 months and 4 months to go before fresh supplies are flown in. The temperature outside is –67.8°C. AMA!","We are based at the French-Italian research station Concordia on the east high Antarctic plateau (75°S, 123°E, 3233m). It is one of the remotest, coldest, driest places on Earth, we are 1200 km from the coast and our nearest neighbour is 600 km away: the Russian station Vostok. The landscape is an immense white, flat surface of compacted snow extending 1000 km in all directions. The snow and ice on which we walk is more than 3 km thick. Living here is like living on another planet, ‘Planet Concordia’ or ‘White Mars’. During the nine months of winter from February to November, the station is completely isolated from the rest of the world. No plane or vehicle can reach us, even in an emergency as the harsh weather conditions make all travel impossible. We have experienced temperatures down to –80°C and three months of complete darkness. The multicultural crew is consists of 13 people: seven for logistics and six scientists. We are five Italians, one Swiss, one English and six French. This year we are three women and ten men from 24 to 56 years old. We must rely on our own skills and teamwork while being prepared to face any kind of emergency through training, fire, rescue and medical exercises.

Antarctica is the largest, most extreme, multi-disciplinary, open-air scientific laboratory that helps us understand the mechanisms that regulate our planet, its climate, its history and offers a platform to observe and understand the structure of the universe, as well as charting the adaptation of humans to harsh environments. Thanks to the Antarctic Treaty, nations worldwide collaborate peacefully with respect for this environment in the name of science. We are one of very few stations at the heart of the Antarctic continent, so Concordia stands as an important node in the Earth Observatory Grid, for fields such as meteorology, seismology, geomagnetism and atmospheric chemistry.

**Hello there, /r/Science!**

We* are a group of researchers who just [published a paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064888/abstract) showing previous comparisons of global temperatures change from observations and climate models were comparing slightly different things, causing them to appear to disagree far more than they actually do.

The lead author Kevin Cowtan has a backgrounder on the paper [here](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/robust2015/background.html) and data and code posted [here](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/robust2015/methods.html). Coauthor /u/ed_hawkins also did a background post on his blog [here](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2015/an-apples-to-apples-comparison-of-global-temperatures/). 

Basically, the observational temperature record consists of land surface measurements which are taken at 2m off the ground, and sea surface temperature measurements which are taken from, well, the surface waters of the sea. However, most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. The actual sea surface temperature warms at a slightly lower rate than the air above it in climate models, so this apples to oranges comaprison makes it look like the models are running too hot compared to observations than they actually are. This gets further complicated when dealing with the way the temperature at the sea ice-ocean boundaries are treated, as these change over time. All of this is detailed in greater length in Kevin's backgrounder and of course in the paper itself. 

The upshot of our paper is that climate models and observations are in better agreement than some recent comparisons have made it seem, and we are basically warming inline with model expectations when we also consider differences in the modeled and realized forcings and internal climate variability (e.g. [Schmidt et al. 2014](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150000726.pdf)).

3gporh,science,scientific,"PLOS Science Wednesday: We're Jim Hansen, a professor at Columbia’s Earth Institute, and Paul Hearty, a professor at UNC-Wilmington, here to make the case for urgent action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which are on the verge of locking in highly undesirable consequences, Ask Us Anything.","Hi Reddit,

I’m Jim Hansen, a professor at [Columbia University’s Earth Institute]( http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9).<http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9> I'm  joined today by 3 colleagues who are scientists representing different aspects of climate science and coauthors on papers we'll be talking about on this AMA.

--Paul Hearty, paleoecologist and professor at University of North Carolina at Wilmington, NC Dept. of Environmental Studies. “I study the geology of sea-level changes”

--George Tselioudis, of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies; “I head a research team that analyzes observations and model simulations to investigate cloud, radiation, and precipitation changes with climate and the resulting radiative feedbacks.”

--Pushker Kharecha from Columbia University Earth Institute; “I study the global carbon cycle; the exchange of carbon in its various forms among the different components of the climate system --atmosphere, land, and ocean.”

Today we make the case for urgent action to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are on the verge of locking in highly undesirable consequences, leaving young people with a climate system out of humanity's control. Not long after my 1988 testimony to Congress, when I concluded that human-made climate change had begun, practically all nations agreed in a 1992 United Nations Framework Convention to reduce emissions so as to avoid dangerous human-made climate change.  Yet little has been done to achieve that objective.

I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss with researchers and general science readers here on redditscience an alarming situation — as the science reveals climate threats that are increasingly alarming, policymakers propose only ineffectual actions while allowing continued development of fossil fuels that will certainly cause disastrous consequences for today's young people. Young people need to understand this situation and stand up for their rights.

To further a broad exchange of views on the implications of this research, my colleagues and I have published in a variety of open access journals, including, in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648),
[PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648), and most recently, [Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from the Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling that 2 C Global Warming is Highly Dangerous](http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/2015/20150704_IceMelt.pdf), in [Atmos. Chem. & Phys. Discussions](http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/volumes_and_issues.html) (July, 2015).

One conclusion we share in the latter paper is that ice sheet models that guided [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](http://www.ipcc.ch/) sea level projections and upcoming United Nations meetings in Paris are far too sluggish compared with the magnitude and speed of sea level changes in the paleoclimate record. An implication is that continued high emissions likely would result in multi-meter sea level rise this century and lock in continued ice sheet disintegration such that building cities or rebuilding cities on coast lines would become foolish.

The bottom line message we as scientists should deliver to the public and to policymakers is that we have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical. We conclude and reaffirm in our present paper that the crisis calls for an across-the-board rising carbon fee and international technical cooperation in carbon-free technologies. This urgent science must become part of a global conversation about our changing climate and what all citizens can do to make the world livable for future generations.

We’re Camilo Mora and Iain Caldwell, here to talk about our paper in PLOS Biology that investigates how plant growth is impacted by climate change — AUA!","My name is Dr. Camilo Mora and I am an assistant professor at the [University of Hawaii Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). My research focuses on understanding the feedback loops between people and biodiversity. My earlier career was on basic ecology, but then I realized that the effects of people on various species were massive and already evident. Quantifying such impacts and their feedbacks on people represent the main topic of my latest research.


And my name is Dr. Iain Caldwell and I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [University of Hawaii Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). I am an ecologist with broad interests in how organisms can respond to changes in their environment, including the potential consequences of projected climate changes for such organisms.


Along with several colleagues from the University of Hawaii and the [University of Montana](http://www.umt.edu/), we recently published a study in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology) titled [Suitable Days for Plant Growth Disappear under Projected Climate Change: Potential Human and Biotic Vulnerability](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002167). In this paper, we explored the potential consequences of projected climate changes on future plant growth worldwide, and what that could mean for various ecosystems and the people that depend on those ecosystems.


Our findings indicate that, if climate change continues as it has in the past, there could be significant global declines in the number of suitable plant growing days by 2100; with the most drastic changes affecting people in the poorest countries of the world. There is hope though; as our results also indicate that if we can curb our global carbon emissions, these changes in plant-growing conditions should be far less severe.

You can skip to 7:00 to start. The more libertarians learn about climate science, the more they reject it.

I have read articles that claim that if you can have a reasonable conversation with people, that describing the scientific consensus can help convince some people.

70&#37; of Americans can't name a living scientist!!!

Having spoken to people about climate change for 20 years I would estimate that perhaps 3&#37; of the population understands the immediate threat of climate change and things like albedo changes in the Arctic, 7000 methane pingos being formed in Siberia, the corrosion of shells of various plankton in the ocean, the need to draw down at least 10 billion tons a year of CO2 from the atmosphere, that many climate feed backs are not included in climate change projection models etc.

Humans just don't want to hear about climate change. People very close to me shut off science presentations created for The National Academies of Science that we were going to watch because the information scared the crap out of them and they had to tune it out even though they run a solar energy company. Many people simply want to BELIEVE THE LIES put forth and heavily funded by fossil fuel interests. [http://kochcash.org/the-kochtopus/](http://kochcash.org/the-kochtopus/)

A large portion of the population is just not intelligent enough to understand the science through no fault of their own. Humans were hunter gatherers for most of their existence and now have been thrust into a highly sophisticated technological society and they have not had time to adjust to modern complexity and science cognitively and emotionally.

Tribal association that helped humans survive now cause humans to reject the science that is not accepted by their modern day tribes. There is no greater glaring example of scientific illiteracy and the rejection of science than the Republican party members, although in many cases this probably  has to do with pure greed, and the huge payoffs for lying, which is another human flaw.

Most people hold superstitious beliefs while science is based on rational thinking and evidence. There is an inverse relationship between high IQ and scientific expertise and religious belief.

I hope some of this is helpful. Good luck with your efforts.

>**Abstract**

>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.

>**Abstract**

>Establishing the presence and state of organic matter, including its possible biosignatures, in martian materials has been an elusive quest, despite limited reports of the existence of organic matter on Mars. We report the in situ detection of organic matter preserved in lacustrine mudstones at the base of the ~3.5-billion-year-old Murray formation at Pahrump Hills, Gale crater, by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite onboard the Curiosity rover. Diverse pyrolysis products, including thiophenic, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds released at high temperatures (500° to 820°C), were directly detected by evolved gas analysis. Thiophenes were also observed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Their presence suggests that sulfurization aided organic matter preservation. At least 50 nanomoles of organic carbon persists, probably as macromolecules containing 5% carbon as organic sulfur molecules.

I'm an early career ocean-atmosphere scientist (just started a postdoc last September at COLA in ENSO research!) and had a couple of field and career related questions.

Career Q:
Obviously networking and publishing are two of the most important things to an early career scientist. What other things can an ECS do to attract notoriety and improve their chances at landing a job within the field? On that note, was there a sort of a-ha moment that pushed you toward a tenure-track position vs. an industry position?

Science Q: 
I'm currently working with CESM, and was wondering what your opinion is on state of the art coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. What shortcomings do they have? Where should we be focusing our efforts on improving them?

Personal Q:
Did Dr. Busalacchi ever give you any good stories about his PhD advisor, JJO? Jim's a real hoot.

During EN Modoki conditions, the warm surface water is in the central Pacific rather than the eastern Pacific like EN's, & during LN Modoki conditions, it's in both the eastern & western Pacific rather than just the west like typical LN's.

They say this is important because the worst tropical cyclones in the northwestern Pacific (""typhoons"") occur during El Niño Modoki conditions, with ""regular"" El Niño conditions second.

I was just in Hong Kong less than a week ago, sure it is cold there! Anyways, speaking of disease control, we (I come from Singapore) have experienced disease outbreaks of large scale due to our shared hot and sometimes wet climate, like the SARS outbreak back in 2003.

Is there a possibility that culture plays a key role in disease transmission? Even in the modern world, we do keep traditions like sanitizing plates in Hong Kong at the table using hot water, when we drink we sometimes share a cup, etc, and hence are causing an unpredictable spread of diseases, which makes modeling even tougher?

Also, Hong Kong and Singapore do share a high population density, living in apartment buildings. Do you see trends of infection where one building gets mostly infected, then it starts spreading to other buildings, and modeling across the different stories that people live on?

One last question, infectious disease control is of utmost importance and urgency to nations. Seeing different countries' response to the Ebola outbreak, what can we learn in terms of hospital segmentation and pre-screening at borders? How does your model cope with these capture zones?

I'm an Environmental Science  student and incredibly concerned about the future. 

My question is: realistically, do you think it will be possible to meet our goals to decarbonise the global economy without addressing areas such as shipping and aviation (absent from Paris Agreement), livestock agriculture and continued economic growth? For example there's current talks of expanding Heathrow which clearly goes against our climate agreements. We currently have no means to decarbonise these industries on a large scale and yet the demand grows every year. Even if we can decarbonise energy, heat and motor transport how do we tackle the more 'wicked problems' of the global economy before the carbon budget is effectively used up?

Also if I'm allowed a second question, I recently listened to a talk by Kevin Anderson on academia and climate change. Do you think in some way academia perpetuates the high-carbon lifestyle? For example, flying internationally for meetings/conferences.

AMA!","Right now, I am at 34°26.7 south latitude and 171°20.8 east longitude, or about 400 km northwest of Auckland. Along with a large crew and international science team, I am on board the research ship JOIDES Resolution partaking in Expedition 371, a two month long mission to drill submerged portions of northern Zealandia. Per background, Zealandia is a large (~5 million km2), mostly underwater fragment of continental crust, and thus increasingly referred to as Earth’s hidden continent. From a science perspective, Zealandia provides an end-member piece of Earth’s surface in which to understand plate tectonics, particularly the initiation of subduction, the process where one plate moves beneath another. Unlike exposed regions of more familiar continents, where erosion often dominates, much of Zealandia has been accumulating sediment records at relatively shallow water depth for the last 50 or so million years. Expedition 371 is a major push by the broad science community to understand the geological history and past climate of the region. I am always happy sharing my fascination with oceanography and the evolution of our Earth. You can check out some recent articles on Zealandia as well as photographs and videos of Expedition [here](https://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/tasman_frontier_subduction_climate.html)

6s56co,science,scientific,"Science AMA: I’m Seema Jayachandran, economist at Northwestern University. Let me tell you why paying poor farmers to not cut down forests is a cheap way to combat climate change. AMA about why small amounts of money for Ugandan farmers helped preserve endangered chimp habitat, and the atmosphere.","Hi Reddit!

My name is Seema Jayachandran, and I’m an economics professor at Northwestern University, specializing in low-income countries.

I am affiliated with the Poverty Action Lab at MIT (J-PAL), which has championed the use of randomized controlled trials to study the effectiveness of social/economic policies. I am also affiliated with Innovations for Poverty Action, who was our partner for data collection in Uganda for the research I am here to talk about.

My collaborators and I just [published a paper in Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6348/267),
 [short summary here](http://www.poverty-action.org/study/testing-effectiveness-payments-ecosystem-services-enhance-conservation-uganda), that evaluates a program in Uganda that paid individuals to keep their forest intact. Most of the forest is owned by poor farmers who have been cutting trees to sell to timber or charcoal dealers as an extra source of income, or to use the cleared land for growing crops. As a result, the forest is disappearing at one of the fastest rates seen anywhere in the world. The Ugandan government wanted to protect the forest to save chimpanzees and other endangered species, whose habitat is dwindling.

Preserving forests has another big benefit for all of us: It keeps CO2 out of the atmosphere. Trees naturally absorb and sequester CO2 from the atmosphere as part of photosynthesis.  The carbon they are storing is emitted into the atmosphere when they are burned or decompose. Paying forest owners to keep their forests intact is thus one way we can reduce global CO2 emissions.  Furthermore, offering a payment and making the program voluntary means that, unlike under a ban, we are not making poor people worse off. This approach (called “Payments for Ecosystem Services” or PES) has been used in Costa Rica and elsewhere, but there has been a lot of skepticism about whether it actually works (for reasons I’m happy to discuss).

We decided to rigorously test how well PES works using a randomized trial; some villages got the program, and some didn’t. A Ugandan conservation non-profit called [CSWCT](http://www.ngambaisland.org/pes-project) ran the program, and we evaluated the program’s impacts. We compared the amount of deforestation in villages with the program (treatment group) to the ones without it (control group) using satellite imagery.  This is the first time PES has been tested with the randomized controlled trial method.

Bottom-line finding: The program saved a lot of forest. We converted that gain in forest into a quantitative dollar benefit to the world from the delayed CO2 emissions (I’m happy to explain more about how we did that). The climate-change benefits were more than twice the program costs. Our findings don’t mean PES will work always and everywhere, but they should make us more bullish on it. IMO, rich countries should be upping their funding for programs that pay people in poor countries to preserve forests. We need to reduce CO2 emissions, and this seems like a bargain way to do it.

The study was widely covered, [including by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/climate/a-cheap-fix-for-climate-change-pay-people-not-to-chop-down-trees-uganda.html), [the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/07/paying-people-to-preserve-their-trees/534351/), [InsideClimateNews](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20072017/stopping-deforestation-payment-ecosystem-services-trees-uganda-climate-change), and [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/uganda-deforestation-pay).  Northwestern was kind (or mean) enough to post a [short video interview](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/july/cash-for-carbon-a-cost-effective-way-to-reduce-deforestation/) with me as well.

TL;DR In a first-of-its-kind controlled experiment, paying poor Ugandans not to cut down their forests created twice the value in avoided climate costs as was spent on the program.  We should do it more.

I’ll be back at ~12:00 ET to answer questions!

6uviip,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: We’re a group of researchers in Tuktoyaktuk using drones, thermal imaging, laser scanning and more to better understand the climate-change driven acceleration of Arctic coastal erosion in the Western Canadian Arctic. Ask us anything!","Hi Reddit! Permafrost coasts are incredibly dynamic, and highly vulnerable to climate change. Across the ice rich coasts of the western Canadian Arctic, erosion rates have increased by 20 to 200% since the year 2000, with some coasts now retreating at over 50m per year. The erosional mechanisms here are complex and diverse, with a range of often spectacular failure types, from [huge collapsing blocks]( https://i.imgur.com/WUpQ8pv.jpg) to [massive thaw slumps.](https://i.imgur.com/JPPY97O.jpg) As well as causing rapid changes on land, the increased erosion rate over recent decades is substantially increasing the volume of sediment, nutrients and organic carbon exported to the marine eco-system on an annual basis, with knock on impacts on fisheries, carbon balance and more. To better understand the processes governing the increased erosion and to more accurately assess coastal retreat rates, we’re currently using a range of new and novel technologies, from drones and laser scanning, to long-tern time-lapse photography and thermal imaging [even along large stretches using helicopters!]( https://i.imgur.com/UehI4G9.jpg).

We have a great group here, listed below, ready to answer your questions, and a few others that will chime in too!


**Dustin Whalen**: I’m a coastal scientist with Natural Resources Canada. I’ve been studying coastal and nearshore process in the Beaufort sea for the last decade. In that time, I’ve conducted over 30 field programs in the region over the spring, summer and winter, with particular focus on coastal erosion, nearshore sediment dynamics and sea ice break-up.

**Mike Lim**: I’m a senior lecturer in civil engineering from Northumbria University with research interests in coastal geomorphology and slope processes. I’ve previously been engaged in monitoring of coastal dynamics in Svalbard using 3D change detection and thermal characterisation of cliffs.


**Samuel Hayes**: I’m PhD student from Northumbria University studying Arctic coastal erosion. This is my first trip to the Arctic, where my activities have ranged from spending hours digging holes for passive seismic surveys to collecting thermal imagery of permafrost cliffs from helicopter!


**Roger Macleod**: I’m a remote sensing and geomatics specialist with Geological Survey of Canada. I apply new geomatics technologies, from satellite imagery to drones, to improving our understanding of coastal dynamics in the western Canadian Arctic.


**Andrew Gordon**: I’m a technician from the Aurora Research Institute, I have lived here my whole life. I’m an Inuvialuit and a whale hunter.

**Scott Dallimore**: I'm a permafrost scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada. On this project, I'm looking at near shore permafrost degradation.


A special thanks must go to [NERC](http://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx) and [INTERACT](http://www.eu-interact.org/) for providing much of the funding for this research.

MLK: led marches and sit-ins that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT THEY COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. So these actions just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not just the noisemaking. 

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the marches.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country

""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 

But today the public doesn't know what to do when faced with this challenge. They think that yelling in crowds makes a difference when all it does is get them put in some database. 

There are better alternatives. Take this guy who instead of holding a sign that was ignored, [buried a bad cop in paperwork](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/hostile-policing/Content?oid=17445843) and the evidence of this bad cop's activities [got him fired](http://www.king5.com/story/local/2014/09/02/13384714/).

db88829,science,scientific,,"Hey thanks for doing this AMA! This strikes really close to home for me, I live in north west Labrador above the 53rd parallel, very remote area, literally 700 miles in either direction to the next town.

We have a couple of unique features in my area and I'm hoping you can offer some advice.

We have a huge problem with dust. We're located in between two iron ore mines, two very large  ore productions within 2 miles of town.
Their tailings line's have piled up over the last 50 years so basically the entire outline of town is a giant sand pit 

Included a photo for reference. [You can clearly see tailings lines and their proximity to town.](http://imgur.com/FbWRwr4)

One of the mines closed a couple years ago leaving absoutely no upkeep for dust reduction.

And here comes problem number two, 
[the Forrest fire of 2013](http://imgur.com/kvyRyQb)

It's a bit hard to see but on that map but you can see the outline of the tailings sand pits from the previous photo and, in red,the amount of tree cover we lost to that one fire.

So, after spending the last 3 years choked to death with [dust](http://imgur.com/PcoQixp) in the summer time.

And being ""Conveniently"" located in between the two biggest CO2 producers east of Montreal, and with the upcoming changes in the carbon tax pricing

I've been looking at the viability of a Silviculture project to help with 
 
1) dust suppression
2) reforestation 
3) species diversification 
4) local area ascetics 
5) the creation of offset credits

So my questions are

What cold hardy species can be successfully introduced to a boreal forest area, dominated by coniferous trees to improve diversification? 

in regards to dust suppression, I'm assuming a root heavy shrub or bush, perhaps an alder bed might be more effective in retaining top soil material.
In the past they would just hydroseed grass on top, but that requires annual upkeep. Any species in mind that might have a good, fast growing(hopefully not super invasive), tight holding root system to use in between tress?

And honestly, I don't know very much about the creation of offset credits, any experience with this? 

And in regard to asethic, you can see the entire project area from my town, do you know of any diversification projects that had visual appeal for an area in mind during the creation process?  I'd love to look into them

Thanks agian for doing this AMA, look forward to your reply

I have a few questions:

- If tomorrow (well, in a few decades), SpaceX or others offer you to be part of the first manned mission to Mars, will you go ?

- Is there a current estimate of the prevalence of water ice (or water in any form) on exoplanets ?

- Based on your knowledge, what probability would you give to the discovery of life (past or present) on Mars in more complex forms than microbial life ?

- Would there be reservations (other than cost) to perform an EPICA-like coring operation on Mars ? Based on current knowledge of ice depths on Mars, how far could we ""go back in time"" with such coring ?

His career has taken him from Greenland to the Antarctic. He has dedicated his life to this field of study. So, when you (my uncle) tell me that climate change is bogus, you're telling me that my close friend is either lying to me or incompetent.

What I always wondered about whether you can run climate models backwards in time? If it is feasible you can you 'hindcast' (as opposed to forecast) events like the ice age? Generally if you run climate models backwards do the models 'predict' what we know about past climate?

I am a grad student in a biology lab, but I would be very gad to know more about this topic, so please feel free to refer to academic papers that I can follow up:)

The thing is, if I were going to rack and stack possible reasons I'm not sure temperature swings would even crack the top five. I have seen everything in the hobby from people who perpetually keep their tank water far too hot, to accidental rapid temperature spikes and generally those don't end in a bleaching scenario. Too much / too bright of lights, incorrect chemical and trace element mixtures, impurities, and parasites almost always end up being the culprit. 

So this being the case, what data do you have to show that warming is a more likely cause than say man dumping pesticides into the ocean?  I completely agree what is happening must be man made, and I know global warming is real, but I honestly don't see how it is warming causing the bleaching. Surely it is more likely all the crap we dump in the oceans.

It's geoengineering at a scale that is beyond anything we could imagine. And that's their *conservative* projection.

1. Confirmation bias as in "" I have never experienced mass extinction thus mass extinction can't happen in my lifetime"".

2. Fear of death. Climate change carries with it the possibility of lethal catastrophe. Pondering this throws a wrench in any healthy mind, which leads to grief and all its stages. Psychologically the path of least resistance is to ignore the threat. Many scientist have unconsciously chosen this path. I don't blame them. I envy them.

3. Peer pressure. It is very bad form for a scientist to predict the end of the world. Science history is littered with brilliant scientists that threw away their credibility and scientific careers by wrongly proclaiming the end of the world. So to avoid negative peer pressure, their work dance around evidence giving hints of catastrophe but never achieving definitive conclusions. 

4. Credibility. The climate is the mother of all human relevant random systems so it carries much uncertainty. Within that uncertainty the data is clearly pointing to substantial change, but how it will play out or whether it plays out at all is in the realm of speculation.  So they make predictions like 1 meter sea level rise in a hundred years or 4 degrees C in a hundred years. The more time they give their prediction the higher the chances they will be right. However climate change plays out, in a hundred years it will be warmer, but they don't know how it will play out.

Our understandings of climate change science are the same the world over. Fossil fuel funded climate change denial entities have done a great job in fooling many people in believing otherwise. That being said the IPCC has been too conservative in their estimates of the rate of change.

The IPCC reports have underestimated the decline of Arctic Sea ice as well as sea level rise because temperature feed backs that were not previously well understood were not included in the models. Scientists cannot predict how significant future methane releases will be as well as other feed backs.

As already mentioned IPCC reports that show a meaningful reduction in future temperature scenarios assume that a carbon capture miracle will be found.

For people that have not watched it yet Kevin Anderson's presentation on our carbon budget IMHO this is still one of the best assessments that I have seen yet and that is why I keep posting it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF1zNpzf8RM

He believes scientists are somewhat under pressure not to tell people how bad things are.

Although the Arctic sea ice was only the second lowest extent on record a lot of the ice that was measured was not strong, solid ice.
As we lose the reflective snow and ice cap that reflects the Sun's energy back into space more heat is being absorbed by the darker surfaces. If this continues it will not be long before more feed backs kick in accelerating the warming even faster.

Ocean heating is killing reefs around the world and ocean acidification is already wreaking havoc on the small shell forming organisms that are the base food of many oceanic food chains.

There should be a WW2 level attempt by all governments to develop carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will reduce the level of catastrophes that we will experience in the future as the changes that we have already caused reach equilibrium.

For those people that haven't yet learned how the Arctic Amplification is affecting global temperatures the following is a fairly comprehensive overview.

11 944 papers analyzed. Of all the abstracts, 32.6% endorse Antropomorphic Global Warming (3896). On the other side, 66.4% of the papers (7930) have NO position whatsoever. 0.7% reject it, and 0.3% are uncertain. People are mislead as to what the actual numbers are behind this study, it is not a meere 3% who reject or are uncertain, it is more like 66.4% who do not even have a position on the subject, maybe because they don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly? I really don't know, i'm asking.

Out of the 32.6% who endorse it, 97.1% actually have a POSITION on the subject. So, if i take into account the 11 944 papers analyzed, it is still 32.6% of all the papers reviewed, not 97.1%. Quote from the study:

> The ISI search generated 12 465 papers. Eliminating papers that were not peer-reviewed (186), not climate-related (288) or without an abstract (47) reduced the analysis to 11 944 

So, my question is, who is the 66.4% that has no position? But they are climate related? They are peer reviewed and have an abstract. It wasn't even taken into account. The soul purpuse of this study is to see if there is a consensus on the matter, and the only thing i see it 32.6? out of 11 944 papers endorse and have a position on antropomorphic climate change. Not 97.1%. 

I think this is more of a public relations scheme more than anything, in the conclusion of the study it says quite clearly:

> The public perception of a scientific consensus on AGW is a necessary element in public support for climate policy (Ding et al 2011)

> The narrative presented by some dissenters is that the scientific consensus is '...on the point of collapse' (Oddie 2012) while '...the number of scientific ""heretics"" is growing with each passing year' (Allègre et al 2012).

Am I an Heretic to question this study?

There will be nothing to hunt and gather from. The Chicxulub asteroid took out the dinosaurs and seventy percent of all recorded species, while the Permian Greenhouse Extinction exterminated well over ninety percent. After each of those events, it took millions of years for biodiversity to recover to its former level - inside of totally novel ecosystems, of course. As E. O. Wilson pointedly titles the second chapter of his last book 'Humanity Needs a Biosphere'.

d3net2r,collapse,skeptical,,"RE: lifeboats

I've been reading up on arcology recently and doing some brainstorming, and it looks almost impossible to actually construct one that can survive on its own in the long-term in most regions.

1. Biospheres 1 and 2, BIOS-3, and MARS-500 were all plagued with multiple and very different problems ranging from unforeseen variables in maintaining a closed habitat to psychological stress making participants *absolutely fucking crazy*. Any arcology is going to run into the same problems, and overcoming them is a huge engineering challenge.

2. Arcology projects do not have a good track record. The Dongtan arcology collapsed before the 2010 World Expo. Crystal Island lost funding after the 2008 financial crisis. Seward's Success was never constructed. The only ""successful"" arcologies that exist are perhaps the Las Vegas Strip and McMurdo Station in Antarctica, and neither of them are actually sustainable and making them sustainable seems impossible.

3. I don't think it is controversial to say that vertical farming is basically the only way an arcology can feed itself, which itself has many unresolved issues in terms of sustainability. On top of that, hydro/aeroponics systems are only good for producing herbs, drugs, and salad greens. Aquaponics shows promise, but the sustainability challenges for those are even larger.

4. Sustainable energy, itself, is vulnerable to climate change. Venezuela found out the hard way that producing most of your power from hydroelectric dams leaves you vulnerable to sustained drought. Solar is only useful in equatorial regions, which are also the regions with the greatest challenges due to global warming. Wind power is intermittent and would make the arcology's footprint enormous. Fossil fuels are right out. Only nuclear and geothermal seem to be useful in terms of arcologies, which means we either build around volcanos or we start dumping spent fuel rods into the ocean. Not great.

5. Water presents a problematic constraint. If we build near fresh water sources, flooding becomes a risk. If we build near oceans and rely on desalination, sea level rise and superstorms become a risk. If we rely on aquifers, geothermal becomes difficult and we risk relying on a depleting resource. If we rely on rain, drought becomes a risk. Only a self-contained water management system could work, which itself presents enormous engineering challenges on the scale required for an arcology.

7. You might be familiar with the Mouse Utopia Experiment. Mice were given all the food, water, nesting they needed to live comfortably. They all went crazy and killed each other long before the resources were even strained, and while we don't know *why* the best guess is oversocialization. We do not know how vulnerable human populations would be to the same problems or how to resolve those problems, and as with the Mouse Utopia it could spell disaster in a very short amount of time.

8. The division of labor presents another constraint. I've seen estimates that you need an urban population of over 100k to sustain intellectual labor, as otherwise there is too much physical labor to do for people to spend time learning complex mathematics or physics. This either means the arcology has to be *fucking huge* or we need to offload a lot more labor onto automation than we currently can. Otherwise, our capacity to tackle challenges as they arise will become crippled by our lack of innovation.

9. An arcology also has to either have a more efficient recycling system than has ever been constructed or it needs a way to acquire new resources for replacing worn out or broken parts. Unless this arcology is extremely low-tech, it needs to have a source of valuable minerals and chemicals to keep itself running. This presents constraints on where you can build, and will necessarily increase the footprint of the structure.

10. Last, but most importantly, if we build a self-sustaining arcology it will be the first one to ever exist. We won't have time to build more experimental projects to test for unforeseen problems, so we'll be discovering new challenges along the way. An unaccounted variable could mean disaster for the entire population, so we'll need to build lots of different ones and hope that one survives.

All together, we are talking about *multiple* multi-trillion dollar projects that only a few hundred thousand could possibly benefit from.

The problem you seem to be having is understanding what ""extinction"" actually means. You don't get to ""extinction"" by lumping together a bunch of random bad things we're unsure about, and then kind of wave your hands and say, ""... and then everyone dies!"" That's not an argument. To make extinction believable, **you have to show evidence** that the specific things you're talking about can make the **entire planet** uninhabitable for homo sapiens.

I'll give you an easy example. Let's say (for the sake of argument) that something about global warming this time is somehow very different from every other time it's happened in the last 2 billion years, and it basically turns the Earth into another Venus. **That** would be an example of extinction, because obviously we (nor anything else) can survive temperatures that can melt lead or the pressure of 90 atmospheres. 

You haven't done anything like that. You point to a list of smaller events (comparatively), wave your hands and say ""we don't know"", and then conclude: extinction.

Sorry. That's fantasy thinking.

Sometimes it doesn't even seem like you even understand what you're talking about. ""Our hardy band of hunter-gatherers is going to be up against an increase in agricultural pests."" Do you know what hunter-gatherers are? You do realize that we've been here for 200,000 years, right? And that most of that time had nothing to do with agriculture?

You also have to address the arguments of your opponents. Just waving your hands and calling every argument against extinction ""hubris"" does not count as evidence, nor does it count as an argument. It's basically an emotional, faith-based, fact-free response.

I'll close by pointing out an uncomfortable truth about collapse and people who talk about it. On a basic level, there are those among us (those concerned about collapse) who aren't here for rational reasons. There are people drawn to collapse for the same reason people are drawn to apocalyptic religions -- there is some weird part of them that wants to see the human race destroy itself.

And that's basically what we have here: you start with the conclusion that the human race will go extinct, and then work backwards, listing a bunch of random things (that are indeed bad) hoping it will magically ""add up"" to the outcome you've placed your faith in... but it doesn't.

I am okay with 'making stuff' and considered making my own DSSC cells for my roof. I know they are less efficient, but I planned on making a model and seeing how long they might last under extreme UV to try and simulate accelerated aging.

I don't need my beautiful and wonderful wife's face all screwed up at me for no reason-- takes away from the pleasing aesthetic and derails what could have been more enjoyable dinner conversation...)

I am not opposed to having specialized tools or chemicals/process in my shed away from my house.

The two requirements are that they cost less than commercially produced cells (which seem to be unusually expensive for the materials that go into them). And that they will last 10-15 years.

From there, I should be able to come up with a water tight design, set of steps to create a standard form factor, and the circuitry to patch into a commercial load handler (yeah, I'm not building that myself I can get 5V@???A output from the cells to whatever the input is (a Magnum Energy Inverter per se... they have 12/24V@~100A units like this one http://www.solarelectricsupply.com/solar-components/solar-inverter/magnum/the-ms-series-pure-sine-wave-inverter-charger-ms4024 ).

We pretty much monitored the ammeters all the time and two strange phenomena which we observed , and I have no clear idea why they occured.

1) When there was a very thin (alto-cirrus?) wispy cloud layer in the sky, the charging current increased to about 2.8A from a baseline of 2A - approaching the rated output of the panel.

2) When we poured cold water on the panels, the charging current would rise to about 2.6A from a baseline of 2A. The water came from a very cold mountain river, so it would have been at most 15 degrees centigrade. The boost lasted for a few minutes.

30lpjq,collapse,skeptical,"An increasingly dysfunctional, dangerous, and Dark Future","Someone recently asked me:

*Did/do you think that the situation can/could be reversed and that we (humans) would/will do what was needed to be done years ago and didn’t?”*

I feel I’ve listened to enough experts, read enough scientific reports, lurked around enough internet forums, and observed my fellow man enough to say that there is no point in trying to keep up with the latest newsbite for any sign of real change in the status quo. I see that the IPCC is consistently overly conservative and in fact incorporates into its global warming projections the [assumption that we will invent technologies to pull CO2 from the atmosphere](http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2772427/survivable_ipcc_projections_are_based_on_science_fiction_the_reality_is_much_worse.html) in order to avoid the worst-case scenarios. The IPCC also [does not event count](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12525) the CO2 emissions from the single largest polluter on the planet -the U.S. Military. No government has a coherent plan and in fact repeatedly works to undermine any such plan that is intended to deal with the collapsing biosphere. For instance, CO2 emissions from First World countries were simply [off-shored to developing countries](https://www.youtube.com/embed/E2QkkgNDV3Y). Pete Dolack of [Systemic Disorder](http://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/) blog told me these new trade agreements like the TPP would “speed up global warming and other environmental destruction.” Anything that interferes with more and more growth is eliminated or disregarded because economic growth is what generates profit and tax revenue to keep the whole Ponzi scheme going. From one of Pete Dolack’s recent essays:

>…The earliest countries that adopted capitalism could “export” their “excess” population though mass emigration. From 1820 to 1915, Professors Foster and McChesney write, more than 50 million people left Europe for the “new world.” But there are no longer such places for developing countries to send the people for whom capitalism at home can not supply employment. Not even a seven percent growth rate for 50 years across the entire global South could absorb more than a third of the peasantry leaving the countryside for cities, they write. Such a sustained growth rate is extremely unlikely.

>As with the growing environmental crisis, these mounting economic problems are functions of the need for ceaseless growth. Once again, infinite growth is not possible on a finite planet, especially one that is approaching its limits. Worse, to keep the system functioning at all, the [planned obsolescence of consumer products](https://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/the-high-cost-of-new-and-improved/) necessary to continually stimulate household spending accelerates the exploitation of natural resources at unsustainable rates and all this unnecessary consumption produces pollution increasingly stressing the environment.

>Humanity is currently consuming the [equivalent of one and a half earths](http://footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/world_footprint/), according to the non-profit group Global Footprint Network. A separate report by WWF–World Wide Fund For Nature in collaboration with the Zoological Society of London and Global Footprint Network, calculates that the Middle East/Central Asia, Asia-Pacific, North America and European Union regions are each [consuming about double](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/images/uploads/LPR_2012.pdf) their regional biocapacity… – [Link](https://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/2015/03/18/unemployment-double-official-rate/)

Nearly all the population is ecologically illiterate, and this includes well-educated doctors, technical and engineering experts, public officials, teachers, etc. The environment is invisible to most of these people because they are blinded by bias and ignorance, inundated by mass media feel-good consumerist propaganda, or simply too tired from the drudgery of their work to give a fuck. I can no longer pretend that the human species has anything but an increasingly dysfunctional, dangerous, and dark future. Look at how the Middle East is unraveling right now. That area can’t be cleaned up or made even halfway normal again because they are suffering systemic collapse from climate change, overpopulation, resource wars, and overreach of American empire.

No, the situation cannot be reversed any time soon because the global economy is already committed to many more decades of fossil fuel burnings as so many have already pointed out. For Example:

>“Greenhouse gas emissions are expected to continue to rise—nobody thinks we have reached maximum emissions and things will soon be turning around,” Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif., said…

>…“Substantial reductions in emissions are possible for both the U.S. and the rest of the world, but it will take herculean efforts and transforming the global energy system into one that does not use the sky as a waste dump,” Caldeira said. “Tiny, but positive policy moves, like increasing automobile efficiency, certainly help, but if we are to get serious about avoiding the risk of dangerous climate change, we need to up our game by somewhere between a factor of 10 and 100 over what we are doing now.” – [Link](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-flat-co2-pollution-mean/)

and…

>…Since 2000, global carbon intensity has dropped by about 1% per year. But if we want to avoid more than 2°C of global warming, global carbon intensity has to drop by about 6% per year… – [Link](http://www.vox.com/2015/3/16/8224915/economic-growth-carbon-emissions)

Of course the oft-repeated 2°C global warming limit is, as we know, an arbitrary number concocted by politicians and business leaders for their convenience and not based on any sort of evidence that such a limit would actually protect us from ruin. Indeed, the 0.85°C that we have already experienced has set into motion catastrophic ice sheet melt at the poles and disrupted the earth’s hydrologic cycle, Jet Streams, and weather patterns. Sea level rise is accelerating exponentially and could reach 7 meters by 2070, according to the [calculations of physicist and climatologist Paul Beckwith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N330egsJD8A). Florida, one of the most vulnerable states to SLR, forbids its government officials to even utter the words climate change or sea level rise and then forces them to undergo a psychiatric evaluation if they do. These sort of antics that we keep reading about in the news certainly don’t inspire confidence that this species has a long and prosperous future before it. Hell, even supposedly “biodegradable plastic” really is [not biodegradable](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/msu-atb032015.php). Humans have created a bubble civilization which has completely detached its inhabitants from reality and the fact that their economy is entirely a subsidiary of the natural world, not vise versa. Rather than accepting this, what are we doing? Building sea walls and desalination plants, establishing new shipping routes and exploiting resources in the thawing Arctic, and studying ways to geoengineer the weather. This is how this civilization defines progress and anyone who gets in the way is a terrorist of some sort. Many things could have been done decades ago and they never were. Each day that goes by is simply another nail in our already sealed coffin.

We haven’t changed for decades except to increase global consumption of all resources and expel [ever-larger amounts of waste](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/10/30/global-waste-on-pace-to-triple) -GHGs, trash, plastic, and chemical pollution. Africa and South America are working on destroying the last two large rainforests in the world. Capitalism has spread like a cancer across the globe and the peasants are moving to the megacities in developing countries. Growth, growth, growth. All while the natural world continues to dwindle with [mass die-offs happening at an ever-increasing rate over the last century](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150113-mass-die-off-disease-animals-environment-science/). If we are changing, I think it’s more like a tumor metastasizing and engulfing its host.

We've blown past both measures.,"As the debate on climate change continues to be framed around what we need to do to keep the temperature increase below 2 degrees, I thought I'd put out a reminder of what [the agreed science, on the basis of 2,500 scientists](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains5-4.html), said ten years ago about where we needed to be now to have a chance of avoiding 2 degrees. Rather than peaking 2 years ago, [emissions reached an all-time high this year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/11/13/fossil-fuel-emissions-projected-to-reach-an-all-time-high-in-2017-dashing-hopes-of-progress/), and CO2 is hovering around 407 parts per million, having broken through [410 ppm at its peak back in April](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-just-breached-the-410-ppm-threshold-for-co2/).

The 2007 report was also the last one before the UN IPCC started basing future scenarios on fantasy technologies, primarily negative emissions technologies such as CO2 removal. A recent article [explained that the optimistic scenarios the UN now references all incorporate these technologies, within years, at scale](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-secret-of-the-worlds-plan-to-avert-climate-disaster/). But it’s not happening. 

It’s also worth remembering that in 2015, the year we were supposed to stabilise for 2 degrees but blew straight past, the politicians in Paris decided on a 1.5 degree goal that, on the basis of the science standing behind that goal, seems literally impossible. Which indicates that Paris was a success for collective cognitive dissonance if nothing else.",,88,32.0,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/7kcznk/ten_years_ago_the_uns_climate_change_panel_said/,True,veraknow,1747678535.577028,IPCC report,scientific,,

What changes happen to hurricanes when ocean temperatures rise? And what is the likelihood of extreme winds and deep storm surges at locations along a hurricane-prone coastline? Typically, I use statistics and maps to help answer my questions. And, as a geographer, I always make sure that the spatial element of the problem is included because, for me, differences across space are everything!

I'll be back at 12 pm ET to answer your questions, ask me anything!

Ask Us Anything!","PROFESSOR: [Kristine DeLong, paleoclimatologist at Louisiana State University](http://ga.lsu.edu/faculty/kristine-delong/)

DOCUMENTARY JOURNALIST: [Ben Raines, AL.com environmental reporter](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/alcom_writer_ben_raines_to_rec.html)

The Underwater Forest details the discovery and exploration of an ancient cypress forest found sixty feet underwater in the Gulf of Mexico, due south of Gulf Shores, Alabama. The forest dates to an ice age more than 60,000 years ago, when sea levels were about 400 feet lower than they are today. The forest appears to be a wholly unique relic of our planet’s past, the only known site where a coastal ice age forest this old has been preserved in place. It is considered a treasure trove of information, providing new insights into everything from climate in the region to annual rainfall, insect populations, and the types of plants that inhabited the Gulf Coast before humans arrived in the new world. Scientific analysis of the site is ongoing.


The documentary follows the work of the team investigating the site, both underwater and in the laboratory. The film was written and directed by AL.com’s Ben Raines, who also filmed the underwater sequences and organized the first scientific missions to the site.


The scientists believe the forest was buried beneath the Gulf sediments for eons, until giant waves driven by Hurricane Ivan in 2004 uncovered it. Raines and AL.com collected the first samples from the site, and participated in every scientific mission to the site, beginning in 2012. Dropping 10 fathoms down, below the green waves of the Gulf and back in time to this prehistoric world amounts to a sort of time traveler’s journey. Nothing like the forest, in terms of age or scale, has ever been found. The oxygen-free underwater environment has hermetically sealed the trees in a sort of natural time capsule.

**About Kristine:**
I study past climate and am interested in the changes that occurred in the last 2,000 years as well as the past 125,000 years during the last ice age. I am a scuba diver and my research is mostly in the tropics and subtropics (I prefer warm water diving).

I just spent an amazing three days introducing Louisiana wetlands to 10 incredible minority undergraduates, many of whom have never seen an ocean or a wetland. We saw how Tropical Storm Cindy changed a barrier island, dodge thunderstorms in boat, kayaked in the salt grass marsh lands, had a shrimp boil with my colleagues from the United Houma native american tribe (Merci beaucoup Seafood Kingdom!), and toured the Atchafalaya baldcypress swamp with The Nature Conservancy - Louisiana. 

I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering and worked in the corporate world for 12 years before going back to school to get my Ph.D. 

The Underwater Forest is a project I have been involved in for five years now and it has truly been a unique experience in many ways. I found Ben online and we started to talk about the forest and he took me out to see it. I contacted colleagues to tell them about the trees and we dated the first wood samples; we were very surprise to learn how old they were. This is truly a unique site due to its location and age. I now lead a team of six scientists, four graduate students, one undergraduate, and other colleagues in researching the underwater ancient forest. I am seeking new collaborations and I want to bring in other experts to the project so we can learn as much as we can from this unique time capsule of an ice age landscape. Our team has learned a lot about the site but we still have many more questions to answer.

**About Ben:**
I first learned of the Underwater Forest from a dive shop owner in Alabama. He discovered the forest about a year after Hurricane Ivan, when a fisherman came into the dive shop and said, “I’ve found this spot that’s just loaded with fish but there’s barely anything in terms of structure that shows up on my depth finder. Why don’t you go out there and take a look.” The fisherman turned over the coordinates to his spot, and the dive shop owner made a trip and found the bottom littered with cypress stumps and logs scattered around. 

Luckily, the dive shop guy decided to keep the location a secret. He did so because of his experience seeing small natural coral outcroppings destroyed by divers collecting live rock for the aquarium trade. Knowing I was an environmental journalist, he decided to tell me about the forest. After a couple years of bugging him, he agreed to take me to the site on the condition that I never reveal the coordinates to anyone. He agreed to let me write a story. Kristine called me the day the story came out, explained her expertise as a scuba diving paleoclimatologist, and asked if I could get her samples of the wood so she could have them carbon dated. 

When those first samples turned out to be radio-carbon dead, meaning too old to be dated that way, she asked if she could come with us to the site and collect more samples. You see her first visit to the forest in the film. She assembled a team of scientists including dendrochronologists, geologists and paleontologists. Much of their research is revealed in the film and in several papers Kristine has published. Some of the most interesting finds are newly revealed, since filming was completed. 

In particular, the pollen assemblage seen in the sediment cores that LSU collected. The story [at this link](http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2017/06/underwater_forest_discovered_alabama.html) provides a sort of layman’s primer on everything I’ve gleaned about the forest from my earliest visits to Kristine’s research. It also has a lot of pictures of the site and a link to the Underwater Forest film. A quick read might be useful to help formulate your questions.

* [*The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is Possible*](https://amzn.to/2ywA1YX)
* [*Climate Change: A New Story*](https://amzn.to/2yx4k1Q)

On his podcast: A New and Ancient Story, Charles interviews a series of extraordinary guests: activists and healers, scientists and spiritual teachers, artists and entrepreneurs, indigenous people and those from the elite. Topics revolve around concepts of interbeing and “technologies of reunion”

&#x200B;

In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover many things, including:

\- The myth of separation and of self

\- Why our existing stories are destroying our planet

\- How consciousness and Eastern medicine can teach us about the nature of reality

\- Which technologies Charles is most worried about

\- The problem with the stories society tells itself

\- Why past technologies and practices are needed for future progress

\- How psychedelics can shift the human consciousness forward

\- Why we are likely headed to a new structure for civilization

\- How to make miracles happen

\- Why Charles is worried about soil health and the future of our planet

\- The reason science is sometimes wrong and often late

\- Why we need to reimagine climate change now

\- The power of individual actions",,3,0.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/ass3ti/a_new_story_for_climate_change_and_creating_a/,True,The_Syndicate_VC,1747644158.390937,climate science,scientific,,

Has the whole sale price biodiesel price come to price parity with the production costs?  How close is this fuel source to economic viability without subsidies?  Is there a means to dispose of the produced glycerin stream or will this just be treated as waste?


Biodiesel ELI5:
When you combine an alcohol (ethanol, methanol, etc.) with a fat (like vegetable oil), you produce a compound that is chemically identical to traditional diesel.  This means that it can be stored in the same tanks and pipelines used today.

Commercial biodiesel has been previously nonviable due to the cost of refining the inputs, namely the fats (removing acid, water, and other impurities) or sourcing the feedstocks in the first place.  (We do not want to displace commercial agriculture that supply food for the masses. Also, soybeans are very expensive in dollars and resources to grow.)

This has been changing as alternative sources of fats have been developed (growing in areas that are otherwise unfit for human agriculture, algae based are a few) and the production process has been better designed to be more efficient.

We were broadly interested in how and why facial shape has evolved in humans in our recent history and wanted to focus on one long-standing hypothesis: that differences in nose shape in humans have evolved due to adaptation to climate. We found support for two things: i) nostril width and nose width seem to be evolving faster across populations than expected under genetic drift alone (read: due to divergent selection), and ii) these differences may be driven, at least partly, by local adaptation to temperature and humidity

You may experience a heightened awareness of birds during these early weeks of spring—particularly at 4 a.m. when neighborhood chirping seems ridiculously loud. I study birds year round! AMA!","Hi reddit!

I’ve been fascinated by birds ever since taking a class in ornithology as an undergraduate. Now, as a professor and researcher at U of I, a lot of what I do is about bird populations and how they ""tick"" and how to conserve them. For example, in one project we tracked the role of robins in the spread of West Nile virus    (http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vbz.2007.0123). Although the primary culprit in spreading the virus is the common mosquito, robins are accomplices. They’re what we call ""super-amplifiers"" of the disease. Crows and jays just can't handle West Nile virus and they die when they get it, but robins do much better. They are a competent host of the disease. And, because robins are common in urban environments, they might be part of the smoking gun for why and where the disease is and isn't.
 
Since 1986, I’ve been involved in a project with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute studying bird populations in Panama’s Soberania National Park—approximately 100 square miles of protected rainforest. It’s also home to well over 500 bird species. Because we have over 30 years of data, we were able to study the effect of changing environmental conditions and its relationship to bird populations.
 
Because the tropics are relatively stable with milder seasonal change, tropical birds may not be able to handle environmental disturbances as easily, physiologically or behaviorally, as temperate-zone birds. Those Midwest birds who wake us up while it’s still dark are able to make it through below-zero winters and 100-degree summers—environmental stress that tropical birds never experience. Consequently, tropical ecosystems and animal populations may be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
 
Here’s a link to the full paper about the research that appeared in Nature Climate Change:

The Hockey Stick quickly became a central object of attack by those looking to discredit the case for concern over human-caused climate change.  As I describe in my book ‘The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars’, many of attacks have been directed at me personally, in the form of threats and intimidation efforts carried out by individuals, front groups, and politicians tied to fossil fuel interests.

My name is Rebekah L. Rogers and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioinformatics at UNC Charlotte. My research focuses on genome structure changes and new gene formation.


I recently published a study titled [“Excess of genomic defects in a woolly mammoth on Wrangel Island”](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006601&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=ama&utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0412) with Montgomery Slatkin. We reanalyzed genome sequences for two woolly mammoths. One specimen came from Siberia at a time when mammoths were happy and healthy. The other comes from a small population that existed on Wrangel Island until 3700 years ago, another 600 years after all mainland mammoths had gone extinct.



We found that bad mutations were accumulating in woolly mammoth genomes just before they went extinct. The accumulation of bad mutations is consistent with mathematical theories predicting that natural selection becomes inefficient in small populations. Under these circumstances, bad mutations could accumulate in genomes that normally would be weeded out by competition. The mammoth from Wrangel Island had 50% more of its genes broken compared with the mainland mammoth from much earlier.  Several different types of bad mutations had accumulated— large deletions in the DNA, retrogenes (which reflect the action of selfish virus-like DNA sequences), and single letters that would cause genes to terminate early. Many of the broken genes are urinary proteins and the olfactory receptors that detect them — genes important for social signaling. We also discovered that the mammoth from the island had mutations that would give him a shiny satin coat.



These results may be important for conservation. They suggest that other very small populations of endangered species might undergo the same type of mutational meltdown.  In our mammoths, we found that it required many generations to see a signal as strong as what we observed in the Wrangel Island genome.  **The sooner we can intervene to bring endangered species back to normal levels, the better off their genomes will be.** There are many factors that influence extinction. Climate change, habitat destruction, and hunting were all very important for the mammoths’ demise. Still, these bad mutations certainly did not help them as the struggled to adapt on the island.

66tz52,collapse,skeptical,Essay: Why a 'Climate Protest' on 'Earth Day' when Trump is cutting the budget for science in my opinion is 'Collapse Worthy'.,"
Big business (Trump, et all... (from his billionaire buddies through to complete billionaire strangers)).......need to ignore climate change to ensure they don't loose millions, or even billions.

Much of what they're worth is in peoples perceptions of their businesses - in stocks and such.

As climate change and **collapse** become bigger concerns for a  larger number of people, that effects their worth negatively. Their business investment portfolios don't look as good long-term anymore. (beach-front property, oil investments, crop land investments)          
Add to this that their portfolios are already getting hammered by the current economic decline of several large world markets.

The billionaires HAVE TO deny collapse (in part climate change, and peak oil (which has been redefined a few times already)) to **protect their wealth**.     
            
Maybe a financial climate change blow to their wealth could have been taken ""on the jaw"" - **if the economy was doing well. It's not.** *So they take one of the only other options of denying climate change.*

Trump IS NOT STUPID when he deny's climate change. He's greedy. He wants his worth to remain.             
Cutting funding for research will help take the pressure off by reducing new collapse/climate change headlines.        
In fact, when he denied climate change, I believe some markets (DOW?) actually *rose*... as big business realised many of the regulations preventing them maximising profits would be going away. He knew that would happen. It's an easy one to work out. 

**Imagine how much angrier people would be if he didn't say ""It's a Chinese conspiracy!""**              

.... instead he told the truth.... ""I would lose a great deal of money to recognise climate change, so I WILL NOT!""

They'd march on his location and have his head on a spike.           
Instead they vent with ""BUFFOON!"" and shout louder in the hopes it makes sense to him eventually. **(It never will, because it's a sham ""ignorance"")**

Or a smaller scale lie: Imagine you and I worked together, and I kept ""forgetting"" to count up some stock in the evening, and everyone gets told off by the manager each morning.           
People would say ""Look SarahC, you've gotta try harder, here - add this  reminder to your phone. Put this post it note on your door! They'll all help you remember!""

Secretly I DO remember every night, I just DON'T CARE about making the team look bad. I feign stupidity, so people will keep trying to help  me understand, WHILE I DO NOTHING.

What if instead, I said ""Fuck you, it wasn't my job to do when I started. I'm NOT counting that stock!""

MAJOR rage. Suggestions of ""Cache you outside!"" for a beating.

See how ""ignorance"" panders to people's sense of care?

A telling truth - **Trump is taking steps to protect his lands from sea level rise.**

Actions speak louder than words?

Now scientists are MARCHING ON WASHINGTON!

I could almost laugh (or is it tears?) - **TRUMP GETS IT!** They wont do fuck all to change his beliefs, because he knows they're right right now!

He will never admit it, because it would wipe **billions from his, and people like him who have massive self-worth**.

Scientists think they can get him to listen to reason? Nope - EVERYONE should be marching, because he's a bloody money grabbing bastard.

Even if he isn't a sociopath (I don't think he is) - there's LOTS of ways for people to feel less guilty about being greedy and damaging.

""My charities help people!"" he'd think.              
""Climate change has fucked us all already - time to grab what I can  (financial wealth) before we go down.""                
... and one of the biggies: ""Scientists will work out carbon capture. It's a risk, but I'll be WAY ahead of the game (and American business, and my buddies too).""

That's the same way of thinking when you hate someone speeding ""The stupid jerk will kill someone!""

When **you're** speeding ""I'm late, this is important, AND I'm a careful driver."" (False attribution error)

People need to understand **Trump is delaying any climate action by acting stupid so people will waste time trying to educate the man, rather than bombing his golf courses, and digging out the foundations of his buildings.**

I DON'T believe scientists will make gigaton carbon capture, and I think we CAN slow changes down to save more peoples lives. Trump is one big business, we have to change them ALL The multi millionaires, the multi billionaires.

abicrb,sustainability,action-oriented,Signs of collapse 2018,"Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for 3 years now nick-named [“Signs of collapse”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.

Can't See The Food For The Trees

The U.S. only has about 10% of the forest they started with 400 years ago. Humans now destroy 20 million acres of forest every year. We already slashed and burned 50% of the rainforests on earth. Most of the destruction has been in the last 50 years.  

Rainforest soil is of poor quality and quantity so farming it only degrades it even faster. Rainforest roots are so dense, they don't require robust and plentiful soils. So, planting mono-cultures, such as soy or palm oil, in these thin, weak soils only erodes them quicker. Trees are living batteries of energy essential for the propagation of the bio-diversity of life on earth. We are draining the battery for all life on earth for foods like palm oil. The same palm oil Germans burn in their diesel cars. Indonesia will destroy 98% of its rainforests by 2025.

In 2007, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2015 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

In 2014, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2030 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

The IPCC says we can make this change because of what they call ""negative-emissions bio-energy"". meaning we will get energy by consuming plant matter in a way that pulls more CO2 out of the air than it emits; for which, by the way, no such technology exists, and the kicker is, they say, that we will need 1.5 billion acres of NEW farmland to do it. That much farmland is about the size of India, which is equal to nearly 50% of all the arable land on earth. 

The acronym for this fantasy is BECCS (Bio-Energy Carbon Capture & Storage). The real acronym is BS (Bull Shit). Where do you think we'll find all this new farmland? The rainforests. World hunger will guarantee it. Why? Read on.

The Chinese are buying up farmland all over the earth.

Because we add 1 MILLION PEOPLE TO EARTH EVERY 5 DAYS (each who would very much like to eat every day for at least 50 years), we will have to grow more food over the these next 50 years than we grew in all of the last 10,000 years, combined. This is called math, get used to it, it will rule your life. We already converted nearly half the earth's surface into cities and farmland.

To feed nine billion people all at once for all their lives means we will need 12 million acres of brand new farmland EVERY year for 30 years. Instead, we are losing 24 million acres of farmland EVERY year. We are losing soil at twice the rate we need to grow it just to be able to eat, never mind the additional requirements of BECCS.

This will happen when all our new solar panels and wind mills stop working and become expensive junk we can't afford to replace or recycle in times of shortages in water, food, energy, minerals and civility. Recycling their component alloys costs more and uses more energy than mining for them does. Each time a mineral is recycled it loses its quality and usefulness.

Over the next 50 years energy demand will double (at the same time we have to reduce emissions at least 50%) because over 2 billion rural refugees will move to cities, and 75% of the infrastructure they require does not even exist yet.  Concrete production is a super-emitter of carbon into the air. 

Yet, it also takes 10 times the amount of rated renewable energy to close one equally rated fossil fuel plant simply because renewable energy is intermittent and fossil energy is not. It will be a physical impossibility to meet all future demand with 100% renewable energy and reduce emissions all at the same time. Half the renewable power in Europe comes from burning imported wood from all over the world. Rainforests are slashed and burned in South America and Indonesia to grow soy and palm oils that are exported Europe to burn in German cars.

e0xahf,collapse,skeptical,"It´s 2019, thirty years after the first international climate conference and we´re still on track for four degree celsius","Thirty years ago the first climate conference was held in the Netherlands, in Noordwijk. Governments came within a hair of making binding commitments to reduce their emissions. The Americans however sent Sununu to keep track of their own representative at the conference. It became clear eventually that no binding commitments would be made.

The fossil fuel industry was spooked however and began a massive lobbying and disinformation campaign, intended to convince the American public and its representatives that you can simply use the atmosphere as a waste dump and expect no consequences to follow. This led to two presidents who walked away from Kyoto and the Paris accords and no genuinely binding commitments have been made since.

Progressives were kept sedated with promises of a bright green future where electricity would be renewable and cars would run on electricity, but in the absence of binding commitments, these new technologies merely serve to supplement our energy budget, rather than displacing fossil fuels. When people switched to new SUV´s, the rise in oil consumption entirely offset all the entire rise in electric vehicles. Yet, we´re supposed to believe that these new technologies will solve our problem for us.

The consequence is that even today, according to experts we are still on track for [more than four degree Celsius of global warming:](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/world-fossil-fuel-production-rise-guarantees-missing-paris-climate-goals/)

>Carbon emissions from fossil fuel use totaled 37.1 billion tonnes in 2018, a new record. Substantially reducing those emissions will never happen without reducing fossil fuel production, says Michael Lazarus, a lead author of “The Production Gap Report” and the director of Stockholm Environment Institute’s U.S. Center.

&#x200B;

>Using publicly-available government documents, the report found that countries’ plans to increase production of coal, oil, and gas amounts to 120 percent more in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to 2.7 degrees F. Those plans include producing 280 percent more coal. That puts the world on a path to more than 7.2 degrees F (4 degrees C) of warming, says Lazarus.

Keep in mind that four degree Celsius globally tends to mean [around six degree](https://archive.ipcc.ch/report/graphics/images/Assessment%20Reports/AR5%20-%20WG1/SPM/FigSPM-08.jpg) on land, because the land warms more than the ocean.

There is nowhere to flee to. If you flee to Siberia, Alaska or Northern Canada, you´re probably worse off, because the warming there is much more intense than elsewhere. The permafrost will face [abrupt thaw](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0614-6), from one year to the next. This leads to infrastructural collapse, drought and a sudden temperature jump in these places, resulting in massive unprecedented forest fires.

At 410 parts per million, the planet should have already warmed far more than it actually has, but some of this warming is hidden from us by toxic air pollution. Please keep in mind that the IPCC projections don´t properly take all of the feedback loops into consideration that come into play. Freshwater lake bacteria will start producing methane, bacteria in oceanic dead zones start releasing nitrous oxide, the decaying permafrost releases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

We have in fact already reached dangerous levels of warming. It´s not a mystery that we´re facing unprecedented forest fires around the world, this is exactly what we should have expected. Before the IPCC, we had the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases. The Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases wrote:

“…[B]eyond 1 degree C may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damage.”

The reason the world settled on a two degree target is because of an economist, Nordhaus, who assumed through simplistic economic simulations that the world could handle some global warming without harm to the global economy. These economic simulations are vast simplifications that don´t take ecosystem damage into proper consideration. Nordhaus for example arrives at 8.5% GDP reduction for six degree of global warming. And to illustrate how truly ridiculous their projections really are, consider what [Skeptical Science](https://skepticalscience.com/climate-costs-often-underestimated.html) notes about these economic reports:

>A 2010 paper led by the late economist Frank Ackerman found that not until global warming reached 19 degrees C (34 degrees F – a global temperature that is virtually incompatible with life) did the model yield a 50% reduction in economic output.

With projections like this, that policymakers are indirectly exposed to, it´s easy to pretend that no real action needs to be taken. So what the world governments have settled on as a consequence is a trajectory that will mean the end of civilization as we know it and a global mass extinction.

Keep in mind that there are people who knew what was coming. The existence of the problem has been known since the late 19th century and the American Petroleum Institute was explicitly warned as early as 1959. The big fossil fuel companies knew this would be a problem long before the 1989 conference in Naaldwijk. They had plenty of time to react, that´s how we ended up with a massive disinformation campaign.

The big oil companies knew what would happen and even to this day, companies like Shell are still making projections about how the future will look according to them. All their scenarios overshoot two degree of global warming, the IPCC, the Paris accords, all of these attempts at reigning in global warming are just a big joke to these people. 

You can see their scenarios for yourself [here](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/new-lenses-on-the-future/_jcr_content/par/relatedtopics.stream/1519787235340/77705819dcc8c77394d9540947e811b8c35bda83/scenarios-newdoc-english.pdf). My younger brother once applied for a job with Shell, they had him do some standard personality tests and told him it´s not going to work because he has a moral compass. That´s what these organizations do, they screen applicants to make sure they only hire self-absorbed greedy people without a soul.

In a sane world there would be a Nuremberg tribunal, where people like the Shell directors would be thrown in jail. They have advertisements everywhere marketing green energy, but keep in mind what the real purpose is. It´s lipstick on a pig. They show you their green bullshit, while they openly plan on overshooting two degree Celsius behind the scenes.

Nobody is brave enough to hold these people truly accountable. They annihilated the only planet we know of with life, but they are met with signs and slogans. Try to imagine this is Independence Day and the aliens have made it clear that they will extract our planet´s natural resources and kill us all, but people react by holding up signs and slogans. Try to imagine you are living in the Warsaw ghetto in april 1943 and the people there declare that they are going to engage in civil disobedience against the Nazi´s. The trains are riding and the people are responding by laying down on the tracks until the police escort them. That´s the situation we´re dealing with.

b91hql,science,scientific,Science discussion series: We are an interdisciplinary group of water science professionals and we’re here to discuss safe drinking water. Ask us anything!,"[Hi Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png)! Today's discussion is coming to us from the [**National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)**](http://www.nationalacademies.org/) and is a collaboration between r/science, [**LabX**](https://labx.org/), and [**the Water, Science and Technology Board**](http://dels.nas.edu/wstb)! 

## We are panel of diverse water science professionals ready to answer your questions about all things related to drinking water. 

Water is a ubiquitous phenomenon! But its visual abundance—from its constant flow out of taps and fountains to the immensity of our oceans—can mask the fact that 1 in 7 people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water (that’s over 1 billion people!). Furthermore, in places like New Orleans or The Netherlands, water can seem like an impending threat without the proper means to safely contain it, or productively incorporate it into our daily lives. The broader water/society interface raises questions about drinking water’s vulnerability to climate change and society’s vulnerability to ageing infrastructure for adequate and safe sourcing, treatment, and distribution. Poor drinking water quality can result from pollution from sources such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, corrosion of lead from distribution pipes, or treatment facility contamination by man-made materials such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Emerging innovations in grey/green infrastructure, stewardship programs to reduce man-made contaminants, desalination technology, and international efforts to increase access to safe water on a global scale might help preserve and increase Earth’s water supply and society’s value of it. All of these issues, and more, are on our collective radar and we look forward to discussing them with you. Ask us anything! 

Our discussion panel guests today are:

1. **Will Logan** (u/Will_Logan_ICIWaRM) is currently the Director at the International Center for Integrated Water Resources Management (ICIWaRM), which is part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Previously, Will was the Science Attaché for the US Mission to UNESCO and he served for almost a decade on the Water, Science, and Technology Board at the National Academies of Sciences. Will holds a Ph.D. in Earth Sciences/Hydro-geology from Waterloo University and was an Assistant Professor of Hydro-geology at George Washington University. 

2. **Ellen de Guzman** (u/Ellen_de_Guzman) is currently the Senior Water Officer in the Middle East and North Africa Bureau at USAID. Ellen has managed projects spanning rural reconstruction, humanitarian and disaster response, alternative livelihoods, food security, agriculture, water and sanitation. Prior to USAID, Ellen worked for the National Academies of Sciences, where she provided policy research support to develop federal policies on managing subsurface water contamination, the Clean Water Act, sustainable water and environmental management in the California Bay-Delta, and invasive species in ballast water. 

3. **Jin Shin** (u/Jin_Shin_WSSC) is currently the Water Quality Division Manager at WSSC (Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission), where he has worked for nearly 15 years.

b8xkdg,sustainability,action-oriented,Signs of Collapse 2019 Q1,"Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for just over three years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.

Energy Research & Social Science [Volume 59](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22146296/59/supp/C), January 2020, 101281

**Abstract**

Cryptocurrency mining uses significant amounts of energy as part of the proof-of-work time-stamping scheme to add new blocks to the chain. Expanding upon previously calculated energy use patterns for mining four prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero), we estimate the per coin economic damages of air pollution emissions and associated human mortality and climate impacts of mining these cryptocurrencies in the US and China. Results indicate that in 2018, each $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the US and $0.37 in China. The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” roughly match each $1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of policy implications.

5mxdig,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: We just published a paper showing recent ocean warming had been underestimated, and that NOAA (and not Congress) got this right. Ask Us Anything!","#**NB: We will be dropping in starting at 1PM to answer questions.**

---

# Hello there /r/Science!

We are a group of researchers who just published [a new open access paper in *Science Advances*](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601207.full) showing that ocean warming was indeed being underestimated, confirming the conclusion of a paper last year that triggered a series of political attacks. You can find some press coverage of our work at [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-pause-in-ocean-warming/), [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/04/noaa-challenged-the-global-warming-pause-now-new-research-says-the-agency-was-right/?utm_term=.e9b8eb3f3628), and [the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/global-warming-hiatus-never-happened-say-climate-scientists-1.3922378). One of the authors, Kevin Cowtan, has [an explainer on his website](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/ihsst2016/background.html) as well as [links to the code and data](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/ihsst2016/methods.html) used in the paper.

For backstory, in 2015 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) updated its global temperature dataset, showing that their previous data had been underestimating the amount of recent warming we've had. The change was mainly from their updated ocean data (i.e. their sea surface temperature or ""SST"") product. 

The NOAA group's updated estimate of warming formed the basis of high profile paper in Science ([Karl et al. 2015](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469)), which joined a growing chorus of papers (see also [Cowtan and Way, 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.2297/abstract); [Cahill et al. 2015](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/8/084002); [Foster and Rahmstorf 2016](http://docdro.id/pwnUlm7)) pushing back on the idea that there had been a ""pause"" in warming.

This led to Lamar Smith (R-TX), the Republican chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee to accuse NOAA of deliberately ""altering data"" for nefarious ends, and issue a series of public attacks and subpoenas for internal communications that were characterized as [""fishing expeditions""](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/10/30/global_warming_lamar_smith_s_conspiracy_ideations.html), [""waging war""](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2015/1119/Why-is-Lamar-Smith-waging-war-on-a-NOAA-global-warming-study), and a [""witch hunt""](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22112015/ranking-congresswoman-defends-NOAA-climate-change-scientists-from-witch-hunt-lamar-smith).

Rather than subpoenaing people's emails, we thought we would check to see if the Karl et al. adjustments were kosher a different way- by doing some science! 

We knew that a big issue with SST products had to do with the transition from mostly ship-based measurements to mostly buoy-based measurements. Not accounting for this transition properly could hypothetically impart a cool bias, i.e. cause an underestimate in the amount of warming over recent decades. So we looked at three ""instrumentally homogeneous"" records (which wouldn't see a bias due to changeover in instrumentation type, because they're from one kind of instrument): only buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats. 

We compared these to the major SST data products, including the older (ERSSTv3b) and newer (ERSSTv4) NOAA records as well as the HadSST3 (UK's Hadley Centre) and COBE-SST (Japan's JMA) records. We found that the older NOAA SST product was indeed underestimating the rate of recent warming, and that the newer NOAA record appeared to correctly account for the ship/buoy transition- i.e. the NOAA correction seems like it was a good idea! We also found that the HadSST3 and COBE-SST records appear to underestimate the amount of warming we've actually seen in recent years.

I have worked on solutions to climate change since 1988 and I will be addressing the recent Paris negotiations. AMA!","Hi Reddit,

Last year, I retired from Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (the only chemist on the faculty!), where I founded and directed the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy (<http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CIERP>) for 22 years. I supervised many masters’ and doctoral students during that time, including the co-chair of the Paris climate negotiations. I continue to work on climate science and policy, energy, water, forests and oceans to develop scientifically valid and effective strategies and policies. I served as a lead author on five IPCC reports over a 19-year period. Until recently I served as Chief Scientist at Earthwatch Institute (<http://earthwatch.org/>) and continue to serve as the Chair of their Science Committee. I also serve on the board of directors of Woods Hole Research Center (<http://whrc.org/>), ranked as the most influential climate think tank for the past two years, and several additional environmental science and consensus building organizations.

The science of climate change is complex, and the politics are more so. I have always found the interaction between the two to be fascinating, and remember being shocked as a young scientist that science did not always determine the political outcome of a policy process. I want to share with you the role of science in the outcome of the Paris climate negotiation that just ended on December 11th, 2015.

A bit of history: back in the 1980s, a group of scientists convinced some governments that based on their research, the release of heat trapping gases into the atmosphere would heat the earth to a point where there could be uncontrollable and irreversible warming with devastating consequences for all life, including humans. This science prompted two actions. The first was to create the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide scientific input to governments on the science, impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation of climate change. The second was to negotiate an international treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that was signed by 154 nations in 1992. The Paris negotiations were the 21st meeting of the parties to the original treaty, and its actions both utilized and ignored science in the final outcome.

I invite you to join me in a discussion about how science and policy came together and diverged over issues like the 2oC global temperature goal during the recent Paris talks.

I'll be back at 1 pm EST (10 AM PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!

**EDIT IN CLOSING:**

Thank you all for your engagement, and your thoughtful questions. It has been very gratifying to hear your concerns. Let me close with one final thought. So many actions to address climate change have many additional benefits for providing sustainable energy to all and lift people out of poverty. There would be far less damage to the planet and our health if we can make the shift away form fossil fuels. As I said earlier, we also need to do Restorative Development to mobilize the biosphere so that we improve our forests and land quality every time we use them instead of constantly degrading them. Perhaps, you will enjoy one of my favorite cartoons as a closing.

We’re Laura Stevens and Dr. Sarah Das, glaciologists at MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, here to talk about all things ice! AMA!","Yesterday we published a [paper in Nature on supraglacial lake drainages on the Greenland Ice Sheet](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=50242&tid=3622&cid=217909). Supraglacial lakes form on the surface of the ice sheet during the summer, when temperatures get above freezing in the daytime. In a 2008 study, we discovered that these lakes, some of which are miles wide, can drain in a matter of hours through long cracks known as hydro-fractures that open in the lakebed. These drainage events send a flood of meltwater comparable to Niagra Falls thousands of feet straight down to the bottom of the ice sheet.  The meltwater causes the ice to temporarily speed up, moving more ice to the edge of the ice sheet where it calves off into the ocean as icebergs. It’s important to know where and when lakes will drain in order to predict how fast the ice sheet is moving and how much the ice sheet contributes to sea level rise.  

Since that study in 2008 we have been working hard to figure out what triggers these hydro-fractures, and what that might mean for the future of the ice sheet (and for people elsewhere on the planet) in a warming climate. We do this by traveling every summer to lakes on the ice sheet via helicopter, setting up GPS stations around the lakes, and then using our measurements to observe how the ice sheet surface moves during lake drainage events. We found that enough meltwater gets down to the bottom of the ice sheet before the lake drains to cause the ice sheet surface to be pushed up and stretched. This stretching causes new fractures to form, and once one of those fractures intersects the lake, water from the lake drives the crack open and the lake is history.

We hope that our responses advanced the conversation about global climate change and possible solutions that include climate engineering.  We certainly enjoyed this interaction.

Hi reddit! 

I’m Ken Caldeira and I work on a broad array of issues including the physical climate system, global energy systems, ocean acidification, and geoengineering. With the exception of the ocean acidifcation work, all of our research is based on performing simulations using computer models. Solar geoengineering involves trying to cool the Earth by deflecting some incoming sunlight away from our planet. Studies have shown that actions like putting small particles in the stratosphere could reflect some sunlight away from the Earth, potentially taking our climate back to a point similar to pre-industrial revolution.  Of course, we know for sure about only one habitable planet, and toying around with this planet at the required scale would pose great risks -- but allowing the Earth to warm from our greenhouse gas emissions also poses grave risks. Given that it is going to take time to transform our energy system into one that does not dump its waste in the atmosphere, what is the best path forward?

I’m Ben van der Pluijm and I work in hazards geology and societal impacts of global change. The goal of 2016’s Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) is ideal, but unlikely from voluntary greenhouse gas emission reductions alone.  Building on our remarkable history of engineering applications to overcoming societal challenges, climate engineering should be included as a viable solution for reducing the impacts of global warming.  Climate engineering takes two approaches: (1) Carbon dioxide removal, and (2) solar radiation management.  The former addresses the cause of climate warming by removing greenhouse gas from the atmosphere (""treat the illness"").  The latter offsets the warming effects of greenhouse gases by allowing Earth to absorb less solar radiation (""treat the symptoms"").  Given their worldwide impact, planning must occur on a global scale, involving all nations, large and small, rich and poor, and not be limited to a few technologically advanced, wealthy countries.

We’re looking forward to answering questions about environmental change and dealing with the impacts for human society, and whether various geoengineering techniques could really be expected to reduce climate damage and decrease damage to both ecosystems and people.

60udlh,science,scientific,"PLOS Science Wednesday: We're Kaitlin Raimi, Paul Stern, and Alex Maki, we research how to talk about climate change, Ask Us Anything!","Hi Reddit,

My name is [Kaitlin Raimi](http://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/kaitlin-raimi) and I am an Assistant Professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on how people think and act when it comes to climate change, including how social motivations can promote or prevent sustainable solutions. I'm particularly interested in how people compare their own beliefs and behaviors to those of other people, how the desire to make a good impression can influence people to mitigate climate change, and how one adopting one sustainable behavior affects later environmental decisions. I also have ongoing work on how framing climate change in different ways affects people's understanding of climate change and support for climate policies.


Together with my colleagues [Paul Stern](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/BECS/DBASSE_068036) and [Alex Maki](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/viee/profiles/Alex-Maki.php), I recently published a paper titled [""The Promise and Limitations of Using Analogies to Improve Decision-Relevant Understanding of Climate Change""](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171130&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=ama&utm_campaign=redditama-0322) in the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/).


My name is Alex Maki and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment and the Vanderbilt Climate Change Research Network. My research uses theory-based behavior change interventions to understand and influence environmental (e.g., energy use), health (e.g., eating choices), and prosocial (e.g., volunteerism) behaviors. Specifically, I am interested in how interventions can help people initiate and maintain changes to multiple, related behaviors over time (e.g., both conserve energy and water at home). I also examine the social dynamics surrounding environmental behaviors, including who chooses to talk to other people (e.g., friends or family) about environmental issues, and how we can help people have more constructive conversations about important environmental issues, including climate change.


My name is Paul Stern.  For over two decades I was staff director of the Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change at the U.S. National Research Council.  At the same time, I have been conducting research with colleagues outside the Council on topics that have included household energy consumption, the effectiveness of policies to reduce greenhouse has emissions by changing consumer behavior, and people's understanding of various kinds of environmental risks.  Understanding the risks of climate change is a real challenge because of its long-term nature and the difficulty of making confident predictions of what risks particular communities will face.  This paper is part of an effort to find ways to help people think through the risks without having to understand all the scientific details.
 

We wanted to know whether using analogies helps people understand key factors that are important for climate change decisions, including uncertainties about when and where serious damage may occur, its unprecedented and progressive nature, and trade-offs in limiting climate change. Specifically, across two studies, we looked at whether comparing climate change to medical decision-making, disaster preparedness, or courtroom trials helped people to understand these issues. We found that disaster preparedness and a courtroom trial analogy weren't very helpful, and that none of the analogies helped people understand the basic science of climate change. However, we did find that comparing climate change to a medical decision helped people--especially political conservatives--to to better recognize several decision-relevant attributes of climate change.

c18wl0,climatechange,action-oriented,What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?,"I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

c11bjp,collapse,skeptical,"A collapse is coming, capitalism has destroyed the world. Can we take advantage of the fact we are cognizant of this?","Shit is going to get bad in the next 20 or 30 years, if not much sooner. Capitalism is without a doubt responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. It encourages the unsustainable exploitation of every natural resource on this planet, maximizing short  term profits over every other possible motivation. The fact you are reading this right now means you likely have come to a similar conclusion. 

We cannot change these facts. The end is already written for human society, at least as we know it. The vast majority of people in the world have their heads in the sand, willfully ignorant that society will all come crashing down much sooner than they expect. I think the only option we, as individuals cognizant of this, really have left at this point is to the exploit the existing system to our own benefit. 

At the top of my list is securing a place to live in an area of the world which will be minimally affected by climate change. I'm not sure where yet, I hope I still have a little time to research this topic thoroughly and make my plans. Another thing I have been considering is how various facets of the world economy will change as a result of climate change. What can I invest in now to allow me the means to  secure shelter, food, water and safety when shit really hits the fan? 

As climate change becomes more pronounced, growing enough food to feed the ever growing human population will become tougher and tougher. Global supply chains will break down, millions of people who depend on food being imported from halfway around the world will starve. Humans will turn to science to fill the gaps, crops genetically engineered to grow in inhospitable environments, meat grown in petri dishes in a lab, technology will not be our savior but it  may stave off the inevitable for a few years. Companies which offer this hope will make billions in the years before the collapse.  Can I leverage this fact to gain security for myself before everything falls apart?

I have been working on an ongoing project for three and a half year now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

But our unsustainable use of the Earth's resources is beginning to threaten the health of those ecosystems, limiting their capacity to store carbon. I study how the world's trees and soils are changing under the influence of human activity, and the consequences of these changes for on-going climate change. 

In 2016, we published a [paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7631/full/nature20150.html) revealing that atmospheric warming will drive the loss of approximately 55 gigatonnes of carbon from the soil into the atmosphere by 2050, with the potential to accelerate climate change by 17% on top of current expectations. We also [showed](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v525/n7568/full/nature14967.html) that there are over 3 trillion trees on Earth which are able to absorb much of this carbon, but their capacity to do so is being hindered by the loss of ~10 billion trees each year caused by deforestation, fire and disease/pests. Understanding and preserving these terrestrial ecosystems at a global scale is absolutely critical in the fight against poverty and climate change.

Greetings Reddit r/science community! 


 I am Andy Jorgensen, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences at the University of Toledo where I have been on the faculty since 1988. My areas of specialization are physical and analytical chemistry with an emphasis on environmental chemistry, including how students and others learn about the scientific principles in these fields.



For the past several years I have been developing educational materials focused on the phenomenon of climate change and how people can best understand what is happening with our climate, why it is happening, and what can be done to reduce the negative consequences which are expected in the future. As part of this effort I have created an interactive presentation on climate change which I have given more than 150 times to students, teachers, professionals and members of the general public. Using personal response devices those in my audiences express their thoughts about climate change as well as respond to factual questions regarding characterizations of our atmosphere and the changes we have seen in modern times. My aim has been to put the science in a context that is relatable to individual’s lives and experiences using reliable data and analogies. Data collected during these sessions indicates that individuals who are presented with factual information are willing to reconsider previous views, including coming to a more realistic view of climate change.


In terms of background, I earned a BS degree in Chemistry from Quincy University and a PhD in Physical Chemistry from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Subsequently I completed a postdoctoral appointment in chemical education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  During sabbatical leaves I served as Washington Fellow of the Council of Scientific Society Presidents and Senior Fellow at the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE).  I worked on chemical research at Argonne Labs in Illinois and at Ecole Polytechnique in Francis.  Finally, I participated in a faculty exchange with Leuphana University in Germany for the purposes of teaching aspects of environmental chemistry.


I also serve as an [ACS Expert](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/experts/andy-jorgensen.html) on the topics of climate change, energy, chemistry of the atmosphere.


In partnership with others associated with NCSE, I have been supported through educational programs at the National Science Foundation and NASA.  One of our products is the website [Climate, Adaptation, e-Learning](http://camelclimatechange.org/index.html ) which has over 300 resources for teaching climate change.


Ask me anything about communicating climate change to non-scientists.


I’ll be back at 12 noon ET (9am PT, 5pm UTC) to answer your questions.

With a background in chemistry and oceanography, I cover the physical sciences, from environmental issues to quantum physics. In my work as a freelance journalist, I’ve contributed to Scientific American, Globe and Mail, and New Scientist, and serve as the science journalist in residence at the University of British Columbia. In my recent Yale Environment 360 story, ""How the World Passed a Carbon Threshold and Why It Matters"" [http://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters], scientists Ralph Keeling and Dana Royer join me to understand what Earth’s climate was like in previous eras of high CO2 levels and portray a sobering picture of where we are headed. Last year marked the first time in several million years that atmospheric concentrations of CO2 passed 400 parts per million. Environmental scientists see this threshold as a clear red line into a danger zone of climate change. But, as humans keep digging up carbon out of the ground and burning it for fuel, what will this mean for our future? 

My name is Ralph Keeling, and I am the Director of the Scripps CO2 Program, Professor of Geochemistry at UC San Diego, and Principal Investigator for the Atmospheric Oxygen Research Group at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  My research interests include measurements of variations in atmospheric oxygen, recent perturbations to the global carbon cycle, air-sea gas exchange, detection of ocean heat storage and transport using atmospheric gases and Paleoclimate theory. I continue to research the [“Keeling Curve,”](http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/history_legacy/keeling_curve_lessons) which was developed my father Charles David Keeling in 1958, at Scripps CO2 Program. 

My name is Dana Royer and I am a Climatologist and Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Wesleyan University. I explore how fossil plants can be used to reconstruct ancient environments (especially CO2, temperature, and climate sensitivity), and the (paleo-) physiological underpinnings behind these plant-environment relationships. Recent and current projects include the reconstruction of paleo-atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from the stomatal distributions in plant leaves, and the development of mechanistically-grounded proxies for climate and leaf ecology from the size and shape of fossil leaves. I also compile ancient carbon dioxide records and investigate the strength of [carbon dioxide-temperature coupling over multi-million-year timescales](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-earth-100815-024150).

3evxgv,science,scientific,"[Science AMA Series] American Chemical Society AMA: Hi, I am Kimberly Prather, a Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at UC San Diego. We fly through clouds and break waves in the lab to study how aerosols impact our clouds, weather, and climate. AMA!","Hi Reddit-I am a Professor of Chemistry at UC San Diego. I hold a joint appointment in the Dept. of Chemistry and Biochemistry and also Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I have spent over 20 years studying the impact of atmospheric aerosols on air pollution, human health, and climate. Aerosols are solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere, which range from soot emitted from cars and wildfires to natural sources such as dust and sea spray.  Because of their extreme complexity, our overall understanding of how much they are affecting climate through interactions with clouds represents the single largest uncertainty in our overall understanding of climate change. Over the past two decades, my research group has performed field studies around the world on ships, aircraft, and in mobile laboratories aimed at determining the major sources of atmospheric aerosols.  Most recently, by performing unique aircraft measurements inside clouds, we have directly determined which particles seed clouds and how different sources can affect precipitation.  Surprisingly, we discovered that dust from as far away as Africa and microbes picked up over the oceans can affect the amount of snowfall over the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.  Yes, indeed aerosols from one continent can influence weather over another thousands of miles away!

I serve as the Director of an NSF Center for Chemical Innovation called the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment (http://caice.ucsd.edu, @CAICECCI). In CAICE, we transferred the complexity of the real world into a laboratory setting to perform controlled chemistry experiments that can be used to explain atmospheric observations. The Center brings together chemists with marine biologists and oceanographers to perform studies in a unique ocean-atmosphere facility which uses real seawater, breaking waves, and biology to control the composition of seawater and sea spray.  Using this new approach, we are rapidly learning new things about the ocean-atmosphere system. See a recent video posted on our most recent publication:
 
Prather, et al. (2013), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, “Bringing the ocean into the laboratory to probe the chemical complexity of sea spray aerosol”. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBX4Vl6-SMM))
 
So feel free to ask me anything about aerosols, clouds, aircraft studies, our wave machine, CAICE, atmospheric microbes, and chemistry. Also, happy to discuss steps we can take to help our planet and my thoughts on the importance of communicating our exciting science findings to the public. Finally, I am open to discussing my own career path to becoming an atmospheric chemistry professor.

I will be back at 1 pm ET to answer your questions. AMA!

EDIT I am here and ready to start answering questions. Very exciting to see so much interest in this topic. 

I am here at UC San Diego with a number of my students, CAICE faculty, and members of our research team--Dr. Doug Collins (CAICE managing director), Prof. Bob Continetti, Prof. Francesco Paesani, Jackie Dowling (undergrad visiting from Carleton College), Robin Richardson (UCSD undergrad), Kathryn Nadler (UCSD grad student), and Nicole Campbell (UCSD grad student)....We are going to start answering questions now.

I noticed there are a number of questions about cloud seeding so I will just answer broadly up here to start.  Many people are asking if we should /start/ cloud seeding but we already are doing so in many places in the world, including California since the late 1940's.  Little known fact.  We seed clouds in California due to our interest in hydroelectric power. The mechanism for enhancement is still not fully resolved and sometimes it appears to work, and other times it does not.  The question we are asking in our studies is how are the aerosol seeds produced by humans (aka pollution) affecting our rain and snowfall?  The idea is if you put too many (aerosol) seeds into a cloud, you make many tiny droplets that cannot grow big enough to fall--thus you can turn off precipitation in some regions with high levels of pollution.  When we went to study this in a region over our major watershed, we found a surprise--that Mother Nature was seeding clouds using aerosols transported from far away (Africa!) produced by natural sources, including dust and microbes. Nature appears to have figured out the perfect cloud seeding recipe which turns out to be quite different from the ones humans use.  Dust and microbes make ice in clouds at higher altitudes which grow and then fall and scavenge drops along the way leading to copious snowfall at the ground!  So...now I will go down thru the questions and answer those that this answer does not address.

We're the Lancet Commission on Public Health and Climate, a group of medical doctors, climate scientists, economists and energy experts that have recently released a major report on our policy options for reducing the health impacts of climate change.  Formally titled [Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health](http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/climate-change), this report not only details the many different ways global warming is a medical emergency, but more importantly it lays out some of our options for confronting this crisis. 

We can answer questions about how climate change impacts health (through things like heat waves or malaria) as well as the flip side, what we can do about the problem in terms of policies and economics. It turns out that when you switch from coal to low carbon energy, you not only help the climate, but also see an immediate health benefit. Hospital admissions decrease and cardiovascular and respiratory disease rates decrease, overall reducing costs for the healthcare system and improving countless lives, all while reducing carbon pollution. 

Hopefully there are plenty of questions, because we have a number of experts ready to answer!

You might think of Mars as Earth-like, but the South Pole of Mars is a strange and wonderful place unlike anything on Earth. During the winter, while the entire Martian South Pole is shrouded in complete darkness a a growing cap of carbon dioxide ice forms from the condensing atmosphere.  During the spring, carbon dioxide geysers from and loft dust and dirt through cracks in a thawing carbon dioxide ice sheet to the surface where it is believed that surface winds subsequently sculpt the material into dark fans observed from orbit. For nearly 10 years, the HiRISE camera (with 24.7 cm/pixel resolution) aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been imaging these seasonal processes. HiRISE is the highest resolution camera ever to sent to another planet. Hundreds of thousands of dark fans are visible in springtime HiRISE images. Automated computer routines have not been able to accurately identify and outline the individual fans in these images, but a human being intuitively can distinguish and outline these features.  Launched in January 2013, Planet Four (http://www.planetfour.org ) uses human pattern recognition to map the shape and direction of the fans visible in the HiRISE images in order to study the evolution of Mars' climate. Planet Four will also produce the largest areal coverage wind measurement of the Martian surface.

Many of  the surface features of Mars South Pole are sculpted by the never-ending cycle of freezing and thawing of exposed carbon dioxide ice and subsurface water ice. This features includes  'spiders' (radially organized channels carved in the surface), pitted sheets of carbon dioxide ice nicknamed Swiss Cheese Terrain, and channel networks carved by carbon dioxide gas trapped below the thawing ice sheet and also by the freezing and thawing of water ice permafrost. With Planet Four: Terrains (http://terrains.planetfour.org), we need your help to identify these different surfaces in images taken in orbit by the Context Camera (CTX). This is a task that is difficult for computers to do, but the human brain automatically identifies patterns. With your help, Planet Four:Terrains will find new and interesting regions of the Martian South Pole to study. Starting in July 2016 when sunlight returns to the South Pole, we'll point the HiRISE camera to monitor the evolution of these new targets of interest. The HiRISE observations will in the future be shown on the main Planet Four site to learn if there is fan and blotch formation and see how the process compares to other areas on the South Pole.

3dwrac,sustainability,action-oriented,Conventional vs Organic Farming,"I am a conventional farmer in Western Canada (growing wheat, canola, malt barley and oats), and am also a professional engineer (mechanical).  

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)

cy3dr7k,science,scientific,,"Hello Bill. Thanks for doing this AMA. Really glad to see dialogues like this taking place.

I have always been slightly confused as to why there is no sustainability/climate change equivalent to, for example, the World Health Organisation. I understand the role the IPCC plays, however, I feel it is primarily an advisory council rather than an active organisation which takes a hands-on role in promoting/advancing sustainability and climate change globally.

All I mean by this is it seems for most other global crises we are undergoing at the moment there is a recognisable/well-known/household name organisation to coordinate global efforts. For example, everyone knows the UN (global peace-keeping), or the WHO (for world health), or Amnesty International (fighting for human rights) or the Red Cross (for politically neutral humanitarian relief)/oxfam, or WWF (for animal conservation) - and even at a stretch the World Bank (aiming to reduce poverty), or Nato or G8 etc. etc. 

However for global sustainability or 'action against climate change' there doesn't seem to be similar coherent, commonly known organisation that tries to address all the issues involved and to make a concerted effort to produce change. The IPCC is great, don't get me wrong, it's just it doesn't really do anything other than inform other governments/the UN. I think we can all agree this is the slowest route to success, especially considering we require many different countries to agree on some level. The Red Cross or WWF or WHO take active roles in their fields, regardless (ideally) of political motivations/tensions by supplying funding to institutions/research/education, having accessible volunteer programmes for the public to engage with, raising awareness (by having a logo/organisation attached to the concept, particularly helpful for educating children in the long-term), having charity status, as well as all the informing of governments and looking at all the statistics etc. etc.

The IPCC is an organisation within the UN. Rather than an organisation in it's own right, with it's own policies and own motive. It is too driven by the UN and therefore means it has to bow to the member states rather than ploughing on through regardless like many other institutions I have mentioned above do in their respective fields.

I'm just surprised there's no World Environment Agency or something similar which is a household name. So I suppose my question is, why isn't there such an organisation? Or equally, is there one and I'm just being stupendously ignorant? :)

When convincing a skeptic, sometimes circumstantial reasoning comes across more effectively. when they hit me with arguments such as, ""it's exaggerated by left wing groups"" or ""it's all green lobbying and scare mongering"" and especially ""the science is uncertain"", I tend to reply with,

""Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests? 

You know what the biggest difference is between climate science in the 70s versus now? It's a trick question, because no major technology breakthrough has altered any of the early predictions. It was solid science back then. 

That's why Exxon Mobil started its own in house world class climate change research in the late 70s, to get a handle on the magnitude of the problem. Over the next 5 years it would go on to confirm all the worst established predictions from academic research and go beyond it. Investigative journalism revealed that they predicted very accurately what the concentration greenhouse gasses would rise to by 2020. They knew 50 years in advance we would have surpassed 400ppm by now, almost double the 'natural' level. They knew that by now the first undeniable signs of severe clays change would become apparent. It was a time when this problem could be solved with a relatively painless energy transition, avoiding the worst outcomes. 

Knowing all this, Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. 

All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism. Please do give it a read.""

erbq3o3,climatechange,action-oriented,,"Point one is not based in science, at all. The “power” that warms the Earth above the 3 Kelvin of outer space (not absolute zero) is the sun. It pushes over 1300 watts per square meter of energy into Earths system on the approximately 50% of the Earth where the sun shines.  Clouds, the surface of the oceans, ice, and the surface itself reflect some of that energy away.  Part of that energy is absorbed by the atmosphere before it ever reaches the surface. Some of that energy makes it through the atmosphere, past the clouds and is absorbed by the surface. The Earth radiates away the same amount of energy, but the radiation isn’t confined to the dark side of the planet. 

The surface radiates energy, but so does the atmosphere. All matter radiates energy based on the composition of the matter and the temperature. So, a warm atmosphere will radiate energy to space without that energy having come from the surface in the form of IR in the frequency that CO2 can capture. A GHG molecule, such as water vapor, will radiate in IR based on the temperature of that molecule, and it will cool via radiation. 

All other things being equal, more GHGs in the atmosphere must cause increased levels of IR radiation from the atmosphere, with half of that radiation going upwards and away from the surface.  The very first and most reliable test of Climate Change would be the IR brightness of the mid-troposphere. We should have a quantifiable and very easily demonstrated gauge of climate change simply by measuring the change in IR bouncing around at various levels in the atmosphere.",,2,,,,,deck_hand,1747647022.760776,climate science,scientific,t3_c18wl0,c18wl0
erbzawt,climatechange,action-oriented,," - The reason it's detrimental 

It's about effectively framing runaway warming as a threat to us, instead of a threat to wildlife and somewhat of an inconvenience we can engineer our way around:

""We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius

The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years. Adding another 4 degrees Celsius to the top of the natural ice age - warm age temperature cycle.

Calling it global warming doesn't reveal the the implications of the problem the way climate change does. If the mean temperature increases world wide by 2 degrees, than you should not expect the same basic conditions but slightly warmer. Instead, it means macro shifts. 

For instance a monsoon that shifts in landfall location by hundreds of miles will cause droughts where it used to land and floods where it settles. Imagine water shortages for a city like new Delhi with 20+ million people. Imagine failed crops.

Besides warming, 2 degrees will be accompanied with rising sea levels and ocean acidification. This combination of effects is how 2 degrees is projected to eradicate tropical and sub tropical such as the great barrier reef which had been around the time the giant meteor eradicated the dinosaurs and which is the size of Western Europe. Further warming with its accompanied effects may critically reduce other sea life to the extent that it can no longer be relied on to feed three coastal populations in south East Asia.

A planet doesn't need an atmosphere to be warm. The radiation a planet receives from the sun needs to be irradiated out. This is called Radiative Equilibrium.

Now, a planet doesn't emit its own visible light. But it can emit infrared. How? By having a temperature. So the more energy it gets from the sun, the hotter the planet needs to be to maintain Radiative Equilibrium. In other words, it needs to have a Planetary Equilibrium Temperature.

When a planet has an atmosphere, its surface temperature is higher than the theoretical Planetary Equilibrium Temperature. Venus is an extreme example of this.

3. A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

4. We do see it in first world countries! The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.",,1,,,,,Macralicious,1747647022.766104,climate science,scientific,t3_c18wl0,c18wl0

er2o9az,science,scientific,,"This isn't really formatted in the form of a question, but here goes. I often think about genetic engineering and brain machine interfaces. Particularly effective delivery mechanisms for genetic modification, monitoring cell behavior on a cell by cell basis in vivo, as well as the computational potential of DNA in DNA based computers, and the application of ribosomes in building man-made, protein based nano machines. 

I think life extension, gene modification in vivo and curing diseases like cancer or retro viral infections with directed apoptosis are possible in our lifetime. 

What if we could modify a mitochondria (not for the purposes of replacing the mitochondria but as a template for an entirely new artificial organelle with its own metabolism and DNA) to process data, network together on some kind of cloud network, synthesize oligonucleotide sequences from scratch, and express them from its own dna rather than integrating them into the nuclear genome? These mechanics would be all you need to download and express genes like apps without risking the health of the nuclear genome, as well as to monitor the health of the nuclear genome by sequencing and comparing the RNA expressed by it with other cells. Even if the processing capacity of every modified mitochondria was in the kbs, with trillions of cells you'd have an incredible amount of processing capacity and could run programs on the cloud network that are stored directly on DNA. Like running antivirus software that scans for actual viruses. This network could even be programmed to simulate a brain machine interface, giving the individual subjective access to their internal, cellular cloud network. 

There are countless applications. You could run thousands of genetic studies in parallel in a single petri dish. Every cell would be its own lab. And forget labs on a chip when you can directly express any cell type you want by programming it into a live cell culture. You could run these tests in parallel IN VIVO if you wanted.  

And I often imagine the kind of complex mechanics that we could engineer with this level of control. One of the proteins I imagined being expressed from these artificial mitochondria (I call them nanosomes) could lock together passively using modified nucleophiles. I imagined modifying a nucleophile so that it would have a dipole tail rotating on a single carbon bond. If arranged on a plane at an angle, you could create a 2d surface that switches between hydrophobic and hydrophilic states via phosphorylation. I imagined these little proteins to be in the shape of blocks, and they would be able to auto assemble into larger complexes by selectively locking each of their faces together like lego or a transformer. You'd only need to phosphorylate a junction once to lock it, and then again to unlock it. Over and over again. 

I guess amine/carboxyl groups already do this, minus the phosphorylation, but they don't auto-assemble in free space. And so far that's only one degree of motion. I also imagined building protein based optical tweezers for interacting with and grabbing onto dielectric molecules around the cell, which most polar molecules are. Single plasmon lasers can be built using complexes of only 10 or 20 atoms. If we could modify an amino acid to act as a single plasmon laser when phosphorylated, we would be able to produce an extremely efficient, directed light source that could have countless applications around the cell, and could be integrated into a protein by associating a codon to it. And again, this is expressed from an artificial organelle, so we'd have the luxury of being able to modify the codon language. From optical communication systems to microscopic spacial light modulators using chiral molecules abundant around the cell as the liquid crystal. A flexible lens made out of cholesterol or an even more simple chiral lipid would be able to change both the phase and focus of a microscopic light source. And while its difficult for us to make use of optical tweezers on the macroscopic scale, interacting with other molecules is ideal if you just want to identify single molecules or push/pull a neighboring proteins in a protein complex. And here's your second degree of motion. 

Also plasmons may sound like particle physics but they play a role in photosynthesis, especially for purple, sulfur based bacteria, which basically relies on sunlight and a plasmon cascade to produce an energy surplus from excitons when the cascade runs into the cell membrane. I read another paper demonstrating that this structure, the entire cell membrane, can become coherent and entangle with a quantum cavity. The largest structure to ever be entangled. And I think a lot about using these single plasmon lasers for quantum logic functions inside the cell, but given the ambient temperature of the cell, that's mostly speculative. 

Again, this isn't really formatted in the form of a question, but I would love to hear your thoughts on these or similar applications of using biology for the purposes of synthetic nano technology.",,3,,,,,Asrivak,1747647373.571059,climate science,scientific,t3_c04ksi,c04ksi

erazlwg,collapse,skeptical,,"This anti-capitalist theme pops up on collapse every few weeks which is fine but it seems to be latestagecapitalism threads and users cross-pollinating the idea that capitalism and only capitalism and no other -ism at all for any time period in history is to blame for the shitfuck storm humanity finds itself in now, today 2019. It's pretty much technicallythetruth but capitalism itself is just a small piece of the fuck pie.

Under communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarianism, kingdoms it's always been the same. The truth is societal collapse happens and will happen under any human -ism currently or previously devised, even animals and insects, once a population of an area, region or the globe exceeds that areas carrying capacity. It's a law of nature.

For humans, regional societies have grown and collapsed because they grew in numbers, destroyed their local environment and broke the carrying capacity.  For thousands of years this happened over and over with some growing bigger than others but all ending with collapses. Forest cutting for building, farming, food and energy helped increase the population and their use of more resources which accelerated collapse. Thru that time societies would intersect and war over territory and resources but under previous energy regimes, the environment and their use of energy didn't really result in any global system-wide effects. 

It wasn't until around 1900 and the discovery of oil / fossil fuels instead of human, wood, steam or electrical power that things kicked into high gear with the US, Britain and most first world nations adopting oil as a cheap source of energy. 1900 is used as the baseline for climate models because of the start of the mass adoption of fossil fuels. It's clear as day on the chart. That's when it started. 

It was just that fossil fuel use for the last 120 years by everyone on the planet since, including third-world nations, juiced the ability for all of humanity to overshoot the unbeknownst-at-the-time imaginary parity graph that showed fossil fuel use and population against Earth climate change factors.

From the billion or so people in 1900 to today's 7.7 billion people all were and are consumers. We eat and breathe and build and have gotten ourselves to the point where the rate that all the people in all societies consume, plus medicine that extended lifespans, advances in technology and global transportation that allowed us to do it faster to where the global carrying capacity overshot with no more areas for us to expand.

But not only did all- isms accelerate the planet's carrying capacity breakdown we also toxified it and now wrecked the climate to the point where it won't be able to support this many people all using fossil fuels for much longer. I don't know when but even if that fossil fuel stopped today, humans have already spewed enough emissions into the atmosphere since 1900 that the resulting effects that we see and will continue to see are already locked in. Ice melts affecting the climate,  sea levels and now the carrying capacity of the entire Earth not just one region but with 8 times the number of people from when we started 120 years ago.

Malthus was right he was just operating at a much smaller scale. But he did imagine populations in the billions just using his time's metric of the carrying capacity per acre per person. Fossil fuels blew up that relationship up too.

Population isn't decreasing, its increasing exponentially and humans are just destructive no matter what ism they live under.  They are destroying and have destroyed the planet so this can't be stopped until the planet's ability to sustain human life is greatly diminished which could reduce population drastically until it is somehow able to level off, but with a much wilder and inhospitable climate.

A fully agrarian society couldn't function with this many people without a non-emissions energy regime but it'll still end the same.
The 'it's all capitalism's fault' never offers any new societal structures or solutions that won't run into the same problem at the scales of people and energy use we are talking about today or 100 years from now. Communism or socialism isn't the answer nor is capitalism. It's too late and we are debating over who made the mess.

Have some self defense stuff.  A weapon.  If it turns ugly for a while.  Martial arts for the most part is worthless on the street.  Fair fights or 1 on 1 isn't a given.  Better learn from a bouncer or a real course on street psychology.  Better yet, just be be basic at parkour.

I think you're misidentifying the underlying cause. Yes it is tempting to blame capitalism, especially if that is shorthand for human behavior; but there's no such thing as sustainable exploitation - not with so many people on the planet. It is all unsustainable, green-tinged or not, whether it is under the umbrella of capitalism or any other political system. What would be your alternative to capitalism? Tofu and lentils? Or do you think state control would help? What do you think of China's hybrid approach?

We're now in the Anthropocene, and post our industrial revolution we're part of a self-sustaining growth engine. We're inside that, we're part of it.  Everything from the food we ate today to the posts we made on Reddit. And even apparently free tech - Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than Ecuador [(source](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2151823-bitcoin-mining-uses-more-energy-than-ecuador-but-theres-a-fix/)).  Targeting the worst aspects of capitalism is fine - that might make people's lives better to do that, if you can; but most of the proposed fixes - including green energy - are still fixes that would add more growth. Carbon dioxide isn't our only problem; it's just one of them.

If you *would* like to find out more about why we are where we are, and why the growth engine may now be out of our control, there is a good analysis [here](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-weve-created-a-civilisation-hell-bent-on-destroying-itself-im-terrified-writes-earth-scientist-113055).

There is one other aspect of blaming capitalism that concerns me. That is that a mass movement might send us hell for leather into a worse situation where the state makes all the decisions.

Q
An argument to fight global warming more often than not is to preserve our planet and the diversity of it. While I agree that all the data points towards an ever hotter planet, the same data shows that its been hotter in the past. So I ask if you agree with my assessment that greenhouse gas emissions take up a little bit too much space in the debate.

I mean, it's not global warming that kills off the Rhino, burn vast amounts of rainforest to grow crops, put plastic in our oceans, drain the aral lake, completely devastate the ocean floor while overfishing...... List goes on. 

Unless you have an interest in the field you seldom if ever hear about the above, and while it may seem that they are local problems. They really aren't. 

I just think that while an ever hotter planet is a bad thing(or rather, the rate of which it changes) and should be a concern, there are other imminent threats that happens without anyone knowing because co2 emissions are easier to measure and gets all the attention. The rate of which we as a human race kills off habitat for, and animals themselves is just off the charts.

I'm also aware that humanity has basically gone ""over the cliff"", and we're now in between going over the edge and hitting the ground, leaving geo-engineering as the only viable way to avoid human extinction at this point.

Question 1: I know the spraying of sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere is commonly mentioned as an attainable way of deflecting solar radiation. However SO2 also breaks down ozone, which would make it unsuitable for sustained use. Are there any other compounds currently being considered? Compounds that could remain in the stratosphere for some time, and accomplish the same as SO2 or better?

Question 2: Are you aware of any serious (= large budget) programs currently concerned with artificial CO2 sequestration?

This march doesn't appear to have a purpose outside of virtue signaling about science being great. It doesn't even specifically reference what funding is being cut in the part about defunding or what you recommend funding in it's place.

I'm a scientist who disagrees with the marchforscience because my experience in reality doesn't align with what you appear to be putting forward. It is not anti-intellectualism or lack of diversity that is wingclipping the scientists of the future, it's the dynamics of global economics. The fact that that is unaddressed alienates me as a scientist from your cause.

Here is why I would not suggest someone become a Chemist as I did (In ultra summary form). Even if someone was passionate about Chemistry I would tell them to think long and hard about joining my field. With respect to pharmaceuticals. Large companies are outsourcing large amounts of their workforces or recruiting largely low wage foreign nationals, driving the payscale of incoming entry level scientists through the floor. massive prohibitive costs by regulatory agencies make production of in human therapeutics insanely expensive. This has driven the industry more towards sourcing their projects by buying out (often foreign based) CROs or simply contracting the development milestones to the CROs leading to downsizing or elimination of domestic R&D. Doing specialist contract labor or flipping companies isn't an entry level market so there is often no place for entry level employees in this new ecosystem. Due to a mixture of economic recession and decreased federal spending the idea of getting a PhD and then entering tenure track academic careers is becoming less and less viable. These days if you get a degree you're looking at having spent 8+ years in school (ignoring post doc work if you do that) to fight tooth and nail over relatively low paying jobs with no chance at advancement not only against other domestic grads, but foreign grads and against an enormous force of experienced workers who are now re-entering the workforce.

So when I see the bleak future of myself and my fellow scientists early in their career and I see awful job/career prospects due to regulation/outsourcing/globalization/economics and you march on washington with non-concrete handwavey goals about diversity and outreach it makes me want to distance myself from your movement.",,109,,,,,doctorcrass,1747619970.120817,climate science,scientific,t3_62kss7,62kss7
dfni8cl,science,scientific,,"Thanks for organizing the march and for doing this AMA!

I am currently planning on attending, but it is clear to me (from Facebook, Twitter, and my own lab) that people have growing concerns about the way the march is heading. Specifically, the march seems to have gotten a bit off-topic by incorporating LGBTQ issues, as well as some pseudoscience groups, into its core mission. While I am extremely liberal and an active supporter of LGBTQ and similar movements (not the pseudoscience, though), many scientists simply aren't interested in marching for those things. Thus, incorporating ""protest culture"" into the march has taken away from the core message of the group, politicizing and polarizing what should be a non-partisan issue. 

My questions

- How do you plan to keep the march on topic? Lots of people are mad at the moves this administration is making, and for lots of reasons. Is the point just to raise numbers and get everyone involved to show how mad we are about the entire direction of the whole country, or to effect specific policy changes that we want as a field/pursuit/industry? 

- Do you not alienate, say, Evangelical Christian or Muslim scientists from your march by claiming that the social liberal agenda is a ""scientific issue""? What about public perception among social conservatives who support science, biomedical research, or biotechnology? 

- I know you aren't the ""thought police"" but how do you intend to prevent pseudoscience groups (like anti-vaxxers) from using this march as a platform to legitimize their movements?",,86,,,,,subito_lucres,1747619970.1235468,climate science,scientific,t3_62kss7,62kss7
dfnjyk5,science,scientific,,"I'm not crazy about the march. Here's my main two reasons why.

(1) The public doesn't perceive that scientists are not passionate or caring. The public perceives that scientists don't work on issues relevant to everyday concerns and don't come to a single concrete consensus the way other professional classes do. A march isn't going to help explain why, for example, working on the development of a fly eye is relevant to understanding cancer in humans. (It is! Ask a molecular biologist why!) Or why having 98% of scientists agree on man-made climate change IS a consensus. That level of dissent is ridiculously low for matters scientific.

(2) The numbers are going to be poor relative to other marches. The visuals of fewer people than the inaguration or women's march, for example, will not do the scientific community any favors among those who are sore about the perceived ""slight"" by the media about reports of low inaguration numbers. 

There are a lot of things we can do to promote science in this country. Walking through the streets of DC chanting ""Hey Hey Ho Ho NIH cuts have got to go"" is not one of them. 

Activism is good, but a march, not so much.

I'm happy to hear the organizers' thoughts on this.

dfnb34l,science,scientific,,"Hi everyone, and thank you for doing this AMA. I think the March for Science is a great idea, and I am looking forward to marching myself in DC later next month.

I have a couple of questions for you. First, you say:

> The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.

This is something that I think sounds great in principle, but is a bit hard to define when you get closer to the problem. For example, what is the criteria for determining whether a national science program is being 'robustly funded' (a percentage of GDP?) or what do you mean by science that is 'publicly communicated' (is this a critique of paywalled journals?).


My second question relates to a talking point that I have seen floating around your social media - the idea that the March is a non-partisan, but political event. I get the concept, and I understand why a nonprofit organization has to be non-partisan, but let's be real: in the U.S. the major threat to science and scientific policy comes from Republicans and in particular the Republican in the White House. I say this because, I have seen the idea that ""both sides have anti-science views"" gain traction. That seems like a huge false equivalency to me. No major policy position by the Democratic party comes anywhere near the level of some of the anti-science policies GOPers in the US are clamoring to enact. So I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that, and I wish I would hear a lot less of the ""both sides are bad"" nonsense from the MfS.

This type of trend dynamics is common to other things like fashion, music styles and so on. I would argue, admittedly without any hard evidence, that we've reached ""peak science"", and perhaps we are enduring the backlash.

Now, conjectures apart, I don't think you can teach science, same way you can't teach religion. Attempting to do so is very superficial, and all you're left with are dogmas. In a way, without sufficient understanding, people will accept science the same they accept any other ideas: that is to say, blindly. On the other hand, you'll have people rejecting science for similar reasons. More important than teaching ""science"", is probably teaching philosophy and give person rational tools to make up their own minds. If not philosophy, at least a strong critical sense, which is maybe what science boils down to. I'd argue this is the best way to avoid those dogmas, and the main difference between a religious and a scientific view of reality.

I realized I don't really have a question, but these two: 

1. what exactly is the message you are trying to get across?

2. what is your plan to do it and minimize the backlash, and without sounding ""pedantic"" or ""passé"", bearing in mind that that message will be filtered by the media?

I have a few comments and questions, but first a little about my own background. I'm a professional scientist (PhD in Physics) who works at one of our national laboratories. Many of our national labs, including where I work, are more conservative than liberal due to the nature of the work we perform. On the political spectrum, I normally fall somewhere in the middle (social liberal/fiscal conservative with many nuances), trying to rely on being accurately informed prior to forming opinions, and openly willing to change my mind.

Because the march for science is a reaction to the suppression of scientific information by the current crop of politicians, and an attack on the scientific method more generally, I feel this is a crucial movement. 

I am concerned that this movement will devolve into an anti-Trump/anti-Republican agenda, allowing conservatives to easily dismiss the crucial advancements science provides for everyone (not only the general public, but also war fighters and national security, which are near and dear to the conservative ideal), by simply claiming the movement as a liberal agenda. Scientists know this is false, but scientists do not communicate well with the general public.

1. What ideas does the movement have to address the misunderstanding by the general public of the process and importance of science for the months and years after the march? 

I see this disconnect as more systemic than simply the administration/congress de jour. For example, the space race did wonders to cement the relationship between science and a positive popular opinion. 

2. What is the plan to help break free from a political label?  

This is of course complicated and nuanced. The reason for the protest is directly linked to the anti-science agenda that republicans have been pursuing for decades, but liberals are not immune to such stupidity. **I'm looking at you anti-vaxers**. One suggestion would be to encourage participants to RESPECTFULLY carry the American flag. I realize this is not something scientists are particularly comfortable with, and many scientists are not American by birth or identity. However, our protest is that the American government is not acting the way we think the American government should and the consequences are dangerous. We have to stand up and say ""Americans will not stand for our government behaving this way,"" and should therefore carry the flag as a symbol. In addition, popular opinion is swayed by images and video. Having a prominent American symbol associated with the movement will help persuade people, and make it difficult to be labeled as simply a liberal movement. In other words, the movement cannot come across as unAmerican.

I'm a first year graduate student in meteorology, therefore I am a TA and have the pleasure of grading for the intro level classes.

When I'm grading, how can I effectively portray to students that it is indeed a real and serious thing? In the same vein (yet a different class), the professor is going to start talking about climate change. These kids are freshmen and have a very elementary understanding of weather and climate. What's an effective way to teach them and to get them to think critically about the subject? 

Next week my school is putting on a student showcase so that we can present our research. Within this there is going to be a round table discussion about climate change and how we as scientists communicate it. Here are a few of the sample questions that we will be discussing : 
-Do we need to change the way scientists are educated (e.g., broaden, add more ""soft skills"" or social science)?

df9hdmm,science,scientific,,"What % of all the greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide? Isn't it less than 1%? If I remember correctly water vapor H2O is by far the largest greenhouse gas and accounts for about 60-80% of the greenhouse effect. 

As a global warming skeptic, please explain how carbon dioxide can be responsible for planet wide increase in the greenhouse effect (warming) when CO2 is only a fraction (<1%) of the greenhouse effect. 

I don't think anyone denies the fact that CO2 levels are rising, I just completely doubt the idea that this one tiny greenhouse gas could actually affect the weather on this planet. I think a more reasonable explanation is increased solar activity is increasing the amount of water vapor (THE LARGEST GREENHOUSE GAS) in the atmosphere which in turn is warming the planet. 

Do global warming extremist ever feel bad that CO2 is plant food, and by trying to reduce CO2 they are actually reducing plant life on the planet? I believe plant life was at its greatest when volcanic activity on the planet was higher and spewing tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, which provided for the huge plant life which created more oxygen as a byproduct, allowing for larger animal life. 

I will admit though, that even as a skeptic, the amount of filthy pollution in the air in places like China IS a problem, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's warming the planet.

In the article you published, can you please comment on why specifically these analogies were chosen to be tested? Are they normally used to explain climate change to people?
Do you have any indications or assumptions as to why the medical analogy works better than the other two?
Can the ""climate sceptics"" introduce bias by presenting the analogies weaker in influence, not because they are not clear, but because they come with their own prejudice?

As far as I can see this study concentrated more on analogies convincing people that action is needed in spite of lack of absolute certainty in prediction of climate change consequences. Are there studies oriented on the use of analogies in explanation of the process and mechanisms of climate change, and specifically in dispelling the misinformation and falsehood about climate and human influence on climate change?

Growing up, I remember that a big environmental concern was human activity causing ozone depletion in our atmosphere, leading to the so-called 'ozone hole'. It was quite the concern, if I remember correctly. Luckily, strong environmental policy and research advocacy led to the enactment of legislation restricting the use of the chemicals that were causing ozone depletion. And, recent news studies suggest that this approach worked - the ozone layer appears to be 'healing'.

SO my question is, to what extent is this possible for climate change? If humans got serious about reducing CO2 emissions, would we see a similar 'healing' of the climate?",,62,,,,,SirT6,1747618904.6711428,climate science,scientific,t3_5rtksv,5rtksv

However I hear arguments that free-range farming may not be as environmentally friendly as it may appear.

Is free-range farming beneficial to natural ecosystems and the global environment in the face of both growing populations and growing popularity in free-range produce? Or is the land required for free-range farming more detrimental in terms of habitat destruction than factory farming?

1. What percentage of your research is funded by government grants? Do you feel that you would have an equal chance of getting government funding to conduct research that had a hypothesis skeptical of climate change? 

2. How would you respond to people who argue that the margin of error in most recent NOAA publications is greater than the change in temperature from the past several years? Do you think it is appropriate to claim a year is the ""hottest year on record"" when the margin of error is greater than the temperature delta? 

3. How do you feel about the recent accusations that NOAA was changing temperature data to support their findings on climate change. How does this impact your assertion that scientists are generally ""honest""? Do you think funding has the potential to skew results?

4. Along the same lines, how do you respond to recent research that questions the possibility of attaining certainty in complex scientific disciplines as it ""...often doesn't eliminate uncertainties to the extent we might expect...due to a tendency to under-estimate the chance of significant abnormalities in results"" - David Bailey U of T professor department of physics. phys.org/news/2017-02-certainty-complex-scientific-unachievable-goal.html  Do you think there is any risk in touting the current state of climate science as unequivocal fact? Does it discourage an attitude of research and questioning which could ultimately lead to more knowledge? 

5. How do you respond to those that question the often quoted ""97% of climate scientists..."" stating that the study's findings were, in fact, that 97% of scientists who expressed an opinion on climate change were in support of man-made climate change? In other words, it didn't include those that published a paper that offered an inconclusive stance on human caused climate change.

I'm a career firefighter in central New Jersey in our area we've seen a huge spike in solar panels which makes me extremely proud to be moving away from fossil fuels but it also creates a huge number of challenges for us. Through the research I've done it is nearly impossible to turn off solar panels themselves which hinders a huge part of our firefighting efforts, that being ventilation. We ventilate to release the smoke and heat from a structure increasing visibility for us and also increasing survivability to any victims. Breaking windows is a viable source of ventilation but that comes with its flaws as it isn't nearly as effective as being able to cut a hole one the roof and control where we want the smoke heat and fire to travel, as well as create a larger area to release these element rapidly. With the introduction of solar panels and new technologies I've seen such as solar panel shingles and windows, we become very limited in our abilities to extinguish the fire and protect the residents. We are able to disconnect the current from the panels to the house limiting our chances of electrocution but the panels themselves have been proven to conduct enough electricity through our hose streams to potentially kills us. I would like to see any information and more studies conducted alongside firefighters to get our input and educate us on how to handle solar panels more effectively or build them so they can be quickly shut down or removed  to aid us in our efforts.  With the construction trends of the past few decades, wooden trusses, wooden I beams, and now solar panels. We have less and less time to conduct interior attacks and searching for victims before the structure begins to collapse(I.e. 5 minutes in a truss constructed home) now with the added weight of panels, I fear we will be getting away from stopping homes from burning to the ground and not being able to search for victims. Again I would like to see more studies on how these technologies perform under fire conditions, what time frames do we have for collapse with the added weight on truss constructed roofs, can we devise a way to eliminate electrocution hazards from the panels, and can we design plans for quick removal of panels so we can remove them rapidly and work around them.",,2,,,,,BiggerBuckDown,1747619133.298101,climate science,scientific,t3_5vieqm,5vieqm

Possibly this film is just pliable enough to be used over a traditional backpack and feeds a battery placed inside of a pocket in the backpack.

My first question is with regard to aerosols. The leveling off in global surface air temperatures between the 40s and 70s, and the subsequent rapid acceleration, is often attributed to industrially sourced aerosol pollution and then the clean air act respectively. We are now seeing China rapidly clean up it's act and reduce pollution levels. Might we see a substantial acceleration in global temperatures rise over the next few decades as a result?

On science communication, there has probably never been as big a battle between the scientific reality and corporate interests as we see now over climate change, with many myths and anti-climate change/science propaganda so pervasive within the public debate.

ctizjks,science,scientific,,"I have heard before that the net effect of increased water in the atmosphere is the biggest source of uncertainty in climate models, but this is the first time I've heard that it's the relationship between clouds and aerosols. I attributed it to how much water will remain as invisible vapor versus how much will form into clouds since the former is a purely positive forcing while clouds contribute to albedo. 

Can you give us some idea of the contribution to the uncertainty of these two (amount of cloud formation versus interaction of clouds with aerosols)? I'm sure these two sources of uncertainty are related, ie because cloud seeding may reduce cloud cover, but they seem distinct enough to be separated out. I'm okay with answers in W/m^2 but degrees C by some year would obviously be more widely accessible.

What's the latest, greatest research on global albedo changes? Has net albedo changed on a global level? 

Are you optimistic about the Paris climate talks? Shouldn't we be talking about carbon budgets rather than percent cuts from/by whatever years? Regardless of what that budget might be, how do you think the remaining carbon budget should be divided? Should historical emissions play a role? Should we just divide the remainder in a per capita way?

* How did you choose your reviewers? They seem to be a collection of bloggers, activists and other vested interests. Not scientists at all. 

* With respect to the timestamp data you sought to withhold, what comment do you make on the observation that it shows that you collected data, analyzed it, decided to recollect, analyzed again, then decided to change the data classification rules and have another shot at collecting the data once more? Were your results not what you wanted so you started over with shifted goalposts?

* Do you honestly believe that science should just be done by consensus ??


With regard to your Inoculation Theory article:

* Wikipedia says of inoculation theory ""This will hopefully make the receiver actively defensive and allow them to create arguments in favor of their preexisting thoughts"". Is that not just closing minds? Shouldn't people be encouraged to think freely instead of being given preexisting thoughts, and taught to harden against changing their minds?

We have no experimental or theoretical reason to believe however that these models work with grid sizes in the miles.  These models have shown themselves to be either incorrect or are only correct by virtue of predicting such a wide range of possible answers as to make their predictions unverifiable in the short or medium term.  While these models are the best tool at our disposal would you agree that we lack any way to truly test them at present?

2) Would you agree that while to the average person the argument ""everyone thinks this so you should think it as well"" is a useful rule of thumb, however it is not scientifically relevant what the majority of scientists think.  Would you agree that arguments such as this amount to calls to authority and that scientists who we now consider heroes were themselves almost universally fighting against the calls to authority of their age (which was usually religious).  Do you find it problematic that science today is adopting the same arguments which for hundreds of years were used to put down the world's most significant scientists?

3) Would you agree that typically if science made claims about a system as immensely complex as global climate, made claims that massive action needed to be taken because of extremely long term consequences which were difficult to model, In the ordinary course it would take several decades to test and re-test the models before we would believe such sweeping claims were scientifically valid?

* We'll probably reach 2-3 degrees this century.
* The climate in North Dakota will look more like the southwest US, which would make the Southwest pretty much unlivable.
* the horrible drought that we had in America a couple years ago (where a large percentage of the crops died) will be an average year during the second half of this century
* the permafrost will start to melt, and that could double the amount of greenhouse gases
* the glaciers and the poles are melting faster than previously thought
* it will keep getting worse every year until we get down to zero carbon emmissions

(That’s about 1,200 square miles of solar cells a year, times 25 equals 30,000 square miles of photovoltaic cells.) Two terawatts of solar thermal? If it’s 30 percent efficient all told, we’ll need 50 square meters of highly reflective mirrors every second. (Some 600 square miles a year, times 25.) Half a terawatt of biofuels? Something like one Olympic swimming pools of genetically engineered algae, installed every second. (About 15,250 square miles a year, times 25.) Two terawatts of wind? That’s a 300-foot-diameter wind turbine every 5 minutes. (Install 105,000 turbines a year in good wind locations, times 25.) Two terawatts of geothermal? Build 3 100-megawatt steam turbines every day-1,095 a year, times 25. Three terawatts of new nuclear? That’s a 3-reactor, 3-gigawatt plant every week-52 a year, times 25.”

My question is about anti science beliefs more generally; do you think the psychology behind climate science denial can also explain other types of science denial?

My colleagues all work in extraordinary wide variety of positions, and come from a diverse set of backgrounds. There is certainly no linear path to sustainability careers, but that also means there is no ""right or wrong"" way. 

My advice, pure ""sustainability"" jobs don't often exist. I'd recommend:

1) exploring what aspect of sustainability excites you the most? Climate Change? Water use? Gender equality? Ending poverty? Circular economy? Use the sustainable development goals as a guide. 


2) then explore what kind of industry excites you. Retail? Energy? Forestry? Transportation? 

After you have your answer to #1 and #2 try and start getting experience in that realm!

I picked climate change and the energy industry, and have found great success. When I worked in a corporate team, none of my co-workers had similar backgrounds. Engineers, computer science, geophysics, biologists, poli sci, communications. etc...while all different backgrounds, they brought unique experiences for certain sustainability-related issues that was useful. I was actually the only one with a sustainablility-specifc education in the 25 person team.

I'd look at CU boulder cause there's tons of groups in town doing that kind of work and you can hustle for a job after, for instance NCAR employes a bunch of computer engineers and would be a great place to work. otherwise Princeton and U Wash maybe?

> Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, is tired of the entire discussion, which he says comes down to definitions and academic bickering. There is no evidence for a change in the long-term warming trend, he says, and there are always a host of reasons why a short-term trend might diverge — and why the climate models might not capture that divergence.

> “A little bit of turf-protecting and self-promotion I think is the most parsimonious explanation,” Schmidt says. “Not that there's anything wrong with that.”

You'll find that most of these 'exorbitant bitcoin energy usage' claims usually aren't too genuine in how they present or measure the data. Then, of course it's never compared to the entire world's financial system for example, only compared to 'credit cards'. 

Think of, for instance, the hundreds of thousands of Loomis transport trucks shuffling money to and fro, everyday. Gas usage, oil usage, tire usage, etc. Think of the amount of energy it takes to make paper money (from planting crops, to harvesting, ink and other resource procurement, etc.), only to destroy it at the end of it's life. Think of the energy usage of all the financial centers, and server farms keeping that data nice and air conditioned. There's even people guarding money, and the server farms as well. This top-level comment details how a well-reputed crypto news site did a pretty in-depth review of the energy usage/wastage of the legacy system.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/c0t5xc/bitcoin_creates_as_much_co2_as_the_city_of_las/er7gpwp

So, we have to admit that our legacy system itself uses an extreme amount of energy. 

Bitcoin on the other hand (mining), is more profitable with the more energy you throw at it. For that very reason, a very large amount of miners are set up near renewable energy sources, where energy is abundant and cheap. Wouldn't you want the best return on your investment?

First of all, bitcoin and other cryptos are experimental technologies. Most experimental technologies are inefficient. I mean, nobody complains about how much energy the Large Hadron Collider wastes.

Second, bitcoin has already proven that it can successfully go through coin splits, so this kills the whole ""path dependency"" argument.

If bitcoin were ever to scale, it's unlikely that it would remain in its current form, IF the market desires a greener cryptocurrency. The market would select a bitcoin branch that breaks the current consensus and has a more efficient proof-of-work amount, ie. *just* enough proof-of-work to prevent double spending attacks, but no more. Or it would select a branch that replaces POW with POS entirely.

Third, this article doesn't dive deeply into economics of bitcoin mining. It fails to discuss negative energy prices for example, which occur in places like Germany with a high share of intermittent renewable energy sources. Intermittent negative energy prices are likely to become more and more common as the world switches from fossils to wind and solar. The world is going to *need* a place where it can dump large amounts of unwanted electricity during certain periods. Bitcoin miners are a perfect match. At some point it will become unprofitable to mine with anything other than negatively priced electricity.

A very significant portion of mining comes from the Chinese highlands.

First, how many models did you look at to determine the amount of projected warming without human interaction? We are still below maximum sea level before the last ice age, so would we expect an equal amount of sea level rise eventually in addition to the damage done anthropogenically? 

Also, a couple of the early figures in the summary refer to changes in earth temperature being iirc 1.8° F on average. Is that at the surface? Is that measured and interpolated across the surface or based on remote sensing methods?


This was by far the most thorough research ive seen. I skimmed through the references for a couple chapters of the report and the sheer volume of references is staggering. How long did your literature review process take?

Sarah here to try and answer these collectively.... 
As climate scientists we don’t have the expertise needed to say what the best solutions are, either form a policy standpoint or a legal standpoint. Climate scientists can calculate what the climate impact will be of various policy solutions, but a lot more than that needs to be considered in deciding what’s the best policy solution. For sure we think the best current knowledge about climate change should inform these conversations. But in addition to this, experts are needed to determine the technical feasibility of different solutions, the risks associated with those solutions (vs continuing to burn fossil fuels), the economic and societal impacts (good and bad!) of different possible solutions… The final answers will also likely be based on what we as a society value and what risks we’re willing to take.

**The Hypothesis-** As a function of the nose is to ""condition"" the air (clean, regulate temperature and dehumidify) we breath in, these authors thought nose evolution was perhaps forced by climatic factors.

**The Findings-** 1) Nose shape is more differentiated across different countries' populations than expected under genetic drift alone. 2) The width of the nostrils are correlated with temperature and absolute humidity (quantitative measure of water vapor in the air), but not with relative humidity (percentage water vapor content). 3) Other factors, such as sexual selection, are likely also a factor.",,114,,,,,HerbziKal,1747621793.337684,climate science,scientific,t3_68zver,68zver

I have had breathing issues for the biggest part of my life because my bone structure in my nose is really tight and it causes all kinds of issues. My mother had it and so did her sisters and mother, they all had surgery for it. I know quite a lot of people with similar issues where the slime can't flow out properly etc.

My question is however: is this just something that is evolved in a cruel way or does it serve a practical purpose? Or a bit of both?

Could this selection on the nose just be an example of the [green beard effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-beard_effect)?  Basically, the nose is literally a central physical marker of genetic (and social) compatibility.  

I guess you could further investigate the climate adaptation hypothesis by looking at Native American populations.

In my eyes renewable energy sources are not efficient enough to carry the energy demands of a big country. Especially those that do not benefit from solar or hydroelectric power have to rely on fossil fuels for electricity.

Nuclear power has its known risks but it can cut emissions for a low price. I think opting to combat climate change and opting against nuclear power are a combination that dont go well. I had Germany in mind when typing this. All the negatives of nuclear due to its neighbours, increased electricity prices, and increased reliance on coal.

dgdi946,science,scientific,,"* Thanks for doing an AMA. As much as I understand that climate change by human activity is very real, I have always wondered if it made any sense to unilaterally act to reduce our carbon foot print. Even if the relatively richer west magically cuts out carbon emissions totally, which is impossible, the rest of the world (and thats a vast majority of human activity!) isn't going to do so. This is as much a political issue as it is a scientific one. If governments elsewhere can't even get a gripe on wars, crimes, corruption., etc.. there is no way they will start listening to the rich west telling them to slow down on development and be clean, even if they did believe in the legitimacy of the science, which itself has become debate in the west.


* I have always argued that rather than fund climate change policies, it would do a whole lot more good to simply fund education (reduce human stupid) and new technologies that out strip carbon reliance (this we have some, but not quite there yet). So that the developing nations actually want to adopt new methods of energy production. It is still economics in the end.


* I compare this situation to cancer research; I once attended a seminar where a speaker controversially declared that had all the billions in cancer research been instead channeled into eradicating cigarettes (taking down the big and powerful lobby of tobacco companies) and bad modern diets (as well as crap food lobbies), it would have prevented a whole lot more cancers than any of the new treatments and drugs combined.

Both of the mammoth genomes were sequenced on Illumina machines at what most would (subjectively) call only medium-low coverage for a diploid (11x and 17x).

Firstly, how similar could these be to historical mammoth? Is the limit theoretical or 'only' technical? 

Do you think that if we were confident that this would be effective in reducing further global warming it would be a good idea? 

The reasoning wasn't so clear in the article, but from what I could tell, mammoth would eat away at the treeline which would result in more grassland, which reflects more sunlight than forest, which would reduce permafrost melting.

I’m Sarah Richardson.  I specialize in the design of genomes and the creation of all the technological tools necessary to be able to write this sentence with a straight face. I work on massive scale synthetic biology projects (Sc2.0), the construction of genetic toolkits for non-model organisms (CRISPR for GMOs), and the reconciliation of computational genomics with experimental genomics (bioinformatics is not IT). All of which is to say, I am a germ wrangler who uses DNA to train microbes to do tricks.

I’m Hansi Singh. I will soon be joining the Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) as a Linus Pauling Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow.  I research climate variability and change, with a focus on the polar regions.  One intriguing open question is why Arctic and Antarctic climates are responding so differently to anthropogenic forcing by greenhouse gases.  The tools I use run the gamut from global climate models run on supercomputers, to small heuristic models that can be analyzed with pencil and paper.  I am also interested in developing novel mathematical analysis methods for improved understanding of coupling in the climate system and global teleconnections.  For more information on my research interests and publications, please visit www.atmos.washington.edu/~hansi

I’m Aurora Pribram-Jones, and I tinker with electronic structure theory.  I build mathematical tools to investigate how well we describe electrons in metals and molecules. My interests lie in analyzing and developing density functional theory (DFT), one of the most popular computational methods in the world, and how it’s used for thermal ensembles.  Day to day, this means I get to interact with shock physicists, planetary modelers, and fusion scientists while imagining pseudo-molecules and drawing pictures.  My newest projects look at applications of DFT methods in other complicated systems: materials for hydrogen storage, high entropy alloys, and materials responding to lasers.

Internet service was down for the last four days so I was doing some reading, “Mapping the Mind” by Rita Carter. I found this passage on p.42 to be in agreement with our conclusions: 

>“Our urge to rationalize behavior probably has considerable survival value. The human species got where it is largely by forming complex social constructs – from the hunting party to the political party – and making them work. To work they require that we have confidence in them and to have confidence we need to believe that the actions of these organizations are based on sound, rational judgements. At one level, of course, we know we are kidding ourselves. For example, all governments, in all societies, have some policies that are demonstrably irrational. However, no government member, anywhere, ever admits this – not at the time, anyway. Instead they rationalize their policy-making. We may see through it, but basically we like things this way – it makes us feel safe.”

So basically what we have is a subconsciously directed Homo erectus fossil fuel hunting party with the added capabilities of technology, without willfulness, with a wordsmithing module that tells us we’re doing the right thing and that God loves capitalism, F-150 trucks, war heroes, Coca-Cola, that humans are special, growth is good and that the technological singularity is just beyond the horizon.

dicnzsy,science,scientific,,"I think the big issues with the Paris Agreements have less to do with science and more to do with funding and politics.

Man made climate change exists. Anyone with an iota of critical reasoning should be able to look at the myriad of peer reviewed papers and interviews with credentialed experts on the subject, and logically come to the conclusion that this is an enormous problem that can only be tackled effectively on a global scale.

HOWEVER... the Paris Agreements are:

A) ineffective (allowing countries to tailor reduction goals in any way they seem fit)

B) toothless (no punishments for missing targets; ""peer pressure"" is how some of the developed world expects to ensure emerging markets keep their end of the bargain)

C) expensive ($100 billion a year minimum, from wealthy developed nations to emerging economies, in order to offset the cost of using more expensive ""green"" technology)

**NOTE: Depending on which article you read, the $100 billion dollar figure is either a yearly total paid by all the big developed countries... or the figure to be contributed yearly just by us in the USA. To date, we have pledged around 30% of the total funds for the United Nations Green Climate Fund ($3 billion from us, $7 billion from 42 other countries, for a little over $10 billion total). So I think it's fair to say that the amount would've been between $30 and $100 billion yearly from the US to other countries**

That's a lot of money to give away to other nations with no guarantees that they will follow through on their end, especially since the recipients include our economic competitors such as China and India. For comparison's sake, $30 billion is the amount America spends yearly on humanitarian aid throughout the world. This money could definitely yield better short term results if pumped into similar programs (clean water/combating AIDS or other diseases/lessening poverty), whether domestic or abroad. 

On the other hand, the US spends almost $4 trillion dollars a year; this is a small percentage to pay for us to combat such a large scale problem... especially when we know we'll be seeing multi-trillion dollar economic reductions once it starts to get real bad in the 2080's and the 2090's. 

Personally, I think the Paris Agreement was nothing more than political grandstanding, a proverbial pat on the back for all the world leaders. ""We did something about climate change, yay!"" I understand that it's hard to get almost 200 countries to agree on something, but the current language is so weak that it is practically useless. As Americans, what we need to do is push our elected officials to come up with a legitimate and detailed plan that actually spells out the monetary costs associated and the targets that must be met. It really doesn't have to be so expansive in number of countries - if we could get China, India, Pakistan, and the EU on board, we'd have the majority of the world's greenhouse gas emitters right there with us. Then we could use ""peer pressure"" to convince the smaller ones left. It is a much more rational and substantive way forward. 

Now, is the current administration going to lead the way forward with this? Almost certainly not. But that's a topic for another day.

Firstly don't cite 98% of scientists agree, firstly this isn't necessarily climate scientists and consensus of opinion is not part of the scientific process, consensus in observation is and you should focus on that point.

I am a conservative. I believe in climate change. I believe it is mostly caused by man and has the potential to be catastrophic. However, I don't see anyone from the left or right taking an honest approach to solve this problem. 

The first main thing that no one talks about is nuclear. It supplies 20% of US energy right now. After all the government programs and huge pushes from organizations, where are renewables? 15%? Now, the first problem is that we aren't expanding nuclear. I have found no legitimate reason why nuclear shouldn't be pursued as a reasonable answer to fight climate change. Unsafe? False. Run out of uranium? False. The main argument I keep hearing is the same crap one I heard from Bill Nye on his new show - people dont want it. Well guess what, make people want it. We've spent so much forcing premature green energy into the market, I think we can afford a little education on an existing solution to this nightmare. 

Another part of this that no one wants to address is that if we don't persue nuclear, it doesn't just stay there. We've stopped making plants, and all existing ones are getting old, which means that 20% will be rapidly declining to 0 in the next 10-20 years. And what will fill that strong base load? Sorry to say it will definitely not be green. So.trying our best to push green energy, there will be a net loss as long we keep this up. 

Lastly, if we do want to make green energy work, prematurely forcing it into the market is costing us billions. Billions that should be spent on R&D. When it becomes economically viable and competitive, then go to market. And it will thrive.

Overall, I am happy with Trump's decision to pull out of this agreement.

FOOD:

* **eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products (none is the best)**
* eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated, and produces plastic waste so drink tap water)
* eat proper portion sizes
* remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment so adopt don’t shop to discourage their production, and choose pets that are herbivores

ENERGY:

* **drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible, avoid flying**
* use efficient lightbulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room
* Unplug devices when not in use (to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet, some are very cheap)
* insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary
* criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much
* forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing. (that way more people get to live on less land, sharing walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.)
* buy solar panels
* don't be afraid of nuclear power plants

WASTE

* avoid items with too much packaging
* don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging)
* buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
* recycle
* avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery and cups e.g. bring reusable tumbler to Starbucks, disposable wipes, disposable plastic bags, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.)
* contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging

WATER:

* don't flush the toilet when not necessary
* don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids, and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...)
* turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc.
* cut down on showers and baths
* don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering 

ACTIVISM:

* Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle (feel free to share this list)
* Donate money to environmental charities
* Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicians
* Look into buying carbon emission offset (this is the only point on this list that I haven't researched yet, so I'm not sure)

Also what evidence show high level of co2 is bad? Our crops and most green vegetation need this for life. Not to mention the ocean Benifits too. Is co2 helping the production of our food? These questions seem to be the ones that some climate scientist say that human contribution is not important.

I recently watched Cowspiracy, a documentary on how the world’s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about animal agriculture as being the primary reason for climate change (let alone numerous other problems) as encouraging more environmentally sustainable diets and apparently repels 'supporters' of these organizations. Instead of focusing on the fact that it takes ~660 gallons of water to make a hamburger, or ~4 gallons of water for a gallon of milk, these organizations encourage us that the transportation and domestic sectors are the primary reasons for climate change and other environmental ills. They tell us to fix leaky faucets and to do other small tasks as people do not like larger commitments.

> I also lead an interdisciplinary centre looking at climate solutions, and I would welcome a discussion of ideas on possible solutions. Does solar geoengineering or large-scale carbon capture and storage have legs? Where should we concentrate research effort? Any whacky ideas we should look into?

I think that its likely changing the climate maybe an _easier_ challenge that changing human nature, at least in the short term, and therefore one of the most promising routes out of the climate challenges we are facing is a capitalistic one. If something is good (or less bad) for the planet _and_ makes financial sense it generally seems to appeal to those on both sides of the political spectrum. 

With this is mind, are they any avenues which you feel have potential to re-work markets while favouring the environment?

Two areas I am interested in are Carbon capture with manufacturing and hemp!

In the last year or two I have seen there are some recent developments in terms of cost effective carbon capture from the atmosphere, but also some talk about how carbon fibre [may be carcinogenic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11944536) and not ideal to use as a manufacturing material. I would be really interested if you have any thoughts or ideas on this subject? Sometimes people mention that the ideal carbon capture and manufacturing concept already exists in the tree, which is of course true, but not a solution to our problems as the capital yield at present for woodland is too small to be valued enough to keep around it seems. Carbon fibre seems like a magical material due to its strength, versatility, and recyclability. I cant help thinking of all the hard waste in landfill that could transition to being carbon based. 

Regarding hemp, there are not many developments in the last number of decades to ease production that I am aware of. The blocker for using hemp for clothing and paper (in an innumerably more ecologically friendly way than woodland) has been / is largely political. The tide seems to be turning at present and de-regulation of industrial (and other forms) of hemp in various nations. Have you performed (or are you aware of) any research of moving away from cotton and wood pulp and its effects on the environment? Any other thoughts on this area?

dikroa6,science,scientific,,"Dear Dr. Smith,

I read some of your paper and have some questions. One of the main variables you suggest is affecting the genetic structure of populations is the lineage extinction rate, where tropical species are undergoing less extinction than species at higher latitudes. 

But extinction rate is just a proxy for some other processes - like long-term climatic variability. So my first question is, what factors do we think contribute to extinction rate mechanistically?

Secondly, why would a group of species undergoing less extinction (tropical) compared to a group that is undergoing a lot of extinction (temperate) have more genetic diversity? I'm curious about how being around longer somehow increases your diversity.

And last question: as an aspiring developmental biologist, I really like looking at ""process"". The questions that drive me are mechanistic and process-oriented in nature. My phylogenetics friends have argued strongly in favor of looking at ""pattern"". What do you say?

dikx6ae,science,scientific,,"Hi Brian! Few questions for you from a fellow ecologist, apologies in advance I didn't have much time so if I misinterpreted anything please let me know:

1)  In figure 2 of your paper where you show the heatmap for the phylogeographic structure across all species, why do you think that there appears to be the greatest mean diversity well south of the equator/tropics?  Or am I interpreting this incorrectly?


2)  I notice that you say changes in climate since the Last Glacial Maximum were not significant in your model, but climate traits which are likely correlated to current latitude likely are.  But you later discuss that ""these environmental effects were particularly profound in northern latitudes, where large ice sheets covered much of the terrain"".  How can you reconcile these two things, do you think maybe the metric you used doesn't accurately capture the effects of glaciation on the temperate zones?

3)  I notice that lineage extinction rate is quite a significant difference, what do you think practically contributes to this metric?  Is it just a reflection of climate variability perhaps?

4)  How do you expect the strength of abiotic vs biotic forces separating the species to vary across this space?  would it be correct to say that we may be looking at abiotic forces playing a disproportionately larger role in the higher latitude than in the tropics?

5)  Have you thought of doing anything along the lines of QST vs FST comparisons to tease apart whether this variation you are seeing in phenotypic traits reflects local adaptation to a different latitude, or is just present because of neutral genetic processes like genetic drift?


Really enjoyed your paper! :) I notice your sample size for your Morphological data is 5 birds per trait, I'm a plant ecologist so unsure really when it comes to birds but is this a normal sample size or is it on the low side?

My question is about the impact of melting Arctic/Antarctic ice, and it's possible effect on oceanic currents like the Gulf Stream.

People seem to think that the only impact might be a slight rise in sea level, but it's my understanding that those big oceanic currents drive not just weather patterns but also the movement and health of sea life.

As you go over the various arguments pro and con AGW you'll find that AGW skeptics base their case on what we know rather than on what we speculate. AGW believers on the other hand base their case on the reverse. In order to create their case they've decided that (depending on the presenter and the question) natural climate cycles have not occured at all or that they were regional in nature. The latter case is even more problematic than the former given that the current AGW hypothesis insists that small changes ampify through feedbacks. How then do they justify believing that a local change in climate lasting hundreds of years can have no effect on the globe? AGW is built on contradictions and denial of previous observations. 

We know that throughout the period we can measure with some accuracy that global temperatures have cycled between warm and cool periods. A cool period ended at or about 1850 and so a warming period had to ensue regardless of whether there had been any industrial output by humans.

AMA!","Hi, I’m [Jeremy Martin](http://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/jeremy-martin.html), a researcher with the Union of Concerned Scientists. I have a PhD in chemistry, and, despite a former career in computer chip development and manufacturing, currently study the carbon intensities of different transportation fuels. I specialize in understanding the science behind, and policies around, various biofuels, but have recently begun looking at unconventional sources of oil (such as tar sands and tight oil). It’s clear that our fuel mix is changing; it’s less clear what road we’ll take, and what it’ll mean for the climate.

Earlier this year I published “[Fueling a Clean Transportation Future](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/clean-fuels/transportation-fuels-future),” a report that compares the different futures that lay ahead of gasoline, electricity, and ethanol. Just this week we also published an online web feature that looks at some of these issues, that you can use [here](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/oil-is-changing).

* Is there a practical way for there to be a converter of some sort put on exhaust stacks for power plants, or potentially a converter on a jet engine, cruise ships, and container ships?  The automotive industry in the US has pretty strict emissions standards, where the aviation and maritime industry does not.

* Is there a way for these converters to eliminate CO and CO2 from exiting the exhaust of combustion in a car, power plant, or cargo/container ships so we eliminate those as sources for CO2 completely?  Is it possible for a converter to capture or convert all the CO2 from a combustion engine?

* Is there a way through chemistry that we can use an additive in gasoline, diesel, Jet A, Jet A-1, or heavy fuel oil to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted by burning these fuels?

Source of reading on my interest of the historical North American climate.

https://www2.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html
The images presented here show the paleogeography of North America over the last 550 million years of geologic history. The 40 images shown here are selected from a suite of approximately 100 maps that are in time slices mostly 5-10 million years apart. By using such tightly spaced time slices, individual paleogeographic and tectonic elements can be followed and intuitively related from time slice to adjacent time slice. Because of space limitations only 40 of the 100 images are presented here but but most shifts of tectonic elements and depositional systems can still be followed. The maps were prepared with the core of North America (Laurentia) fixed. All other tectonic elements are shown moving against or splitting away from Laurentia, thus showing clearly accretionary and rifting events in North America's geologic history. The views were prepared by wrapping a rectangular outline map on a sphere and viewing the globe rotated to 35° N and 100° W. Various stratigraphic, tectonic, and sedimentologic data were added to the map. Topography was ""cloned"" from digital elevation maps of modern Earth from the USGS, NOAA, and other sources. Colors were adjusted to portray climate and vegetation for the given time and location. The geologic data were gathered from the references listed below.

ctptwvi,science,scientific,,">most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. 

This seems to be a very important distinction, and I'm amazed that the observation that the models and observations were actually showing different measurements has not been made public before this.  

There has been a claim that most of the warming i the last 15 to 18 years has gone into the oceans below the surface, and that's why the models and observations have diverged over that time period.  There are models of projected sea temperature changes, and I believe those models do not model the air 2 meters above, but actual water temperatures. 

Given that the models that we are normally presented with have historically depicted air temperatures, and 71% of the planet is ocean, where air temperatures are not measured, but water temperatures are, and given that we know that the ocean depths are warming, but water takes a lot more energy per unit temperature change, is the current use of air temperature at the surface in any way a reasonable way to depict Climate Change?  

The biggest, most often used warning issued by Climate Scientists and activists is that the world will warm by 3º ± 1.5º C after a doubling of CO2.  But, is that ""air temperature, 2 meters off the ground?"" and if we're not measuring the air temperature, 2 meters off the ground for most of the planet, should we be using a different warning altogether?

According to Wise's calculations linked to above, if we want to stop climate change, but also want 9 billion people by 2050 to have the standard of living the EU has in 2007, CO2 per dollar of GDP will have to decline from 768 in 2007, to just 14 grams per dollar by 2050.

That looks really difficult to me on first sight, so I have the following questions:

Is it really possible to reconcile the desire for economic growth with the desire to address climate change?

Should we look at a steady-state economy, that no longer grows, as a solution to climate change?

As both a moderator here and somebody who frequently spends (perhaps ""wastes"") a lot of timing debating with climate change deniers online, it's clear to see that many of the online commenters are just the tip of a mass media effort to redefine climate change as a political argument in order to detract from the science and make the implications of climate change something to dismiss as socialist/liberal alarmism. Many popular mass media publications regularly ridicule the scientists and science of climate change, and anyone that accepts the science in general, all the while driving home the point that it's a political issue, not a scientific or even societal one. Then reaching further up the ladder, we see entire political parties express almost venomous hate toward anything climate science, while even the governments that claim to believe the science are still mostly allowing and often encouraging fossil fuel explorations.

The plan to *prevent* meaningful action on climate change does appear to have been an enormous success.

So, my main question is, what will it take to change this?

Protesting and writing letters to our representatives doesn't appear to have done enough so far. Often it seems that people are even more politically entrenched in their opposition to climate change actions nowadays than a decade ago. Almost every national and international scientific institution has declared that climate change is real and caused by human activities, thousands of scientific reports and papers are published every year, evidence is constantly accumulating to show that we are the cause and things are already becoming unstable, yet here we still are, applying all this work and effort only for our wheels to continue spinning in the mud.

My question is about the climate thresholds.

Further, by using this global MODIS NPP dataset, you are mixing productivity of many different kinds of vegetation. For example, the climate thresholds for a cornfield in Iowa are probably different than those of a patch of Amazon forest. 

It seems like you could do a similar analysis (possibly more informative) using thresholds for specific regions and vegetation types. **Could you could rerun the analysis by dominant vegetation type (using vegetation-type specific thresholds) and show that say corn productivity will likely rise in the Midwest but soy productivity will decline in Brazil?** I'm sure you've thought of this, but I just wonder if it's feasible.",,5,,,,,thigmotroph,1747573190.21589,climate science,scientific,t3_3hkoun,3hkoun
cu8bepr,science,scientific,,"Double-counting of climate impacts

Posted by RichardBetts on 11 Jun 2015 at 15:27 GMT --on PLOS Biology.

One of the other very odd things about this paper is how the authors have decided that it is legitimate to ""adjust"" the net primary productivity (NPP) projections from the CMIP5 models on the basis of the so-called ""unsuitable plant growth days"" which have been diagnosed from the CMIP5 climate. Irrespective of Colin Prentice's and Trevor Keenan's concerns (which I share) about the validity of these ""unsuitable days"", this seems like double-counting of climate change impacts.

The CMIP5 NPP simulations *already* take account of meteorological factors, often on a much finer timescale than Mora et al, and certainly in a way which is process-based as opposed to correlations. The HadGEM2-ES model, for example, uses meteorological and hydrological quantities on time steps of less than one hour to drive the NPP calculations. This means that the model is already not allowing plants to grow when it's too hot, dry etc. This is already factored in to the CMIP5 NPP projections. For these projections to then be adjusted further on the basis of a second (and less sophisticated) interpretation of the meteorology is giving undue weight to the unfavourable conditions.

I also find it strange that the authors pick and choose which components of the CMIP5 models they will use, without realising that all the components interact. They are somewhat dismissive of CO2 effects on plants when it comes to their effects on growth, but overlook the fact that these effects also contribute to the climate change itself through the surface energy and moisture budget. Warming over land is projected to be larger because of CO2 effects on vegetation, and this also affects evaporation and precipitation. By discarding the CO2 effects in one part of the system but not the other, the authors are introducing an inconsistency.

How (not?) to estimate changes in the suitability of days for plant growth

Posted by colinprentice on 11 Jun 2015 at 10:47 GMT

Implications of global environmental change for the growth of plants (whether as natural ecosystems, managed forests, or crops) are a hot topic. Key aspects, such as the control of leaf canopy temperatures, the ability of plants to acclimate to high temperatures, and the effectiveness of CO2 ""fertilization"" and water saving by plants at high CO2 under different environmental conditions, are incompletely understood. There are obvious concerns, for example, for regions that are undergoing increasing drought and where this trend is projected to continue, and about the major geographic changes in global agriculture that will be necessary if ""high-end"" climate change projections come about.

This paper attempts to cut through these complexities by means of an empirical analysis of net primary production (NPP) derived from satellite observations. The results are dramatically more pessimistic than previously published analyses obtained with Earth System models, which have many of their own uncertainties and problems. However, there are good reasons to suspect that these new results are strongly biased towards a ""glass half empty"" interpretation of the evidence. In summary:

1. The specific method adopted implicitly assumes that climate combinations that are rare today are unsuitable for plant growth. So for example, projected future increases in temperature and rainfall together might create novel environments that would be suitable for plant growth, but the method assumes they are not suitable. This approach produces some strange but presumably significant side-effects, such as an upper temperature threshold that is below the optimum for photosynthesis as observed in many species.

2. The quantity analysed, called MODIS NPP, is not a measurement of NPP. It is a model of NPP, that has previously been criticized for the way in which it treats plant respiration, which tends to exacerbate the modelled effects of warming on NPP.

3. The approach assumes that any positive effects of CO2 concentration on growth or water use by plants do not exist. This is one extreme position on a continuing controversy. The authors refer to an ""over-emphasis"" on CO2 fertilization in current Earth System models, but they do not present evidence for their view which is, as far as I know, impossible to reconcile with the continuing and strong uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the land.

NPP = Suitable Plant Growing Days * Growth Per Suitable Day?

2. Doesn't this mean that even if the number of Suitable Plant Growing Days *decrease*, the total plant growth/NPP can still *increase* if the growth increase per day is sufficiently high?

3. Looking at your Fig. 6, this figure shows the NPP. It shows that NPP by 2100 will actually *increase* in every scenario - even after accounting for decreases in Suitable Plant Growing Days.

cts266c,sustainability,action-oriented,,"Great argument. I've honestly not heard many arguments from your side of the fence about agriculture. I have to agree that we should make food as efficiently as possible, with as little impact to our health and the land. I don't have a problem with GMOs as long as they are well tested (I did hear that many of the strains coming from Monsanto have certain genes that may be bad for humans in subtle ways. [This isn't the original article I read, but one i found quickly](http://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/regulators-discover-a-hidden-viral-gene-in-commercial-gmo-crops/)) and I think that they hold the key to a lot of agricultural improvement.

I'm glad that there are people in the industry like you who seem to be very level headed on the issue, but I also think that there are some general issues with farming trends that Organic farming purportedly improves. In the 100% profit driven market of farming that we see in the US, there doesn't seem to be a huge push for improving nutritional value of foods. I think the rise of mono-cultures in farming is probably a bad thing (how many of those diseases/plights from that TED talk might have been mitigated if we had greater biodiversity, do we know?). I think that farmers are still given incentive to inefficiently fertilize (e.g. getting the last 5% yield requires 50% more fertilizer but the economics still work out), leading to massive ocean dead zones which do nothing to the farmers profits but has a large societal costs (and costs to fishing industry).  I like that organics promote seasonal and local consumption, which I've been hearing more about the benefits of lately.

My question is, How do I support these sorts of improvements in agriculture in a way that doesn't blindly support organic farming, including it's demerits. I currently subscribe to a CSA and I think it is the best I can do. I assume they use organic methods for farming and strive for minimalist impact on the land. It also avoids a large amount of food waste from distributors, even if I do receive some strange looking fruits/veggies on occasion. They may be much less efficient in terms of yield, but I believe they are still probably ""better"" in terms of energy input (specifically fossil carbon produced), total toxins released and water used, per calorie grown.

I’m here to discuss the crucial role for chemistry in addressing climate change challenges, Ask me Anything!","Hello Reddit! I co-direct the [King’s Centre for Visualization in Science](http://www.kcvs.ca) and am professor of chemistry at the [King’s University](http://www.kingsu.ca) in Edmonton, Canada. I’m the past-chair of the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry’s (IUPAC) Committee on Chemistry Education and served on the American Chemical Society Presidential Climate Science Working group.

Climate change is a defining challenge of the 21st Century – we’ve got to tackle this with all the scientific tools and imagination we have! Key stakeholders are in our chemistry classrooms right now, so both chemistry education and public awareness have important roles to play. In recent work on the planetary boundary framework that defines a safe operating space for humanity, climate change has been identified (Steffen, Rockström, et al, Science Feb 13, 2015) as one of only two core planetary boundaries with the potential on its own to drive the earth system into a new state, should the boundary be substantially and persistently exceeded. Much of the science underlying earth’s climate relies heavily on measurements and insights from the molecular sciences - so there are compelling reasons for the profession of chemistry to contribute to public understanding of the basic science and the challenges. Sustainable and green chemistry have crucial roles to play in working toward solutions. Did (or do) you experience these connections in the chemistry courses you took?

Check out three resources as you explore how fundamental understanding of chemistry relates to climate change challenges and solutions.
[Explainingclimatechange.com](http://www.explainingclimatechange.com) - An IUPAC legacy project for the International Year of Chemistry to provide a set of critically reviewed, interactive, web-based learning tools to help students, teachers, science professionals and the general public make sense of the underlying science of climate change.

[ACS Climate Science Toolkit](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience.html) introduces the science of climate change to chemists.
I will be back at 11 am ET. Please AMA about the role for chemistry in addressing climate change challenges and in contributing green & sustainable chemistry solutions. I’m also very interested in discussing how chemistry education can empower the next generation of scientists and citizens to address these issues, and make chemistry more motivating and interesting at the same time.

Hi, I see some really interesting and important questions have been coming in. I’m live now and will start tackling them.  I’m delighted to be joined today by a group of 3rd and 4th year undergraduate chemistry students who have been studying green chemistry, and by Dr. Jerry Bell, who chaired the talented ACS Presidential Climate Science Working Group that created the ACS toolkit.

It is one of the remotest, coldest, driest places on Earth, we are 1200 km from the coast and our nearest neighbour is 600 km away: the Russian station Vostok. The landscape is an immense white, flat surface of compacted snow extending 1000 km in all directions. The snow and ice on which we walk is more than 3 km thick. Living here is like living on another planet, ‘Planet Concordia’ or ‘White Mars’. During the nine months of winter from February to November, the station is completely isolated from the rest of the world. No plane or vehicle can reach us, even in an emergency as the harsh weather conditions make all travel impossible. We have experienced temperatures down to –80°C and three months of complete darkness. The multicultural crew is consists of 13 people: seven for logistics and six scientists. We are five Italians, one Swiss, one English and six French. This year we are three women and ten men from 24 to 56 years old. We must rely on our own skills and teamwork while being prepared to face any kind of emergency through training, fire, rescue and medical exercises.

Antarctica is the largest, most extreme, multi-disciplinary, open-air scientific laboratory that helps us understand the mechanisms that regulate our planet, its climate, its history and offers a platform to observe and understand the structure of the universe, as well as charting the adaptation of humans to harsh environments. Thanks to the Antarctic Treaty, nations worldwide collaborate peacefully with respect for this environment in the name of science. We are one of very few stations at the heart of the Antarctic continent, so Concordia stands as an important node in the Earth Observatory Grid, for fields such as meteorology, seismology, geomagnetism and atmospheric chemistry.

**Hello there, /r/Science!**

We* are a group of researchers who just [published a paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064888/abstract) showing previous comparisons of global temperatures change from observations and climate models were comparing slightly different things, causing them to appear to disagree far more than they actually do.

The lead author Kevin Cowtan has a backgrounder on the paper [here](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/robust2015/background.html) and data and code posted [here](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/robust2015/methods.html). Coauthor /u/ed_hawkins also did a background post on his blog [here](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2015/an-apples-to-apples-comparison-of-global-temperatures/). 

Basically, the observational temperature record consists of land surface measurements which are taken at 2m off the ground, and sea surface temperature measurements which are taken from, well, the surface waters of the sea. However, most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. The actual sea surface temperature warms at a slightly lower rate than the air above it in climate models, so this apples to oranges comaprison makes it look like the models are running too hot compared to observations than they actually are. This gets further complicated when dealing with the way the temperature at the sea ice-ocean boundaries are treated, as these change over time. All of this is detailed in greater length in Kevin's backgrounder and of course in the paper itself. 

The upshot of our paper is that climate models and observations are in better agreement than some recent comparisons have made it seem, and we are basically warming inline with model expectations when we also consider differences in the modeled and realized forcings and internal climate variability (e.g. [Schmidt et al. 2014](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150000726.pdf)).

I’m Jim Hansen, a professor at [Columbia University’s Earth Institute]( http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9).<http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9> I'm  joined today by 3 colleagues who are scientists representing different aspects of climate science and coauthors on papers we'll be talking about on this AMA.

--Paul Hearty, paleoecologist and professor at University of North Carolina at Wilmington, NC Dept. of Environmental Studies. “I study the geology of sea-level changes”

--George Tselioudis, of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies; “I head a research team that analyzes observations and model simulations to investigate cloud, radiation, and precipitation changes with climate and the resulting radiative feedbacks.”

--Pushker Kharecha from Columbia University Earth Institute; “I study the global carbon cycle; the exchange of carbon in its various forms among the different components of the climate system --atmosphere, land, and ocean.”

Today we make the case for urgent action to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are on the verge of locking in highly undesirable consequences, leaving young people with a climate system out of humanity's control. Not long after my 1988 testimony to Congress, when I concluded that human-made climate change had begun, practically all nations agreed in a 1992 United Nations Framework Convention to reduce emissions so as to avoid dangerous human-made climate change.  Yet little has been done to achieve that objective.

I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss with researchers and general science readers here on redditscience an alarming situation — as the science reveals climate threats that are increasingly alarming, policymakers propose only ineffectual actions while allowing continued development of fossil fuels that will certainly cause disastrous consequences for today's young people. Young people need to understand this situation and stand up for their rights.

To further a broad exchange of views on the implications of this research, my colleagues and I have published in a variety of open access journals, including, in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648),
[PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648), and most recently, [Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from the Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling that 2 C Global Warming is Highly Dangerous](http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/2015/20150704_IceMelt.pdf), in [Atmos. Chem. & Phys. Discussions](http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/volumes_and_issues.html) (July, 2015).

One conclusion we share in the latter paper is that ice sheet models that guided [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](http://www.ipcc.ch/) sea level projections and upcoming United Nations meetings in Paris are far too sluggish compared with the magnitude and speed of sea level changes in the paleoclimate record. An implication is that continued high emissions likely would result in multi-meter sea level rise this century and lock in continued ice sheet disintegration such that building cities or rebuilding cities on coast lines would become foolish.

The bottom line message we as scientists should deliver to the public and to policymakers is that we have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical. We conclude and reaffirm in our present paper that the crisis calls for an across-the-board rising carbon fee and international technical cooperation in carbon-free technologies. This urgent science must become part of a global conversation about our changing climate and what all citizens can do to make the world livable for future generations.

We’re Camilo Mora and Iain Caldwell, here to talk about our paper in PLOS Biology that investigates how plant growth is impacted by climate change — AUA!","My name is Dr. Camilo Mora and I am an assistant professor at the [University of Hawaii Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). My research focuses on understanding the feedback loops between people and biodiversity. My earlier career was on basic ecology, but then I realized that the effects of people on various species were massive and already evident. Quantifying such impacts and their feedbacks on people represent the main topic of my latest research.


And my name is Dr. Iain Caldwell and I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [University of Hawaii Manoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). I am an ecologist with broad interests in how organisms can respond to changes in their environment, including the potential consequences of projected climate changes for such organisms.


Along with several colleagues from the University of Hawaii and the [University of Montana](http://www.umt.edu/), we recently published a study in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology) titled [Suitable Days for Plant Growth Disappear under Projected Climate Change: Potential Human and Biotic Vulnerability](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002167). In this paper, we explored the potential consequences of projected climate changes on future plant growth worldwide, and what that could mean for various ecosystems and the people that depend on those ecosystems.


Our findings indicate that, if climate change continues as it has in the past, there could be significant global declines in the number of suitable plant growing days by 2100; with the most drastic changes affecting people in the poorest countries of the world. There is hope though; as our results also indicate that if we can curb our global carbon emissions, these changes in plant-growing conditions should be far less severe.

Bill Patzert -- Hi everybody! I’ve been an oceanographer and climate scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for 32 years. My research is focused on improving our understanding of important environmental problems ranging from El Niño and La Niña to longer-term climate change, especially important water issues, like our present punishing drought in the American West. I always try to balance my scientific research with a sense of social responsibility. In the final balance, the ultimate test of any science is if it has a credible use for public policy. During my career, I have attempted to communicate what I think we do know to as many people in the science community, the general public and the private sector as I can. I look forward to your questions.

Narendra Das -- I’m a research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I currently work for the NASA’s SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission. I developed an algorithm to retrieve global, high-resolution soil moisture data from the SMAP measurements that will provide significant information to monitor agricultural and hydrological droughts, and will also help improve the skills of weather and climate models to forecast drought, its onset and recovery.

Ben Zaitchik -- I'm a hydrologist and climate scientist in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on modern day drought patterns, drought prediction, and potential changes in drought patterns under climate change. Most of my work is on East Africa and the Middle East--two regions where drought has significant human impacts, and where climate change has the potential to intensify the severity of droughts in coming years.

The mix is constantly made airborne by crashing oceans waves through sea spray, which ultimately impacts cloud properties and the energy balance of the planet. That’s because sea spray can influence the amount of sunlight that clouds reflect away from the Earth and its oceans, which normally act as a heat sink for the planet.

I’m Kathy Crane, an oceanographer and manager of NOAA’s Arctic Research Program (www.arctic.noaa.gov). We study the Arctic and how its physical environment is changing — and how those changes are impacting ecosystems. I also contribute to the Arctic Council’s Conservation of Flora and Fauna Working group and lead a team of U.S. Arctic experts to design and carry out observations of marine ecosystems all across the Arctic Ocean. In fact, I’ve spent a lot of time doing research in the Arctic. 

Each year NOAA leads an international group of scientists to produce the Arctic Report Card, an annual update on the Arctic environment. We take a close look at snow, ice, ocean temperatures, fish, other wildlife, air temperatures and climate. Our reports are showing that the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere on earth. These changes don’t stay in the Arctic, but have effects on people, climate and global security well beyond this region. With 2014 being recently confirmed as the warmest year on record for the globe, studying what is happening in the Arctic is more important than ever.

I’ll be here from 1:00 pm ET through 3:00 pm ET today answering your questions about Arctic climate research as well as what it’s like to work in this spectacular part of the world … AMA!

AMA!","Thanks everyone who submitted questions! If you have any more questions, please check out our current project site and ask us more questions there!  [Experiment.com/vernal](http://Experiment.com/vernal)

For anyone joining after our AMA, for the past few years we’ve worked on a project looking at wetland hydrology and animal habitat use in the Pacific Northwest.  We’re interested in how and when ponds up in the mountains dry up and get wet again, how they respond to precipitation events during the summer when animals are active, and how different animals (mainly amphibians) use the wetlands based on their hydrology (fast-drying, or slow-drying, or never-drying).  We’re interested in how wetlands respond to climate change and how this will affect the animals that use them in the future.

Currently we’re working to expand the scope of our monitoring of temporary wetlands to the east coast of North America. The data we collect there that will allow us to develop more sophisticated models of hydrologic change and its effects on wildlife.  For the past four years we’ve worked in mountain wetlands in Washington State, but this spring we will be working with vernal pools in Massachusetts.  The wetlands in both regions differ enormously in ecological context (high in the western mountains, versus down in coastal forest), but are similar in that they are temporary ponds upon which a fascinating suite of amphibians depend. We look forward to learning how to adapt our methods from one region to a very different one, and further from there.

The current expedition is Expedition 359: Maldives Monsoon, aboard the U.S. vessel for scientific ocean drilling, the JOIDES Resolution www.joidesresolution.org. On this expedition we are exploring the story of climate change and of times past (paleoclimatic changes). Using core samples from  off the coast of the Maldives the scientists aim to reconstruct paleoceanographic evolution over the past 23 million years. Drilling will provide cores required for reconstructing changing current systems through time that are directly related to the evolution of the Indian monsoon. As such the drift deposits will provide a continuous record of Indian monsoon development in the region. One important outcome of Expedition 359 is ground-truthing the hypothesis that the dramatic, pronounced change in the style of the sedimentary carbonate sequence stacking was caused by a combination of relative sea level fluctuations and ocean current system changes. The scientific objectives are to:
-	explore the variation in regional monsoon systems over multi-million year time scales
-	learn how scientists reconstruct the causes of fluctuations in ocean currents and triggers of evolution
-	learn how sea level respond to a warming climate
-	learn about magnitude and rate of past sea level change
A team of 30 scientists from around the globe are on board for two months to work on these questions. Hand-in-hand with the amazing technology required to drill deep into the ocean floor, we are collecting the core samples that hold clues to answer these questions.

We often harness energetic discharges from capacitor banks to cause metal to be formed, joined, cut or modified, enabling new products, such as welds between un-weldable","Hello, I am Glenn Daehn, a professor of materials science and engineering at The Ohio State University.  I find great joy and concern in manufacturing process innovation.  On the joy side, my group is working in the unusual area of impulse manufacturing.  This is using short-duration, high-amplitude pressure pulses that we use to make things.  Usually we shape, cut or weld materials using very high pressures or speeds.  Capacitor bank discharge is typically where the energy is stored, and this is then it is turned to mechanical work in one of a number of ways such as by a Lorentz magnetic repulsion from a coil, or by developing a very large pressure pulse by vaporizing a shaped thin metal foil.  Examples of what we do are available at my group’s website at http://iml.osu.edu.  Recently, we have had great interest in using this as a method for the solid-state welding of metals.  To allow us to get into a deep and geeky conversation on this, I’ve prepared a fairly rapid-pace 35 minute lecture on this that you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H3M8yLKNjY&spfreload=10

We are very interested in developing these impulse manufacturing techniques as go-to methods for manufacturing.  Two things lack.  First is a good design-science foundation for this work.  We (and other researchers -- see: http://i2fg.org) are developing that now, and we have invested in some great instrumentation.  Second, we need to disseminate these ideas and get some early adopters into this space.  I am grateful to reddit for helping sine some light on this technical area.

At the risk of diluting the technical conversation, we may also discuss the overall climate for process innovation in America.  The US does a breathtakingly good job of top-rate academic research. But in my opinion, we only do a marginal job of process innovation when it comes to new physical systems in areas like metal processing and manufacturing, which are vital to our economy, sustainability and security.  I’d be happy to discuss if the US is making the right investments and training people with the right skills to innovate in capital-intensive industries. I think the maker movement and projects like the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation institutes represent great steps in the right direction, but wonder if they are sufficient when we look around our competitive world.

AMA!","If there ever was a problem that’s hard to solve, it’s climate change. But we now have a new, and potentially more effective, way of solving complex global challenges: online crowdsourcing. 


In our work at the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, we’re exploring the potential of crowdsourcing to help solve the world’s most difficult societal problems, starting with climate change. We’ve created the Climate CoLab, an on-line platform where experts and non-experts from around the world collaborate on developing and evaluating proposals for what to do about global climate change. 


In the same way that reddit opened up the process of headlining news, the Climate CoLab opens up the elite conference rooms and meeting halls where climate strategies are developed today. We’ve broken down the complex problem of climate change into a series of focused sub-problems, and invite anyone in the world to submit ideas and get feedback from a global community of over 34,000 people, which includes many world-renowned experts.  We recently also launched a new initiative where members can build climate action plans on the regional (US, EU, India, China, etc.) and global levels. 


Prof. Thomas W. Malone: I am the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  I have spent most of my career working on the question of how new information technologies enable people to work together in new ways.  After I published a book on this topic in 2004 called The Future of Work, I decided that I wanted to focus on what was coming next—what was just over the horizon from the things I talked about in my book.  And I thought the best way to do that was to think about how to connect people and computers so that—collectively—they could act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has ever done before.  I thought the best term for this was “collective intelligence,” and in 2006 we started the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  One of the first projects we started in the new center was what we now call the Climate CoLab.  It’s come a long way since then!


Laur Fisher:  I am the project manager of the Climate CoLab and lead the diverse and talented team of staff and volunteers to fulfill the mission of the project. I joined the Climate CoLab in May 2013, when the platform had just under 5,000 members.  Before this, I have worked for a number of non-profits and start-ups focused on sustainability, in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and the U.S.  What inspires me the most about the Climate CoLab is that it’s future-oriented and allows for a positive conversation about what we can do about climate change, with the physical, political, social and economic circumstances that we have.

We are signing off now, but feel free to keep posting your questions and we will try to answer as many as we can. 

+++++
We are three researchers from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and one from Utah State University’s Department of Environment & Society. We are excited to answer your questions about how Americans in different parts of the country compare in their climate change beliefs, attitudes, and policy support.

This week, we released a new interactive mapping tool called “Yale Climate Opinion Maps” (YCOM) and an accompanying peer-reviewed paper in the journal Nature Climate Change. This tool allows users to visualize and explore differences in public opinion about global warming in the United States in unprecedented geographic detail. Nationally, 52% of Americans are worried about global warming. But this national number glosses over the enormous geographic diversity in public opinion across the country – diversity that is revealed for the first time in these maps. Explore the maps at: http://environment.yale.edu/poe/v2014/. 

We undertook this project because most of the action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate impacts is happening at the state and local levels of American society. Yet most know little about public climate change opinion at these sub-national levels. State and local surveys are costly and time intensive, and as a result most public opinion polling is only done at the national level. 

The estimates contained in the tool are based on a geographic and statistical model developed by our research team at Yale and Utah State University. The model uses the large quantity of national survey data that we have collected over the years — over 13,000 individual survey responses since 2008 — to estimate differences in opinion between geographic and demographic groupings. As a result, we are able to provide high-resolution estimates of public climate change understanding, risk perceptions, and policy support in all 50 states, 435 Congressional districts, and 3,000+ counties across the United States.

We’re Laura Stevens and Dr. Sarah Das, glaciologists at MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, here to talk about all things ice! AMA!","Yesterday we published a [paper in Nature on supraglacial lake drainages on the Greenland Ice Sheet](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=50242&tid=3622&cid=217909). Supraglacial lakes form on the surface of the ice sheet during the summer, when temperatures get above freezing in the daytime. In a 2008 study, we discovered that these lakes, some of which are miles wide, can drain in a matter of hours through long cracks known as hydro-fractures that open in the lakebed. These drainage events send a flood of meltwater comparable to Niagra Falls thousands of feet straight down to the bottom of the ice sheet.  The meltwater causes the ice to temporarily speed up, moving more ice to the edge of the ice sheet where it calves off into the ocean as icebergs. It’s important to know where and when lakes will drain in order to predict how fast the ice sheet is moving and how much the ice sheet contributes to sea level rise.  

Since that study in 2008 we have been working hard to figure out what triggers these hydro-fractures, and what that might mean for the future of the ice sheet (and for people elsewhere on the planet) in a warming climate. We do this by traveling every summer to lakes on the ice sheet via helicopter, setting up GPS stations around the lakes, and then using our measurements to observe how the ice sheet surface moves during lake drainage events. We found that enough meltwater gets down to the bottom of the ice sheet before the lake drains to cause the ice sheet surface to be pushed up and stretched. This stretching causes new fractures to form, and once one of those fractures intersects the lake, water from the lake drives the crack open and the lake is history.

3evxgv,science,scientific,"[Science AMA Series] American Chemical Society AMA: Hi, I am Kimberly Prather, a Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry at UC San Diego. We fly through clouds and break waves in the lab to study how aerosols impact our clouds, weather, and climate. AMA!","Hi Reddit-I am a Professor of Chemistry at UC San Diego. I hold a joint appointment in the Dept. of Chemistry and Biochemistry and also Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I have spent over 20 years studying the impact of atmospheric aerosols on air pollution, human health, and climate. Aerosols are solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere, which range from soot emitted from cars and wildfires to natural sources such as dust and sea spray.  Because of their extreme complexity, our overall understanding of how much they are affecting climate through interactions with clouds represents the single largest uncertainty in our overall understanding of climate change. Over the past two decades, my research group has performed field studies around the world on ships, aircraft, and in mobile laboratories aimed at determining the major sources of atmospheric aerosols.  Most recently, by performing unique aircraft measurements inside clouds, we have directly determined which particles seed clouds and how different sources can affect precipitation.  Surprisingly, we discovered that dust from as far away as Africa and microbes picked up over the oceans can affect the amount of snowfall over the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.  Yes, indeed aerosols from one continent can influence weather over another thousands of miles away!

I serve as the Director of an NSF Center for Chemical Innovation called the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment (http://caice.ucsd.edu, @CAICECCI). In CAICE, we transferred the complexity of the real world into a laboratory setting to perform controlled chemistry experiments that can be used to explain atmospheric observations. The Center brings together chemists with marine biologists and oceanographers to perform studies in a unique ocean-atmosphere facility which uses real seawater, breaking waves, and biology to control the composition of seawater and sea spray.  Using this new approach, we are rapidly learning new things about the ocean-atmosphere system. See a recent video posted on our most recent publication:
 
Prather, et al. (2013), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, “Bringing the ocean into the laboratory to probe the chemical complexity of sea spray aerosol”. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBX4Vl6-SMM))
 
So feel free to ask me anything about aerosols, clouds, aircraft studies, our wave machine, CAICE, atmospheric microbes, and chemistry. Also, happy to discuss steps we can take to help our planet and my thoughts on the importance of communicating our exciting science findings to the public. Finally, I am open to discussing my own career path to becoming an atmospheric chemistry professor.

I will be back at 1 pm ET to answer your questions. AMA!

EDIT I am here and ready to start answering questions. Very exciting to see so much interest in this topic. 

I am here at UC San Diego with a number of my students, CAICE faculty, and members of our research team--Dr. Doug Collins (CAICE managing director), Prof. Bob Continetti, Prof. Francesco Paesani, Jackie Dowling (undergrad visiting from Carleton College), Robin Richardson (UCSD undergrad), Kathryn Nadler (UCSD grad student), and Nicole Campbell (UCSD grad student)....We are going to start answering questions now.

I noticed there are a number of questions about cloud seeding so I will just answer broadly up here to start.  Many people are asking if we should /start/ cloud seeding but we already are doing so in many places in the world, including California since the late 1940's.  Little known fact.  We seed clouds in California due to our interest in hydroelectric power. The mechanism for enhancement is still not fully resolved and sometimes it appears to work, and other times it does not.  The question we are asking in our studies is how are the aerosol seeds produced by humans (aka pollution) affecting our rain and snowfall?  The idea is if you put too many (aerosol) seeds into a cloud, you make many tiny droplets that cannot grow big enough to fall--thus you can turn off precipitation in some regions with high levels of pollution.  When we went to study this in a region over our major watershed, we found a surprise--that Mother Nature was seeding clouds using aerosols transported from far away (Africa!) produced by natural sources, including dust and microbes. Nature appears to have figured out the perfect cloud seeding recipe which turns out to be quite different from the ones humans use.  Dust and microbes make ice in clouds at higher altitudes which grow and then fall and scavenge drops along the way leading to copious snowfall at the ground!  So...now I will go down thru the questions and answer those that this answer does not address.

We're the Lancet Commission on Public Health and Climate, a group of medical doctors, climate scientists, economists and energy experts that have recently released a major report on our policy options for reducing the health impacts of climate change.  Formally titled [Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health](http://www.thelancet.com/commissions/climate-change), this report not only details the many different ways global warming is a medical emergency, but more importantly it lays out some of our options for confronting this crisis. 

We can answer questions about how climate change impacts health (through things like heat waves or malaria) as well as the flip side, what we can do about the problem in terms of policies and economics. It turns out that when you switch from coal to low carbon energy, you not only help the climate, but also see an immediate health benefit. Hospital admissions decrease and cardiovascular and respiratory disease rates decrease, overall reducing costs for the healthcare system and improving countless lives, all while reducing carbon pollution.

You might think of Mars as Earth-like, but the South Pole of Mars is a strange and wonderful place unlike anything on Earth. During the winter, while the entire Martian South Pole is shrouded in complete darkness a a growing cap of carbon dioxide ice forms from the condensing atmosphere.  During the spring, carbon dioxide geysers from and loft dust and dirt through cracks in a thawing carbon dioxide ice sheet to the surface where it is believed that surface winds subsequently sculpt the material into dark fans observed from orbit. For nearly 10 years, the HiRISE camera (with 24.7 cm/pixel resolution) aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been imaging these seasonal processes. HiRISE is the highest resolution camera ever to sent to another planet. Hundreds of thousands of dark fans are visible in springtime HiRISE images. Automated computer routines have not been able to accurately identify and outline the individual fans in these images, but a human being intuitively can distinguish and outline these features.  Launched in January 2013, Planet Four (http://www.planetfour.org ) uses human pattern recognition to map the shape and direction of the fans visible in the HiRISE images in order to study the evolution of Mars' climate. Planet Four will also produce the largest areal coverage wind measurement of the Martian surface.

Many of  the surface features of Mars South Pole are sculpted by the never-ending cycle of freezing and thawing of exposed carbon dioxide ice and subsurface water ice. This features includes  'spiders' (radially organized channels carved in the surface), pitted sheets of carbon dioxide ice nicknamed Swiss Cheese Terrain, and channel networks carved by carbon dioxide gas trapped below the thawing ice sheet and also by the freezing and thawing of water ice permafrost. With Planet Four: Terrains (http://terrains.planetfour.org), we need your help to identify these different surfaces in images taken in orbit by the Context Camera (CTX). This is a task that is difficult for computers to do, but the human brain automatically identifies patterns. With your help, Planet Four:Terrains will find new and interesting regions of the Martian South Pole to study. Starting in July 2016 when sunlight returns to the South Pole, we'll point the HiRISE camera to monitor the evolution of these new targets of interest. The HiRISE observations will in the future be shown on the main Planet Four site to learn if there is fan and blotch formation and see how the process compares to other areas on the South Pole.

3dwrac,sustainability,action-oriented,Conventional vs Organic Farming,"I am a conventional farmer in Western Canada (growing wheat, canola, malt barley and oats), and am also a professional engineer (mechanical).  

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)

My first question is with regard to aerosols. The leveling off in global surface air temperatures between the 40s and 70s, and the subsequent rapid acceleration, is often attributed to industrially sourced aerosol pollution and then the clean air act respectively. We are now seeing China rapidly clean up it's act and reduce pollution levels. Might we see a substantial acceleration in global temperatures rise over the next few decades as a result?

On science communication, there has probably never been as big a battle between the scientific reality and corporate interests as we see now over climate change, with many myths and anti-climate change/science propaganda so pervasive within the public debate.

1. The joined material - can it be verified through non-destructive testing for errors?  Can this testing be done for each part on an assembly line or progressive die?  Ie. In a spot weld, you can use infrared to see areas that cool faster which indicate an air pocket or other issue since the weld should cool uniformly.  Can you use a technology such as ultrasonic or radiation to verify bonding?

2. Do you see this technology being used first person in some shape or form?  Ie. On military vehicles, a lot of the welding is done by hand.

3. As you know, maintenance cost of equipment on an assembly line can be very pricey.  This technology sounds like it can lower some of this cost.  Do you think if this technology was generic enough for prices to be competitive that it would lower the costs of maintenance on current welding lines?

cq7nf5v,science,scientific,,"First off, the map graphic is very well done. Even though I consider myself knowledgeable on the subject, seeing the the graphic change for each question helped put in perspective how widespread each idea is. I have no doubt that if this graphic were distributed, it would have a global impact. So kudos on good work well done.

1. Is ""global warming"" to be used interchangeably with ""climate change""? The two imply subtly different ideas, with climate change typically including a broader range effects like oceanic acidification, and [this study, also in part by Dr. Leiserowitz, has shown people respond differently to each term.](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/global-warming-vs-climate-change/) Would you predict significant proportional changes in response or would you expect to see all figures rise or fall somewhat uniformly? 
2. I would consider rewording the response concerning beliefs among the scientific community to more directly imply that this is the public's beliefs concerning the scientific community's belief. At present it seems (to me) to convey that the data is the reported belief BY the scientific community rather than the population's perception OF the scientific community. [Another of Dr. Leiserowitz's studies demonstrates  up to 97% of the scientific papers published agree climate change is happening and human caused](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/scientific-and-public-perspectives-on-climate-change)
3. The ""already harming in the US"" question seems strange to me. I'm not sure how to answer that question. Smog in LA can potentially cause cancer or emphysema, but smog is a contributing factor to global warming rather than a result. Some studies have suggested certain marine ecosystems have been negatively affected by acidification but that's more of a climate change issue than specifically global warming. I'm not sure what present harm people could be citing when they say they believe it is presently harming us. Am I misinformed here, and something is presently affecting us negatively, or does this statistic demonstrate that, at least in some regard, general understanding of global warming is based out of fear rather than understanding? I understand also there are hugely dissenting theories on when we will begin to feel the effects of climate change.

I know I'm pushing it with a fourth question, but this is, in a sense, the most important. Do you believe we have a moral obligation to act in a certain consequence-conscious manner regarding issues of climate change? If we do have some obligation, how widely does it span? How could we justifiably act as individuals and as a world-community to sufficiently award praise and blame for actions with relevant consequences? (e.g. is it morally acceptable to reform industrial setting in a way which would be more difficult, stressful, or perhaps dangerous for human workers if emissions were significantly cut? Does diminishing the risk of an eventual potential global catastrophe (rising ocean levels, permanently destroyed ecosystems, specie-loss, up to eventual global extinction) justify the worsened human condition?

On a whole though, it's actually quite positive, at least if ""Policy support"" polls are based of a strong opinion and not just a knee jerk reaction to the issue. Because even if people are not strongly in favor of the scientific literature, at least they don't mind actions against the issue itself.

 Given the uncertainty of how an individual peatland may respond to long-term climate change, as well as the significant local-and-continental-scale heterogeneity of peatland types, **how** difficult is it to include high latitude peatlands in climate change models?

Sorry for all the wind, and I promise that I'm not asking you to do my homework for me! Thanks

Firstly, with evidence growing of Arctic Amplification altering the polar jet stream and, in turn, changing mid latitude weather pattern, is this new area of research becoming more of a focus within NOAA? Related to that, do you find the tendency of the media (occasionally supported by some scientists) to quickly try and relate every weather event to climate change and AA to be a problem when trying to get across the actual science to the general public?

Secondly, with regard to native populations within the high Arctic, how much are the changes that have already happened impacting their lives and livelihoods, and how much worse could it get within the next few decades?

Finally, could you describe some of the uses your team will be making of (if any) ESA's new sentinel satellites and how they may help with monitoring of the Arctic environment over the coming decades?

coj6e60,science,scientific,,"Hi Dr. Crane. This is a wonderful AMA series. Thanks for taking part! A question:

This may be directed to Greenland and the Antarctic, but as climate change occurs and warming happens, we see continental, land-locked ice melt. Could this have a positive, scientific effect on the mapping of underwater features? 

For example, a rapid influx of sediment could not only produce turbidity flows that could be monitored, but the ever more elusive hyperpycnal flow. As sedimentation increases, and more attention is drawn to these areas, could the bathymetry be monitored more closely to see the development of contourite deposits?

I know that climate change is a real problem,  and a devastating one at that, but there has to be some positive outcomes we can use to further scientific understanding.
