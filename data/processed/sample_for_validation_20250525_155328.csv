erk8c6e,ClimateActionPlan,unknown,,"The thing about the climate crisis is *it's unprecedented*. 

That means even the biggest brains on the planet can only guess at how it plays out, what negative and positive feedback loops will be triggered, etc.

Keeping that in mind, I focus on two things:

**1. ""Horton Hears a Who""** In this Dr. Seuss story, a tiny world is contained on a speck of dust. In the climax (spoiler), all the people are screaming ""We're here! We're here! We're here!"" at the top of their lungs, but it's just not getting thru. *Until*. One last kid decides to help and just says ""Yop!"" and that is the final bit needed to break thru and save them.

I imagine each of us and each greenhouse gas reducing action we take, might be that final ""Yop!"" that saves us. That buys us *just* enough time for scientists to figure it out. So every little thing I do helps. And even if I can't get my family, friends, neighbors, government, corporations to do *everything* I want, each single thing I *can* get them to do might be the ""Yop!""

Unprecendented. We have no *precise* idea where the point-of-no-return tipping point is. So any ""Yop!"" might be the one we need.

**2. The Singularity.** If you haven't heard about it, read up on it a bit. Basically, our knowledge base and ability to process knowledge into useable ideas is growing *exponentially*. Which means technology is growing exponentially. And scientific understanding is growing exponentially.

So exponentially, that at some point, computers will solve problems *by themselves* exponentially faster than all the human brains on the planet ever could. It's astonishing (and a bit terrifying).

Combining the Singularity with ""Horton Hears a Who,"" to me the issue becomes buying science enough time to figure the thing out. We may never return to what we had pre-icecaps-melting, but it might not be as big an extinction and we likely would be able to restore a lot of the species lost over time.

In that more optimistic scenario, we all hustle our butts and do what we can, and the next age of human civilization is one where humans undo and restore. Finally acknowledging the incredible, miraculous interconnected web in each ecosystem, removing invasive species, removing pollutants, restoring natives in the original combinations, and one-piece-at-a-time repairing what we undid. Wow. How cool would that be? It might take a thousand years, but it could be done if it were profitable and government funded (not to mention culturally ""in"").

TL/DR I focus on the fact that no one *knows* for sure what will happen when and instead focus on doing everything I can to buy science and technology just enough time to figure out that last minute save.

Obviously, everyone feels this way.  There's no justifiable reason to be sad about not being able to stop aging.  If I'm justified in being sad about that, everyone on the planet should be constantly walking around in a depressed mopey state.

I don't deserve sympathy for this either.  If I deserve sympathy, everyone deserves sympathy for we are all aging. 

Nobody will care and morally nobody should care except for people like me - mid/late 20's, well off, my only problem is that I'm going to die from aging.  I'd expect less than 1% of the planet would feel sorry for me.

And even then, so what?  The purpose of sympathy is to motivate people to lend a helping hand.  Nobody can help me, at least not yet.  Ghandi said ""be the change you wish to see in the world"", and that is so true, so it's really up to me right?

Okay... so why is this even sad in the first place.  I'm sad because this quest is causing me to lose out on a bunch of other things that I could be doing.  But I remember, now, the pitfall of measuring the opportunity cost of your own actions.  Every door you walk through also closes a million other doors, but if you never walk through any doors they might as well all be closed.

I don't get to pursue the perfect family environment.  
I don't get to join the Air Force.  
I don't get to be relateable.  
I don't get to hang out with the guys.  
I don't get likes on facebook.  
I don't get to commiserate with friends in a bar, drinking the night away and talking about the thing we are all interested in, interested down to the depth of our very being, that thing that defines all of us and that binds us together making us a strong team that can take on all challenges and overcome any obstacle.

I'm probably going to experience decades of failure.  I'm going to exist outside of the safe human existence, working toward something which may in the end be futile anyway.  And nobody will care, and nobody should care, because the current rules of the universe dictate that acceptance of death is morally correct and you shouldn't fight against it.

...

But humans couldn't fly for hundreds of years.  It was stupid, it was against our biology.  Flying humans?  If humans were meant to fly, we'd be born with wings.  You fucking morons, stop trying to make humans fly.  Stop it!  It's unnatural!  It's - oh, it's possible?  Well I knew it all along, it was inevitable.  I mean, birds do it, how hard could it have been, really.

I'm dumb.  At least, I'm going to be known as dumb unless I succeed.  Smart people know death is inevitable.  They look at the billions who died before them, and the billions dying now, and they realize the weight of it all.  Smart people say ""I accept death, and in the face of it I embrace life"".  And I'm forced to call them smart because they are accepting the reality of our situation more than I am.  I'm the one who isn't accepting reality, by trying to fight aging.  Ethically, I'm dumb.  But goddamnit I do not want to die.

*It's a selfish endeavor*.  *By wanting to live forever, you are cancer.  You are the cancer of the human race*.

I understand death and I'd rather not participate in it. Obviously, everyone feels this way. There's no justifiable reason to be sad about not being able to stop aging. If I'm justified in being sad about that, everyone on the planet should be constantly walking around in a depressed mopey state. I don't deserve sympathy for this either. If I deserve sympathy, everyone deserves sympathy for we are all aging. Nobody will care and morally nobody should care except for people like me - mid/late 20's, well off, my only problem is that I'm going to die from aging. I'd expect less than 1% of the planet would feel sorry for me. And even then, so what? The purpose of sympathy is to motivate people to lend a helping hand. Nobody can help me, at least not yet. Ghandi said ""be the change you wish to see in the world"", and that is so true, so it's really up to me right? Okay... so why is this even sad in the first place. I'm sad because this quest is causing me to lose out on a bunch of other things that I could be doing. But I remember, now, the pitfall of measuring the opportunity cost of your own actions. Every door you walk through also closes a million other doors, but if you never walk through any doors they might as well all be closed. I don't get to pursue the perfect family environment. I don't get to join the Air Force. I don't get to be relateable. I don't get to hang out with the guys. I don't get likes on facebook. I don't get to commiserate with friends in a bar, drinking the night away and talking about the thing we are all interested in, interested down to the depth of our very being, that thing that defines all of us and that binds us together making us a strong team that can take on all challenges and overcome any obstacle. I'm probably going to experience decades of failure. I'm going to exist outside of the safe human existence, working toward something which may in the end be futile anyway. And nobody will care, and nobody should care, because the current rules of the universe dictate that acceptance of death is morally correct and you shouldn't fight against it. ... But humans couldn't fly for hundreds of years. It was stupid, it was against our biology. Flying humans? If humans were meant to fly, we'd be born with wings. You fucking morons, stop trying to make humans fly. Stop it! It's unnatural! It's - oh, it's possible? Well I knew it all along, it was inevitable. I mean, birds do it, how hard could it have been, really. I'm dumb. At least, I'm going to be known as dumb unless I succeed. Smart people know death is inevitable. They look at the billions who died before them, and the billions dying now, and they realize the weight of it all. Smart people say ""I accept death, and in the face of it I embrace life"". And I'm forced to call them smart because they are accepting the reality of our situation more than I am. I'm the one who isn't accepting reality, by trying to fight aging. Ethically, I'm dumb. But goddamnit I do not want to die. *It's a selfish endeavor*. *By wanting to live forever, you are cancer. You are the cancer of the human race*. No. I disagree. I've internalized death. I've internalized the slaughter happening outside. 150,000 people per day. That's worse than any war or human atrocity I've ever read about.

aaab2d,climate,scientific,Idea: How insight in my own Carbon Footprint could lead to a better world,"I recently had a discussion with family members during our Christmas dinner regarding global warming and how each of us as individual (whether we want it or not) contributes to the whole issue. What we concluded is that without insight into our own carbon footprints (as an estimator of environmental impact of the individual), it is hard for a willing individual to make (daily) responsible decisions that limit the extend to which these contribute to global warming.

&#x200B;

What would be the gains of such insight in your own carbon footprint:

By gaining insight into how my daily decisions (e.g. consumer behaviour when buying groceries, buying environmentally friendly clothing, ride my bike rather than drive my car) affect my carbon footprint, I think I'll become more aware and stimulated to gradually reduce my footprint over time. Additionally, I could see synergies between corporate & governmental institutions as this would open up incentives for promoting environmentally friendly behaviour (e.g. reduction in taxes, promoting the use of alternative transportation to the office).

&#x200B;

So here is my idea and (roughly) how it would work:

The idea is to create an product/service that gives the individual insight in his/her carbon footprint. This service would be based on an ever increasing database infrastructure, as the IoT gives us more and more data to draw conclusions from (maybe blockchain provides a solution for data reliability & validity here). The service/product would measure and calculate the carbon footprint based on various data sources (e.g. consumer behaviour deducted from payment data, fuel consumption from data generated by our cars etc.). By measuring the footprint, the individual would be presented with an overview, which could then be broken down for further analysis by the tools provided within the service (e.g. are there any specific products I buy, that significantly increase my footprint and should I consider alternatives?). After analysing the root causes (yes this is inspired by the continuous improvement philosophy) of your footprint, you would then be able to define ways on how to improve. Lastly the control step would be something that could integrate some sort of reward structure, to make sure individuals are rewarded adequately for good behaviour.

&#x200B;

What would be the business model:

I'd say we make this available for individuals for free, but charge (monthly/yearly) licensing costs for corporate & government institutions that are forced to invest in incentives that combat climate change. Also, by providing an option to analyse demographic information on carbon footprints these institutions could define targets for improvement (e.g. we want each individual in our workforce to have a maximum footprint of x kg of CO2 / year, or, we want to reduce the carbon footprint of our overall society by x% by 2025).

&#x200B;

So what's next:

As you might have concluded from the above, I have little to zero experience in software engineering, algorithms, cryptography and whatsoever. But what I do have is a background in industrial engineering & strategy. I hope that I have triggered some of you with this rough conceptual idea, and that we can get in touch someway, as I hope to further investigate if (co-)developing something like this is possible, or if any other parties are already working on similar initiatives.

I have heard great stories of open source development, and maybe this is something that can be developed together by using online team environment such as Slack.

Personally I think this concept could impact the world for the better, but that it will be challenging to develop. Nevertheless I hope that I have sparked some interest and I'm looking forward to get in touch with anyone who has ideas on how to further think this through.",2018-12-28 13:28:35,1,0.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/aaab2d/idea_how_insight_in_my_own_carbon_footprint_could/,True,HqHu,1747904312.499653,carbon footprint,manual,reddit_posts_2018_12.csv,post,,,,2025-05-22 08:58:32.499653101,"I recently had a discussion with family members during our Christmas dinner regarding global warming and how each of us as individual (whether we want it or not) contributes to the whole issue.

cf7msp,collapse,skeptical,It is unfair. We will all die unhappy because 95% of the population is not aware of the collapse.,"Inspired by this beautiful [topic by /u/Sabina090705]( https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ceum0y/i_flaired_this_post_coping_because_to_me_its_not/) I decided to pitch in my 2 cents.

I do not live in the United States, I am 10 years younger than the above user (30 yo vs 40yo) and I am afraid. But not afraid of the collapse, or of an authoritarian US or of the ongoing destruction of the planet. I am scared by the simple fact of being unhappy until death comes for me. My whole life I was a pessimist, you know, the typical dude “better be safe than sorry” or “it’s better to be prepared for the worse and be happy when it turns out well”, but never was I so afraid. 

I come from an academic family that is very politic-centric, watches the news and reads whitepapers constantly. In the last 10 years, I finished 3 master degrees, learned 3 foreign languages and started a family. In comparison, you may say I’m well off, no debt, no illness and a pretty nice “social parachute”. But that’s all lies. Lies told by politicians how well we have, how we should be grateful and enjoy the meme/movies/eating out. How we will enjoy our retirement. But I know that we current state of affairs, everything I do, like savings, being a responsible buyer will be useless in 10 years. To be honest, the grey mass of uneducated/carpe diem people that live by maxing CC will be far better than I am. At least they are enjoying themselves now and I in the meantime I’m worrying for the future.

> First small digression: I lived in Poland for quite some time. The current polish govt is pro-nationalist, is destroying the rule of law left and right, is pro-catholic, doesn't care about the environment and is buying votes by having a ""great"" social plan. Just to show you how Poland is fucked, almost 50% of citizens between 18 and 65 are not working, there's 4M of Ukrainian migrants in Poland and with an average salary of 3000 PLN net (around 800 EUR) the govt. decides to give 500 PLN per child every month. [My gilded comment about the current situation in Poland](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cb3yfo/poland_to_eliminate_income_tax_for_all_workers/etdpac7/). How do you sustain such a country when 100% of your powergrid is dependent on Russian Oil and  on the import of power from Germany and Sweden? You just can't. There's no plan to build any wind farm, solar panel farm or nuclear plant. And for some amazing reason, the housing market in Poland exploded (it's impossible to buy a flat) and every one is somehow ""living the dream"".

When I still had friends, I tried to talk to them about climate changes. That half of all the CO2 emissions were done post 1990, that rising temperature will have a cascading effect on all the power plants and blackouts will be frequent. The equator belt will be hit by such a heat waves and a wetbulb event that the ensuing African, Indian or S.Am. migration will be the downfall of the US and EU. Already when traveling in Greece, Italy, France or Germany you see plenty of Africans in the streets not working and just “being there”. Now imagine this coupled with a blackout, water crisis and crop destruction. It is an apocalypse. 

> Second Small digression, Referring to the above post in the first paragraph – I totally agree that closing and guarding the border is not a solution. The isolationism coupled with nationalism policy never worked and always sparked devastating wars. But accepting everyone is also not wise, we should be helping the migrants by having a plan.

Anyway, there are not enough resources to build all the renewable electric powerplants and grid to sustain the current energy needs of the world. Moreover, China, India, and all the developing countries won’t be so eager to implement western ecological rules. Drinking water shortages will be a daily occurrence, revolts and rebellions will happen every day. Do you see what’s going on in France? They have a weekly yellow vest protest for the last 6 months just because Macron wanted to RAISE THE TAX ON FUEL.

That's 8M*4 (a typical family of 4)= 32M without anything to eat. That's almost 10% of the US.

On another note, my grandparents were Polish (Bless their souls), they witnessed WWII first hand. I can still hear the stories they would tell me when I was younger. Of the time when my grandma as a little girl had to run in a field with her whole village because the Stuka’s where strafing it. And then a year or two later, to hide in barns because Russians were raping whole villages. Or of my grandpa fighting in the Warsaw uprising on ’44 as a young boy. War is terrible and war brings the worst in us. That’s why, our grandparents, when they came home from this war or the following ones, were not preoccupied with the climate change. They wanted the best for them and their children by building a home, having a car, being able to travel. We can all understand it somehow that the terrors of war were so profound that CO2 – something you can’t even see – was not on their priority list. 

But when the Boomers went on a crazy spending spree they left us with nothing. The minimum wage in the US should be 4x higher to match the minimum wage of ’60. It is harder and harder to find work because of automation. The population of every country is getting older and older and fewer kids are born.

And my hard to swallow pill is the fact that everyone around me is happy and I’m not. Just because I know 10x more than them I will die unhappy and afraid. They live their life, they post on Instagram pictures from Tokyo or Maldives, they are building houses, buying new cars and spending, spending, spending. Some of them will watch and repost a Vox or Vice video about climate change and that’s it. It is far more important for them to watch the latest Stranger thing or to badmouth a colleague at work to get a promotion. I don't have a car, nor a house, nor spending thousands on holidays. I try to live responsibly but I see it is pointless.

We are living in a dystopia where the whole society is telling us “work, save, and at the ripe age of 65, you will retire and travel the world” or “Study STEM, work a lot and retire early at the age of 40 or 45”. But what if you won’t make it even until 45? What if there will be such a strong recession or war that everything you saved during your lifetime will be erased? What's the point of working or trying to be a better human or trying to learn a new craft if everything is pointless.

Please, I really would like to bank on the fact that I know (knowledge is power, isn't it?) what’s happening. How to make enough money now to be still able to enjoy the last years that we have on this earth? I would hate to die in a couple of years knowing that all my /dumb/ friends enjoyed life. I was the one saving but in the end we all died thanks to them and their peers spending.

PS: the sad part is that the general population is more and more “woke”, r/worldnews is almost a copy of r/collapse. More and more people are being conscious of what’s happening, but they are still hopeful that we can change the direction we are heading. If more people are conscious then the collapse will happen sooner than later. More people will start panicking, sparkling rebellions and revolutions. So the collapse maybe sooner than we think.

I do not live in the United States, I am 10 years younger than the above user (30 yo vs 40yo) and I am afraid. But not afraid of the collapse, or of an authoritarian US or of the ongoing destruction of the planet. I am scared by the simple fact of being unhappy until death comes for me. My whole life I was a pessimist, you know, the typical dude “better be safe than sorry” or “it’s better to be prepared for the worse and be happy when it turns out well”, but never was I so afraid. I come from an academic family that is very politic-centric, watches the news and reads whitepapers constantly. In the last 10 years, I finished 3 master degrees, learned 3 foreign languages and started a family. In comparison, you may say I’m well off, no debt, no illness and a pretty nice “social parachute”. But that’s all lies. Lies told by politicians how well we have, how we should be grateful and enjoy the meme/movies/eating out. How we will enjoy our retirement. But I know that we current state of affairs, everything I do, like savings, being a responsible buyer will be useless in 10 years.

The current polish govt is pro-nationalist, is destroying the rule of law left and right, is pro-catholic, doesn't care about the environment and is buying votes by having a ""great"" social plan. Just to show you how Poland is fucked, almost 50% of citizens between 18 and 65 are not working, there's 4M of Ukrainian migrants in Poland and with an average salary of 3000 PLN net (around 800 EUR) the govt. decides to give 500 PLN per child every month. and every one is somehow ""living the dream"". When I still had friends, I tried to talk to them about climate changes. That half of all the CO2 emissions were done post 1990, that rising temperature will have a cascading effect on all the power plants and blackouts will be frequent. The equator belt will be hit by such a heat waves and a wetbulb event that the ensuing African, Indian or S.Am. migration will be the downfall of the US and EU. Already when traveling in Greece, Italy, France or Germany you see plenty of Africans in the streets not working and just “being there”. Now imagine this coupled with a blackout, water crisis and crop destruction. It is an apocalypse. > Second Small digression, Referring to the above post in the first paragraph – I totally agree that closing and guarding the border is not a solution. The isolationism coupled with nationalism policy never worked and always sparked devastating wars. But accepting everyone is also not wise, we should be helping the migrants by having a plan. Anyway, there are not enough resources to build all the renewable electric powerplants and grid to sustain the current energy needs of the world. Moreover, China, India, and all the developing countries won’t be so eager to implement western ecological rules.

d22j881,conservation,scientific,,"I don't think you will find people on this sub saying that conservation isn't important. I suppose in different subreddits you may get different answers.

Before I answer, I would deconstruct a few assumptions you appear to make in your question:

First, I question the need to think of humans as separate from the rest of life on this planet. I understand why we're in the habit of doing this in our everyday lives, and for many issues it makes plenty of sense. For example, I'm generally sympathetic to animal welfare, but I would stop short of saying that chickens and humans deserve the same rights. But in a more broad sense, humans, and any other organism here, have the same rights to call this planet home and we all depend upon it for all our needs. We all evolved here and were shaped by natural processes here. So, I believe it helps us to think of humans as a part of our ecosystems, rather than just outside actors. This isn't meant to be some kind of hippie-dippie back-to-the-trees kumbaya nonsense, but to guard against thinking of ourselves as total outsiders to natural ecosystems and processes.

Second, and this ties into the previous issue, I would question the importance of conserving any specific species in a vacuum. It's difficult to guess the implications of any one species going extinct and how wild areas bounce back. Take the near extinction of American Chestnut for example. This was a sizeable component of eastern North American forests with hundreds of different animal species dependent on it for food, habitat, etc. Now it's pretty much gone, but the forests here rebounded with oaks and hickories replacing the chestnut. It's simply very hard to predict what happens in the event of an extinction (or near-extinction in this case). Perhaps we got lucky, but maybe we won't be in the future.

So my point is generally this: Conservation need to be broad. We have to do more than just save large charismatic animals, and instead conserve large swaths of land (and water) more-or-less intact (see E.O. Wilson's latest book for more on this) to stave off extinctions. This will, I hope, also be a tool in fighting climate change. Many models scientists have put together suggest that native ranges for many animals and plants will shift if climate shifts continue. If we have plenty of land in conservation than those habitat changes can occur -- animals will be able to migrate uninterrupted, seeds will find themselves landing in suitable habitat, etc -- if not, then we risk extirpation or extinction for these species as they fail to find new suitable habitat because they are isolated by human development and disturbance.

Conservation is also in our best interests. Humans depend far more on ecosystem services than the average person knows. We take crop pollination for granted, but a rough estimate of its value, just in the US, is around $29 billion per year (http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/05/insect-pollinators-contribute-29b-us-farm-income). You can add to that all sorts of other things wild areas do for us that have real economic benefits such as wetlands mitigating storm/flooding damage (estimated to be $13 billion in value per year in the US http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/intro/value/) , sand dunes retaining vulnerable soils near valuable real estate, beneficial insects living in refugia helping to reduce dependence on pesticides. Look at the landslides and dropping water tables in Haiti, which I've seen first-hand, as a result of rampant deforestation. Consider the value of ecosystems that we need to function in order to hunt or fish from them (According to FAO, total value of all fish caught in a year is over $200 billion). This is before even considering the economic benefits of tourism to neighboring communities, and intangible benefits of simply being able to enjoy natural areas.

Look closely at the list above though and you'll notice that many of those economic benefits of conservation aren't tied to any given species, but to the function of an entire ecosystem. And this gets back to your question about protecting individual species. In many cases we don't know which or how many species we can let go extinct from any given ecosystem before the whole thing starts to fall apart and we can't reap those benefits any more. Many of the ecologists I know and work with say that the concept of a ""keystone species"" may be an outdated view. That ecosystems don't necessarily depend on just a few vital actors with everyone else playing background roles, but that as more and more species get removed, we weaken the entire ecosystem. If these changes to abiotic factors and removal of living species happens too quickly, there may not be enough time for natural systems to adapt and continue the functions that we depend on. So even a an anthropocentric viewpoint leads us to conservation as a precautionary measure to make sure we can continue to exploit natural systems.

I won't argue that every species needs to be conserved. A number of people have argued in favor of letting pandas go extinct. I'm hardly an expert, but the arguments they make sound compelling. Chances are that a handful of remaining rhinos aren't ecologically significant (again I don't know, I'm speculating). But they serve as important mascots and if we protect them in situ, instead of or in addition to in zoos, then we are working to conserve a much broader array of species and the rhino serves as a valuable mascot.

To get slightly off track, there seems to be a real futurist bent on Reddit. Personally, I don't know if we're going to start colonizing other planets or not, but even if we do, that doesn't reduce the need to conserve, instead it amplifies it. If we want to, say, terraform Mars we're going to need plants and fungi to do it. And we're going to have to pick from the palette of organisms here on Earth to achieve that. If we've destroyed wild areas, and let many thousands more species go extinct then we have fewer options to work with and success will be more difficult. The point I made about humans not existing in a vacuum, but as part of a system of interdependence on other species will still be true too, it will just be a different set of species on which we depend upon. But I imagine, even if humans become some sci-fi galaxy conquering race, we'll still need to depend on services that other living organisms provide.

Sorry, that was a lot of words. I hope that helps though!

Humans depend on the environment for survival and it's in our best interest in a broad sense.**",2016-04-14 13:35:42,3,,,,,[deleted],1747862034.56313,our planet is dying,manual,reddit_comments_2016_04.csv,comment,t3_4eq4bn,4eq4bn,,2025-05-21 21:13:54.563129902,"I don't think you will find people on this sub saying that conservation isn't important.

Conservation is also in our best interests. Humans depend far more on ecosystem services than the average person knows. We take crop pollination for granted, but a rough estimate of its value, just in the US, is around $29 billion per year ( You can add to that all sorts of other things wild areas do for us that have real economic benefits such as wetlands mitigating storm/flooding damage (estimated to be $13 billion in value per year in the US , sand dunes retaining vulnerable soils near valuable real estate, beneficial insects living in refugia helping to reduce dependence on pesticides. Look at the landslides and dropping water tables in Haiti, which I've seen first-hand, as a result of rampant deforestation. Consider the value of ecosystems that we need to function in order to hunt or fish from them (According to FAO, total value of all fish caught in a year is over $200 billion). This is before even considering the economic benefits of tourism to neighboring communities, and intangible benefits of simply being able to enjoy natural areas. Look closely at the list above though and you'll notice that many of those economic benefits of conservation aren't tied to any given species, but to the function of an entire ecosystem. And this gets back to your question about protecting individual species. In many cases we don't know which or how many species we can let go extinct from any given ecosystem before the whole thing starts to fall apart and we can't reap those benefits any more. Many of the ecologists I know and work with say that the concept of a ""keystone species"" may be an outdated view. That ecosystems don't necessarily depend on just a few vital actors with everyone else playing background roles, but that as more and more species get removed, we weaken the entire ecosystem. If these changes to abiotic factors and removal of living species happens too quickly, there may not be enough time for natural systems to adapt and continue the functions that we depend on. So even a an anthropocentric viewpoint leads us to conservation as a precautionary measure to make sure we can continue to exploit natural systems. I won't argue that every species needs to be conserved. A number of people have argued in favor of letting pandas go extinct. I'm hardly an expert, but the arguments they make sound compelling. Chances are that a handful of remaining rhinos aren't ecologically significant (again I don't know, I'm speculating). But they serve as important mascots and if we protect them in situ, instead of or in addition to in zoos, then we are working to conserve a much broader array of species and the rhino serves as a valuable mascot. To get slightly off track, there seems to be a real futurist bent on Reddit. Personally, I don't know if we're going to start colonizing other planets or not, but even if we do, that doesn't reduce the need to conserve, instead it amplifies it. If we want to, say, terraform Mars we're going to need plants and fungi to do it. And we're going to have to pick from the palette of organisms here on Earth to achieve that. If we've destroyed wild areas, and let many thousands more species go extinct then we have fewer options to work with and success will be more difficult. The point I made about humans not existing in a vacuum, but as part of a system of interdependence on other species will still be true too, it will just be a different set of species on which we depend upon. But I imagine, even if humans become some sci-fi galaxy conquering race, we'll still need to depend on services that other living organisms provide. Sorry, that was a lot of words. I hope that helps though! **TLDR, Conservation is more than just keeping individual species alive. Humans depend on the environment for survival and it's in our best interest in a broad sense.**","[""n't"", 'think', 'find', 'people', 'sub', 'saying', 'conservation', ""n't"", 'important', 'suppose',

Energy Tokenization simplifies, standardizes, and opens worldwide  currently existing energy investment ecosystem. Hence, energy producers  can trade directly with the green energy buyers (investors and  consumers) and raise their capital by selling energy upfront, at lowest  market prices. Energy tokenization protects liquidity and extends access  to capital.

TerraGreen enables tokenization, the tokenized energy  represents a contracting mechanism among an energy producer and energy  consumer.

Energy tokens will be used as funding, investing, and  paying bills. When a token is generated by the energy producers, they  invest energy in it and hence they are known as energy tokens. These  energy tokens are used by consumers to pay bills to the utilities. And  furthermore, they can be converted into fiat currencies too if needed.  The users will be rewarded too.

The bills paid by consumers to the  utility as an energy token won’t be a token anymore the platform will  directly help in funding the renewable energy projects which will  develop and help the future of the planet earth and will make earth a  better place.

bh6mk8,sustainability,action-oriented,An Opinion on Electric Vehicles,"Transportation pollution is a significant contributor to humans ecological footprint, but we often sacrifice the effects to our ecosystems for the convenience and reliability of combustion vehicles. We are consistently searching for more ideal solutions to preserve our planet, but this presents a wicked problem. Electric vehicles are widely considered the future of sustainable personal travel, but the ecological hardships that come with producing and recycling lithium ion batteries make them far from ideal until new solutions to ease these hardships are brought to light. 

First I want to address the ecological obstacles that we have encountered in the production of lithium ion batteries and electric vehicles in general. Although these vehicles undoubtedly have less of a negative ecological impact than combustion-powered vehicles once on the road, when you factor in the energy used and emissions created by their production it can end up being the same or worse for the environment than regular vehicles. Jonathan Eckart of the World Economic Forum wrote that “electric vehicles can generate more carbon emissions over their lifecycle – from procurement of raw materials to manufacturing, use and recycling – than petrol or diesel cars” and stated that “producing an electric vehicle contributes, on average, twice as much to global warming potential and uses double the amount of energy than producing a combustion engine car. This is mainly because of its battery. Battery production uses a lot of energy, from the extraction of raw materials to the electricity consumed in manufacture” (Eckart, 2017). This brings to light a clear problem with making electric vehicles the future of transportation. I believe that until drastic changes are made in these production processes, we can’t settle for electric vehicles as our best option. 

Not only is the production of these batteries a problem, recycling and disposing of the materials that make up these batteries is economically and ecologically costly. The active chemicals in lithium ion batteries do not degrade naturally or can be reused easily after use, posing a major threat to groundwater and any ecosystem they are disposed of in. Often times when a battery is too used up to be reliable for transportation it still has enough power to be used for smaller tasks, but this is rarely done and the batteries are irresponsibly thrown away. The lithium in these batteries can be recycled for reuse in new batteries as well, but as of now the process isn’t cost effective and can’t provide any profit to those who choose to do it. Jonathan Eckart states that “To recycle a battery, it currently costs €1 per kg. But the value of raw material reclaimed is only a third of that. Recycling lithium costs five times as much as extracting virgin material” (Eckart, 2017). This shows that even though we have the technology to safely recycle these harmful materials, many companies won’t pursue it because it has no financial benefit. These vehicles are becoming more and more common as stated by Ashley Schmid, and as they become exponentially more common on the road we have to address these problems to make electric vehicles a truly viable option for sustainable personal transportation. 

Although there is a plethora of obstacles caused by the batteries in electric vehicles, they are the key to making these vehicles work and have made great progress in the last decade. According to Schmid, technology improvements in lithium-ion batteries due to trending popularity and progressive tax incentives have driven the cost of batteries in a Tesla Roadster from starting at “upwards of 900 dollars” in 2008 , where now “They now hold double the energy by weight and only cost 300 dollars per kilowatt-hour” (Schmid, 2017). There are solutions to these problems; the main one is making these batteries more financially realistic. Technology improvements make these batteries cheaper to produce and much more efficient in their use. We need to constantly push to make these batteries more affordable, common, and using less energy until they are even cheaper to make than combustion based vehicles. This speaks for battery recycling as well, as it becomes more financially beneficial many more companies will push to reuse lithium from recycled batteries. There are also alternatives as a solution that are consistently becoming more popular, such as cars powered by biofuels or solar power.

There are many obstacles that pose major threats to the future of electric vehicles and sustainable travel in general. The key for us as a human citizens is to be able to realistically recognize these obstacles, and instead of being satisfied with the improvements made we need to always push for the next technological advancement that makes these vehicles even better. Sustainability is about never being satisfied and always yearning to know more about the problems we face so we can better confront and solve them. No one solution will satisfy everybody which makes this such a wicked problem, but the first step to solving these problems is recognizing the issues with our current solution and tackling them on the way to finding truly sustainable personal travel.

bt8kn1,sustainability,action-oriented,"Unexpected new home build, looking to go NetZero [ON, Canada]","TL/DR: I have an insurance claim and it appears that my insurance company will be tearing down my house and giving me a settlement to rebuild. As an advocate for the environment and green energy I'm looking for ideas, concepts, or known practises to build a strong environmentally friendly house.

Timeframe of events: In 1987 there was a permit to raise the cottage to add a basement. This permit was never closed. In 1989 the owner of the house added a second story and a new roof without a permit. The basement is now a finished basement, where no permit was pulled as required, and finally this is now a 4 season house which also should have had a permit.

Known issues: The foundation is undersized for the building, the main floor is out of plumb and level, and the remaining work is structurally suspect. The building envelope is completely failing (14.7 air changes an our based on a blower door test)

With all of these issues the only real option appears to be demolishing and starting from scratch.
 
The constraints: We are on a very small property, 50'x125' adjacent to a Lake. We are on a sloping property so our basement is a walkout. The current footprint of the house is 30'x22' (w x d). We do not have the room for a septic & have poor water quality.

The proposed Solutions: 

The house is located close to several cement plants and quarries. I believe this makes a concrete house the most sustainable and strongest option. I am leaning towards a 100% ICF house including floors and a flat roof.

I would like a green roof so that I can take advantage of the views as well as reduced heating/ cooling costs. In addition the green roof will help reduce runoff to the lake.

I would like to add an array of 10 solar panels to a small sloped roof to generate between 1kW and 2.5kW, depending on the quality of panel I can afford. I would also like 2 small windmills, which should generate 800W combined.

I am thinking the best use of energy would be for me to run AC electrical for all standard receptacles and DC lines for all lighting.

For sewage I have looked into an Aerobic central composting toilet system which will essentially produce my fill for my lawn in the spring. I would also like to use a gray water re-use system, which can be used for lawn irrigation and car washing. (I can also use it for toilet flushing, but the toilets I have in mind use less that 1Liter per flush so that seems pointless to add into the plumbing.)

For water purification I am looking into nano-filtration, as I have hard water with high organics, iron, methane, sand, and high turbidity. This is why water Reuse is also so important. I am also considering copper plumbing for any drinking water sources and PEX for all others.

For cooling: I have been looking into mini split AC units. I have not looked into a suitable dehumidifier system yet.  I would like to also create a water jacket on the south facing walls to absorb solar heat before it gets into the house.

For Ventilation: I will need a heat recovery ventilator and would like to add a ground source air intake to help stabilize the new air introduced into the house.

For heating: I am thinking radiant heating is the best option due to the concrete floors. 

Other features: I am hoping to add a sunroom/ greenhouse as an air filter as well as humidifier in the winter. I want two kitchens, one designed for the heating season the other for cooling season.

I am years ahead of when I hoped I would be able to build a sustainable house. I am in a bit of a panic trying to confirm the concepts I have planned, intersystem integration as well as exhausting all research sources. (I typically start with academic journals, Canadian approvals, provincial approvals, and finally municipal requirements to ensure my designs are acceptable.)

As an advocate for the environment and green energy I'm looking for ideas, concepts, or known practises to build a strong environmentally friendly house. Timeframe of events: In 1987 there was a permit to raise the cottage to add a basement. This permit was never closed. In 1989 the owner of the house added a second story and a new roof without a permit. The basement is now a finished basement, where no permit was pulled as required, and finally this is now a 4 season house which also should have had a permit. Known issues: The foundation is undersized for the building, the main floor is out of plumb and level, and the remaining work is structurally suspect. The building envelope is completely failing (14.7 air changes an our based on a blower door test) With all of these issues the only real option appears to be demolishing and starting from scratch. The constraints: We are on a very small property, 50'x125' adjacent to a Lake. We are on a sloping property so our basement is a walkout. The current footprint of the house is 30'x22' (w x d). We do not have the room for a septic & have poor water quality. The proposed Solutions: The house is located close to several cement plants and quarries. I believe this makes a concrete house the most sustainable and strongest option. I am leaning towards a 100% ICF house including floors and a flat roof. I would like a green roof so that I can take advantage of the views as well as reduced heating/ cooling costs. In addition the green roof will help reduce runoff to the lake. I would like to add an array of 10 solar panels to a small sloped roof to generate between 1kW and 2.5kW, depending on the quality of panel I can afford. I would also like 2 small windmills, which should generate 800W combined. I am thinking the best use of energy would be for me to run AC electrical for all standard receptacles and DC lines for all lighting. For sewage I have looked into an Aerobic central composting toilet system which will essentially produce my fill for my lawn in the spring. I would also like to use a gray water re-use system, which can be used for lawn irrigation and car washing. (I can also use it for toilet flushing, but the toilets I have in mind use less that 1Liter per flush so that seems pointless to add into the plumbing.) For water purification I am looking into nano-filtration, as I have hard water with high organics, iron, methane, sand, and high turbidity. This is why water Reuse is also so important. I am also considering copper plumbing for any drinking water sources and PEX for all others. For cooling: I have been looking into mini split AC units. I have not looked into a suitable dehumidifier system yet. I would like to also create a water jacket on the south facing walls to absorb solar heat before it gets into the house. For Ventilation: I will need a heat recovery ventilator and would like to add a ground source air intake to help stabilize the new air introduced into the house. For heating: I am thinking radiant heating is the best option due to the concrete floors. Other features: I am hoping to add a sunroom/ greenhouse as an air filter as well as humidifier in the winter. I want two kitchens, one designed for the heating season the other for cooling season. I am years ahead of when I hoped I would be able to build a sustainable house. I am in a bit of a panic trying to confirm the concepts I have planned, intersystem integration as well as exhausting all research sources. (I typically start with academic journals, Canadian approvals, provincial approvals, and finally municipal requirements to ensure my designs are acceptable.) However it has taken me just over 1 year to find a toilet system and building structure. I am running out of time researching everything else. Has anyone here ever attempted a project of this size? Has anyone every used or heard of any one of these systems or techniques?","['tl/dr', 'insurance', 'claim', 'appears', 'insurance', 'company', 'tearing', 'house', 'giving', 'settlement', 'rebuild', 'advocate', 'environment', 'green', 'energy', 'looking', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'known', 'practises', 'build', 'strong', 'environmentally', 'friendly', 'house', 'timeframe', 'events', '1987', 'permit', 'raise', 'cottage', 'add', 'basement', 'permit', 'never', 'closed', '1989', 'owner', 'house', 'added', 'second', 'story', 'new', 'roof', 'without', 'permit', 'basement', 'finished', 'basement', 'permit', 'pulled', 'required', 'finally', 'season', 'house', 'also', 'permit', 'known', 'issues', 'foundation', 'undersized', 'building', 'main', 'floor', 'plumb', 'level', 'remaining', 'work', 'structurally', 'suspect', 'building', 'envelope', 'completely', 'failing', '14.7', 'air', 'changes', 'based', 'blower', 'door', 'test', 'issues', 'real', 'option', 'appears', 'demolishing', 'starting', 'scratch', 'constraints', 'small', 'property', ""50'x125"", 'adjacent', 'lake', 'sloping', 'property', 'basement', 'walkout', 'current', 'footprint', 'house', ""30'x22"", 'room', 'septic', 'poor', 'water', 'quality', 'proposed', 'solutions', 'house', 'located', 'close', 'several', 'cement', 'plants', 'quarries', 'believe', 'makes', 'concrete', 'house', 'sustainable', 'strongest', 'option', 'leaning', 'towards', '100', 'icf', 'house', 'including', 'floors', 'flat', 'roof', 'would', 'like', 'green', 'roof', 'take', 'advantage', 'views', 'well', 'reduced', 'heating/', 'cooling', 'costs', 'addition', 'green', 'roof', 'help', 'reduce', 'runoff', 'lake', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'array', 'solar', 'panels', 'small', 'sloped', 'roof', 'generate', '1kw', '2.5kw', 'depending', 'quality', 'panel', 'afford', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'small', 'windmills', 'generate', '800w', 'combined', 'thinking', 'best', 'use', 'energy', 'would', 'run', 'electrical', 'standard', 'receptacles', 'lines', 'lighting', 'sewage', 'looked', 'aerobic', 'central', 'composting', 'toilet', 'system', 'essentially', 'produce', 'fill', 'lawn', 'spring', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'use', 'gray', 'water', 're-use', 'system', 'used', 'lawn', 'irrigation', 'car', 'washing', 'also', 'use', 'toilet', 'flushing', 'toilets', 'mind', 'use', 'less', '1liter', 'per', 'flush', 'seems', 'pointless', 'add', 'plumbing', 'water', 'purification', 'looking', 'nano-filtration', 'hard', 'water', 'high', 'organics', 'iron', 'methane', 'sand', 'high', 'turbidity', 'water', 'reuse', 'also', 'important', 'also', 'considering', 'copper', 'plumbing', 'drinking', 'water', 'sources', 'pex', 'others', 'cooling', 'looking', 'mini', 'split', 'units', 'looked', 'suitable', 'dehumidifier', 'system', 'yet', 'would', 'like', 'also', 'create', 'water', 'jacket', 'south', 'facing', 'walls', 'absorb', 'solar', 'heat', 'gets', 'house', 'ventilation', 'need', 'heat', 'recovery', 'ventilator', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'ground', 'source', 'air', 'intake', 'help', 'stabilize', 'new', 'air', 'introduced', 'house', 'heating', 'thinking', 'radiant', 'heating', 'best', 'option', 'due', 'concrete', 'floors', 'features', 'hoping', 'add', 'sunroom/', 'greenhouse', 'air', 'filter', 'well', 'humidifier', 'winter', 'want', 'two', 'kitchens', 'one', 'designed', 'heating', 'season', 'cooling', 'season', 'years', 'ahead', 'hoped', 'would', 'able', 'build', 'sustainable', 'house', 'bit', 'panic', 'trying', 'confirm', 'concepts', 'planned', 'intersystem', 'integration', 'well', 'exhausting', 'research', 'sources', 'typically', 'start', 'academic', 'journals', 'canadian', 'approvals', 'provincial', 'approvals', 'finally', 'municipal', 'requirements', 'ensure', 'designs', 'acceptable', 'however', 'taken', 'year', 'find', 'toilet', 'system', 'building', 'structure', 'running', 'time', 'researching', 'everything', 'else', 'anyone', 'ever', 'attempted', 'project', 'size', 'anyone', 'every', 'used', 'heard', 'one', 'systems', 'techniques']","['environment', 'greenhouse']",2,4061,381
dghn2t,urbanplanning,unknown,Engineering Intentionally Terrible Transit: A Critique of Southeast Michigan’s 2020-2045 RTA proposal Pt. 1: How Bad is it?,"# Disclaimer:

*This is part one of a three part series analyzing a local transit proposal that is likely to hit ballot boxes next year in my local area. This entry looks at the past history of transit in Southeast Michigan and compares it to the scope and scale of the Southeast Michigan Regional Transit Authority’s proposed “2045 vision” plan. My next entry will deal with what improvements can be made in order to avoid defeat at the ballot box, and the final entry will concern what types of political reforms would need to happen in order to assure the speedy and efficient delivery of a world class regional transit system to the Detroit Metro Area, as well as theorize about the future development of cities in general.*

Comprehensive regional transit has been at the tip of every single person’s tongue in the Detroit Metro Area and Greater Southeast Michigan region for decades now, which makes perfect sense once you consider the fact that [a 2019 WalletHub study ranked Detroit and its surrounding areas as literally the worst place to own a car in the entire nation](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-to-drive-in/13964/) due to the absolutely insane cost of insurance, car maintenance, and the overall condition of transportation infrastructure in the state of Michigan (Fun Fact: our roads are so trash that, in 2018 we elected a governor whose main platform was literally just [“We need to fix the damn roads”](http://youtube.com/watch?v=mjVJ5XoYKEA) and added a threat of vowing to completely veto any budget passed by the state legislature that didn’t include any long-term road funding. This promise which, unsurprising to anyone who has a passing curiosity in state politics, [was waffled on immediately after she got into office](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/09/09/whitmer-breaks-pledge-to-fix-the-damn-roads-under-new-budget)).

There’s something interesting about our demoralizing current lack of transit though: it didn’t always use to be like this. At its height in 1910, Michigan possessed over nine thousand miles of freight and regional/commuter rail, which is enough rail mileage to build a rail route from Detroit to the northernmost city in Michigan’s lower peninsula (Mackinaw City) thirty five times or, a rail line from NYC’s Grand Central Terminal to Michigan Central Station eighteen times. For reference, these cities are about 252 and 484 miles apart from Detroit respectively, [here’s a timeline compiled by the Michigan Department of Transit documenting the rise and fall of Michigan’s railways](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdot/Michigan_Railroad_History_506899_7.pdf) read it. It’s eye opening. Even in decades of stagnation and decline in the seventies and eighties, it was possible to catch [commuter trains from downtown Detroit to Jackson, Michigan and through to Chicago to the west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Executive) and [from the Renaissance Center on Detroit’s riverfront up to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac in the north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEMTA_Commuter_Rail).

So, just how in the hell does a major American city and a heavily developed state/region  allow it’s public infrastructure to deteriorate as drastically as it did? If you want the short, snarky yet completely true left-urbanist answer: It was because of capitalism, aduhh. If you a longer, more “objective” answer (that still relates to capitalism, but phrased in a way that allows people who are fans of “market urbanism” to not get too worked up):[ it happened for all the same reasons that the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WORIrHpC8M), private companies that live and die by their ability to endlessly expand their profits and have a vested interest in maintaining/expanding their business models will always seek to co-opt and undermine public goods if they threaten to compete with or undermine those same profits and business interests. It was true in 1920, and if left unchanged by the public it will remain the truth into 2020.

So, you may be thinking this post is informative so far and all. But, how does all of this relate to a transit proposal? Simply put, as a lifelong resident of this region, when I look at this proposal, which at first glance seems like one of the most ambitious transit plans this region’s history, is not up to snuff once you dive deeper into the details of all of the aspects that make up this proposal, nor does it learn from the state’s past mistakes of allowing privatization to take root within public assets, and that isn’t even nearly half of it. The RTA’s projections of job opportunities and lifestyles for the region’s young people like myself are hilariously bleak. It makes absolutely no effort to address or confront the fast approaching climate crisis that has to be tackled immediately if we want future generations to enjoy life on the only habitable planet that Humans have ever known. The RTA focuses on “connecting existing population and job centers” rather than striving to build and maintain new ones like the rail+property model that has been successfully deployed in cities across Asia. etc. Did I mention that it’s literally a giveaway to car and “mobility” companies? Yeah, well it’s that too.

Let’s take a dive into the proposal to see what specifically is so bad about it (trust me, there’s a lot, but I only wanna cover the big issues for the time being) [here’s a direct link to the proposal so you can read it and judge it’s merits for yourselves](http://www.rtamichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/8-2020.Mobility.Vision.Presentation.7.18.19.pdf)

# Bright predictions for a bullshit future

On the portion of the document that’s titled “The Region Today”, the RTA’s projections of population and job growth is a bit… iffy to say the least. Assuming that this transit plan is passed by voters next year, the RTA projects that the largest metro area in the state of Michigan will grow from 4.2 million to 4.5 million people, and the job market will grow from 2.5 million to 2.7 million jobs over the span of twenty years (2020-2045). If you extrapolate those figures to yearly growth percentages, they’re expecting a change of .012%/year and .008%/year respectively… If those figures don’t concern you, then I’d like to direct your attention to the bottom of the page where the RTA constructed a chart comparing the composition of the region’s population in 2015 to the projected composition of the region in 2045. If you want a lesson in how you can hide extremely unfavorable data in plain sight, look no further than this chart. While the senior population is projected to rise by a “mere” 7% and the youth population is projected to decline “only” 2% if you extrapolate this data to actual population figures, the estimated shift is absolutely jaw dropping: The senior population is expected to rise by 990,000 people while the youth population is expected to drop by 84,000 people.. To put that youth figure into proper context, [between the years of 2008 and 2012 the entire state of Michigan lost 17,208 young people with bachelor’s degrees per year](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2019/03/michigan-still-fights-brain-drain-although-outlook-has-improved.html), that 84k loss figure for the Detroit area is 22% larger than the losses for those four years combined.. Keep in mind that these are likely the “most optimistic” numbers that the RTA are projecting. Michigan has been a struggling state for a long time.

# A lack of care for the climate

The word “electric” is only used twice within a twenty eight page document describing a major municipal transit proposal, and only used when referring to the “aspirational goals”.... That’s a major problem. [The vast majority of climate scientists agree that if action isn’t taken within 12-11 years,  Earth will experience irreversible warming the likes of which this planet has never seen](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/27082019/12-years-climate-change-explained-ipcc-science-solutions). The fact that there aren’t any aggressive goals or benchmarks in place to meet tackle an issue of monumental importance like climate change, (refusing even to reference the words “climate change” a single time in the whole document no less) and the blatant admission on “The Region Today” page at the beginning of the document that the transit proposal does not aim to reduce overall car usage in the DMA, or increase the total percentage of low car and car-free households over the twenty five year lifespan of this proposal should put doubts in anyone’s minds that the RTA takes its job as a provider of public transit seriously.

# Artificially restricted and rickety rail numbers

The main backbone of the concrete promises in this transit proposal rely heavily on expanded local bus services, the promise of BRT lines on the region’s major thoroughfares, and just one commuter rail line.. that’s it. [Extensive research has already been done about the social and physical benefits that people may enjoy by simply living near rail transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cjfTG8DbwA&t=72s). The RTA might have included a few more commuter rail lines, light rail to the airport, and a promise to expand the Qline (A public-private financed streetcar that runs through downtown Detroit which was constructed with the unwanted influence of the state’s richest man Dan Gilbert, which is why the streetcar is named after his company Quicken Loans. [He oversaw a series of boneheaded design changes that lead the streetcar to drastically underperform it’s projected ridership projections](https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/two-years-in-detroits-qline-falls-far-short-of-expectations/Content?oid=21552552)) in their “aspirational goals” but like a lot of things in this proposal, upon a closer look, the numbers just don’t seem to add up. In the “Rail” portion of the document, the RTA states that $135 million dollars is needed in order to establish the Ann Arbor-Detroit commuter rail line, but, when the RTA calculates the cost of expanding the commuter rail  north to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac and northwest to the suburb of Mount Clements, *plus* building a new streetcar line to the airport, *plus* an unspecified expansion of the Qline downtown, they estimate the cost to only be $181 million dollar more per year… what? That‘s the type of math that I do when I don’t feel like working on an assignment until I find myself awake at 11:00 pm with a 12 o’clock deadline to turn in a paper to my professor.. It makes no sense.

#Finally: Crazy cash for car and mobility companies

References to explicit privatization of formerly public transit services and “public private partnerships” are peppered through this document more vigorously than a Cajun gumbo dish. Knowing the history of transit in this city and state as well as I do, I am more than a little freaked out when I see passages like: *“the evaluation of underperforming routes regularly and pilot alternative forms of mobility (i.e. microtransit, public private partnerships service models, etc.) is an aspirational goal of ours”* and *“Expanding public/private pilot programs to evaluate new service models is something that we want to do in the near term”* (which can be found in the “local bus”  and “new mobility services” portions of the document respectively) take up prime real estate on a document regarding a long term transit proposal. If you want to deal with solid numbers, if you add up all of the near term/long term goals where some form of privatization or public-private partnerships are mentioned, for profit companies would have access to $1.31 billion public dollars by the proposal’s end in 2045 (this amounts to $52.4 million/year).

If that isn’t unpalletable enough, there’s ample evidence here that there were some closed door deals made between public and private officials. Take Michigan Central Station (MCS), which is Ford’s new Corktown campus, it makes a not-so-strange cameo appearance in this plan. [It was announced on June 11th of last year that they bought the long abandoned landmark from a local family of notorious slumlords named the Moroun’s](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2018/06/11/moroun-detroit-train-station-ford/689841002/), who then proceeded to wax poetic about Ford’s “commitment to the future of Detroit” and all that PR fluff. Then, [a story broke on April 3rd of this year suggesting that representatives from Ford Co. approached members of Detroit/Wayne county’s port authority, officials in the Detroit mayor’s office, Congresswoman Brenda Jones of Southfield, and “other regional and transit officials” asking them to conduct a feasibility study to see if passenger rail service could be restored at the site](https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/detroit-studies-restoring-passenger-trains-michigan-central-station). Now, it might seem like a completely innocent, altruistic act for Ford to do at first glance. Detroit and southeast Michigan haven’t had a true regional rail network since the early eighties. But, once you consider the fact that, after the process of buying MCS was all said and done, [Ford secured $104 million dollars in tax breaks from Detroit](http://freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/10/16/ford-michigan-central-station-tax/1651079002/), which is America’s largest impoverished city population and percentage wise and [got a further $207 million from the state of Michigan](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/john-gallagher/2018/11/27/detroit-train-station-ford-corktown/2127091002/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) which has been experiencing a cataclysmic teacher shortage in its urban and rural schools (which won’t be helped by the fact that there are stipulations in these tax breaks that allow Ford to have the value of their property frozen to “pre-improvement” levels for 12-15 years, and they are exempted from paying city property, corporate, and utility taxes for 30 years. To put this into context, I was born in 1997, I’ll be 53 years old by the time Ford is legally obligated to pay the full cost of their new property). Nevermind the fact that, literally a couple months after the deal was finalized,[ they laid off 800 local workers for “reorgination purposes”](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/05/20/state-taxpayers-gave-ford-240m-then-it-cut-800-local-jobs) ,  [they owed the federal government $78 million in unpaid taxes as of last year](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/02/28/gm-ford-rarely-pay-federal-taxes-tax-refunds/2985737002/), and even though they moved  into Corktown in a completely transparent bid to try and capitalize off yet to be discussed transit proposal as well as flex their muscles as a “mobility company”, [Ford discontinued their “Chariot” services that they piloted in major metro areas like New York and San Francisco in order to show investors that they could even be a “mobility company”](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/ford-is-shutting-down-chariot-shuttle-service/)... there’s a whole portion of the transit proposal dedicated to this type of business model, and local “leaders” in the area thought that it was a good idea to do this..

[He oversaw a series of boneheaded design changes that lead the streetcar to drastically underperform it’s projected ridership projections]( in their “aspirational goals” but like a lot of things in this proposal, upon a closer look, the numbers just don’t seem to add up. In the “Rail” portion of the document, the RTA states that $135 million dollars is needed in order to establish the Ann Arbor-Detroit commuter rail line, but, when the RTA calculates the cost of expanding the commuter rail north to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac and northwest to the suburb of Mount Clements, *plus* building a new streetcar line to the airport, *plus* an unspecified expansion of the Qline downtown, they estimate the cost to only be $181 million dollar more per year… what? That‘s the type of math that I do when I don’t feel like working on an assignment until I find myself awake at 11:00 pm with a 12 o’clock deadline to turn in a paper to my professor.. It makes no sense. #Finally: Crazy cash for car and mobility companies References to explicit privatization of formerly public transit services and “public private partnerships” are peppered through this document more vigorously than a Cajun gumbo dish. Knowing the history of transit in this city and state as well as I do, I am more than a little freaked out when I see passages like: *“the evaluation of underperforming routes regularly and pilot alternative forms of mobility (i.e. microtransit, public private partnerships service models, etc.) is an aspirational goal of ours”* and *“Expanding public/private pilot programs to evaluate new service models is something that we want to do in the near term”* (which can be found in the “local bus” and “new mobility services” portions of the document respectively) take up prime real estate on a document regarding a long term transit proposal. If you want to deal with solid numbers, if you add up all of the near term/long term goals where some form of privatization or public-private partnerships are mentioned, for profit companies would have access to $1.31 billion public dollars by the proposal’s end in 2045 (this amounts to $52.4 million/year). If that isn’t unpalletable enough, there’s ample evidence here that there were some closed door deals made between public and private officials. Take Michigan Central Station (MCS), which is Ford’s new Corktown campus, it makes a not-so-strange cameo appearance in this plan. . Nevermind the fact that, literally a couple months after the deal was finalized,[ they laid off 800 local workers for “reorgination purposes”]( , [they owed the federal government $78 million in unpaid taxes as of last year]( and even though they moved into Corktown in a completely transparent bid to try and capitalize off yet to be discussed transit proposal as well as flex their muscles as a “mobility company”, [Ford discontinued their “Chariot” services that they piloted in major metro areas like New York and San Francisco in order to show investors that they could even be a “mobility company”]( there’s a whole portion of the transit proposal dedicated to this type of business model, and local “leaders” in the area thought that it was a good idea to do this.. You can’t make this shit up.","['disclaimer', 'part', 'one', 'three', 'part', 'series', 'analyzing', 'local', 'transit', 'proposal', 'likely', 'hit', 'ballot', 'boxes', 'next', 'year', 'local',

dghn2t,urbanplanning,unknown,Engineering Intentionally Terrible Transit: A Critique of Southeast Michigan’s 2020-2045 RTA proposal Pt. 1: How Bad is it?,"# Disclaimer:

*This is part one of a three part series analyzing a local transit proposal that is likely to hit ballot boxes next year in my local area. This entry looks at the past history of transit in Southeast Michigan and compares it to the scope and scale of the Southeast Michigan Regional Transit Authority’s proposed “2045 vision” plan. My next entry will deal with what improvements can be made in order to avoid defeat at the ballot box, and the final entry will concern what types of political reforms would need to happen in order to assure the speedy and efficient delivery of a world class regional transit system to the Detroit Metro Area, as well as theorize about the future development of cities in general.*

Comprehensive regional transit has been at the tip of every single person’s tongue in the Detroit Metro Area and Greater Southeast Michigan region for decades now, which makes perfect sense once you consider the fact that [a 2019 WalletHub study ranked Detroit and its surrounding areas as literally the worst place to own a car in the entire nation](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-to-drive-in/13964/) due to the absolutely insane cost of insurance, car maintenance, and the overall condition of transportation infrastructure in the state of Michigan (Fun Fact: our roads are so trash that, in 2018 we elected a governor whose main platform was literally just [“We need to fix the damn roads”](http://youtube.com/watch?v=mjVJ5XoYKEA) and added a threat of vowing to completely veto any budget passed by the state legislature that didn’t include any long-term road funding. This promise which, unsurprising to anyone who has a passing curiosity in state politics, [was waffled on immediately after she got into office](https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/09/09/whitmer-breaks-pledge-to-fix-the-damn-roads-under-new-budget)).

There’s something interesting about our demoralizing current lack of transit though: it didn’t always use to be like this. At its height in 1910, Michigan possessed over nine thousand miles of freight and regional/commuter rail, which is enough rail mileage to build a rail route from Detroit to the northernmost city in Michigan’s lower peninsula (Mackinaw City) thirty five times or, a rail line from NYC’s Grand Central Terminal to Michigan Central Station eighteen times. For reference, these cities are about 252 and 484 miles apart from Detroit respectively, [here’s a timeline compiled by the Michigan Department of Transit documenting the rise and fall of Michigan’s railways](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdot/Michigan_Railroad_History_506899_7.pdf) read it. It’s eye opening. Even in decades of stagnation and decline in the seventies and eighties, it was possible to catch [commuter trains from downtown Detroit to Jackson, Michigan and through to Chicago to the west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Executive) and [from the Renaissance Center on Detroit’s riverfront up to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac in the north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEMTA_Commuter_Rail).

So, just how in the hell does a major American city and a heavily developed state/region  allow it’s public infrastructure to deteriorate as drastically as it did? If you want the short, snarky yet completely true left-urbanist answer: It was because of capitalism, aduhh. If you a longer, more “objective” answer (that still relates to capitalism, but phrased in a way that allows people who are fans of “market urbanism” to not get too worked up):[ it happened for all the same reasons that the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WORIrHpC8M), private companies that live and die by their ability to endlessly expand their profits and have a vested interest in maintaining/expanding their business models will always seek to co-opt and undermine public goods if they threaten to compete with or undermine those same profits and business interests. It was true in 1920, and if left unchanged by the public it will remain the truth into 2020.

So, you may be thinking this post is informative so far and all. But, how does all of this relate to a transit proposal? Simply put, as a lifelong resident of this region, when I look at this proposal, which at first glance seems like one of the most ambitious transit plans this region’s history, is not up to snuff once you dive deeper into the details of all of the aspects that make up this proposal, nor does it learn from the state’s past mistakes of allowing privatization to take root within public assets, and that isn’t even nearly half of it. The RTA’s projections of job opportunities and lifestyles for the region’s young people like myself are hilariously bleak. It makes absolutely no effort to address or confront the fast approaching climate crisis that has to be tackled immediately if we want future generations to enjoy life on the only habitable planet that Humans have ever known. The RTA focuses on “connecting existing population and job centers” rather than striving to build and maintain new ones like the rail+property model that has been successfully deployed in cities across Asia. etc. Did I mention that it’s literally a giveaway to car and “mobility” companies? Yeah, well it’s that too.

Let’s take a dive into the proposal to see what specifically is so bad about it (trust me, there’s a lot, but I only wanna cover the big issues for the time being) [here’s a direct link to the proposal so you can read it and judge it’s merits for yourselves](http://www.rtamichigan.org/wp-content/uploads/8-2020.Mobility.Vision.Presentation.7.18.19.pdf)

# Bright predictions for a bullshit future

On the portion of the document that’s titled “The Region Today”, the RTA’s projections of population and job growth is a bit… iffy to say the least. Assuming that this transit plan is passed by voters next year, the RTA projects that the largest metro area in the state of Michigan will grow from 4.2 million to 4.5 million people, and the job market will grow from 2.5 million to 2.7 million jobs over the span of twenty years (2020-2045). If you extrapolate those figures to yearly growth percentages, they’re expecting a change of .012%/year and .008%/year respectively… If those figures don’t concern you, then I’d like to direct your attention to the bottom of the page where the RTA constructed a chart comparing the composition of the region’s population in 2015 to the projected composition of the region in 2045. If you want a lesson in how you can hide extremely unfavorable data in plain sight, look no further than this chart. While the senior population is projected to rise by a “mere” 7% and the youth population is projected to decline “only” 2% if you extrapolate this data to actual population figures, the estimated shift is absolutely jaw dropping: The senior population is expected to rise by 990,000 people while the youth population is expected to drop by 84,000 people.. To put that youth figure into proper context, [between the years of 2008 and 2012 the entire state of Michigan lost 17,208 young people with bachelor’s degrees per year](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2019/03/michigan-still-fights-brain-drain-although-outlook-has-improved.html), that 84k loss figure for the Detroit area is 22% larger than the losses for those four years combined.. Keep in mind that these are likely the “most optimistic” numbers that the RTA are projecting. Michigan has been a struggling state for a long time.

# A lack of care for the climate

The word “electric” is only used twice within a twenty eight page document describing a major municipal transit proposal, and only used when referring to the “aspirational goals”.... That’s a major problem. [The vast majority of climate scientists agree that if action isn’t taken within 12-11 years,  Earth will experience irreversible warming the likes of which this planet has never seen](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/27082019/12-years-climate-change-explained-ipcc-science-solutions). The fact that there aren’t any aggressive goals or benchmarks in place to meet tackle an issue of monumental importance like climate change, (refusing even to reference the words “climate change” a single time in the whole document no less) and the blatant admission on “The Region Today” page at the beginning of the document that the transit proposal does not aim to reduce overall car usage in the DMA, or increase the total percentage of low car and car-free households over the twenty five year lifespan of this proposal should put doubts in anyone’s minds that the RTA takes its job as a provider of public transit seriously.

# Artificially restricted and rickety rail numbers

The main backbone of the concrete promises in this transit proposal rely heavily on expanded local bus services, the promise of BRT lines on the region’s major thoroughfares, and just one commuter rail line.. that’s it. [Extensive research has already been done about the social and physical benefits that people may enjoy by simply living near rail transit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cjfTG8DbwA&t=72s). The RTA might have included a few more commuter rail lines, light rail to the airport, and a promise to expand the Qline (A public-private financed streetcar that runs through downtown Detroit which was constructed with the unwanted influence of the state’s richest man Dan Gilbert, which is why the streetcar is named after his company Quicken Loans. [He oversaw a series of boneheaded design changes that lead the streetcar to drastically underperform it’s projected ridership projections](https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/two-years-in-detroits-qline-falls-far-short-of-expectations/Content?oid=21552552)) in their “aspirational goals” but like a lot of things in this proposal, upon a closer look, the numbers just don’t seem to add up. In the “Rail” portion of the document, the RTA states that $135 million dollars is needed in order to establish the Ann Arbor-Detroit commuter rail line, but, when the RTA calculates the cost of expanding the commuter rail  north to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac and northwest to the suburb of Mount Clements, *plus* building a new streetcar line to the airport, *plus* an unspecified expansion of the Qline downtown, they estimate the cost to only be $181 million dollar more per year… what? That‘s the type of math that I do when I don’t feel like working on an assignment until I find myself awake at 11:00 pm with a 12 o’clock deadline to turn in a paper to my professor.. It makes no sense.

#Finally: Crazy cash for car and mobility companies

References to explicit privatization of formerly public transit services and “public private partnerships” are peppered through this document more vigorously than a Cajun gumbo dish. Knowing the history of transit in this city and state as well as I do, I am more than a little freaked out when I see passages like: *“the evaluation of underperforming routes regularly and pilot alternative forms of mobility (i.e. microtransit, public private partnerships service models, etc.) is an aspirational goal of ours”* and *“Expanding public/private pilot programs to evaluate new service models is something that we want to do in the near term”* (which can be found in the “local bus”  and “new mobility services” portions of the document respectively) take up prime real estate on a document regarding a long term transit proposal. If you want to deal with solid numbers, if you add up all of the near term/long term goals where some form of privatization or public-private partnerships are mentioned, for profit companies would have access to $1.31 billion public dollars by the proposal’s end in 2045 (this amounts to $52.4 million/year).

If that isn’t unpalletable enough, there’s ample evidence here that there were some closed door deals made between public and private officials. Take Michigan Central Station (MCS), which is Ford’s new Corktown campus, it makes a not-so-strange cameo appearance in this plan. [It was announced on June 11th of last year that they bought the long abandoned landmark from a local family of notorious slumlords named the Moroun’s](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2018/06/11/moroun-detroit-train-station-ford/689841002/), who then proceeded to wax poetic about Ford’s “commitment to the future of Detroit” and all that PR fluff. Then, [a story broke on April 3rd of this year suggesting that representatives from Ford Co. approached members of Detroit/Wayne county’s port authority, officials in the Detroit mayor’s office, Congresswoman Brenda Jones of Southfield, and “other regional and transit officials” asking them to conduct a feasibility study to see if passenger rail service could be restored at the site](https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/detroit-studies-restoring-passenger-trains-michigan-central-station). Now, it might seem like a completely innocent, altruistic act for Ford to do at first glance. Detroit and southeast Michigan haven’t had a true regional rail network since the early eighties. But, once you consider the fact that, after the process of buying MCS was all said and done, [Ford secured $104 million dollars in tax breaks from Detroit](http://freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/10/16/ford-michigan-central-station-tax/1651079002/), which is America’s largest impoverished city population and percentage wise and [got a further $207 million from the state of Michigan](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/john-gallagher/2018/11/27/detroit-train-station-ford-corktown/2127091002/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) which has been experiencing a cataclysmic teacher shortage in its urban and rural schools (which won’t be helped by the fact that there are stipulations in these tax breaks that allow Ford to have the value of their property frozen to “pre-improvement” levels for 12-15 years, and they are exempted from paying city property, corporate, and utility taxes for 30 years. To put this into context, I was born in 1997, I’ll be 53 years old by the time Ford is legally obligated to pay the full cost of their new property).

This entry looks at the past history of transit in Southeast Michigan and compares it to the scope and scale of the Southeast Michigan Regional Transit Authority’s proposed “2045 vision” plan. My next entry will deal with what improvements can be made in order to avoid defeat at the ballot box, and the final entry will concern what types of political reforms would need to happen in order to assure the speedy and efficient delivery of a world class regional transit system to the Detroit Metro Area, as well as theorize about the future development of cities in general.* Comprehensive regional transit has been at the tip of every single person’s tongue in the Detroit Metro Area and Greater Southeast Michigan region for decades now, which makes perfect sense once you consider the fact that [a 2019 WalletHub study ranked Detroit and its surrounding areas as literally the worst place to own a car in the entire nation]( due to the absolutely insane cost of insurance, car maintenance, and the overall condition of transportation infrastructure in the state of Michigan (Fun Fact: our roads are so trash that, in 2018 we elected a governor whose main platform was literally just [“We need to fix the damn roads”]( and added a threat of vowing to completely veto any budget passed by the state legislature that didn’t include any long-term road funding. This promise which, unsurprising to anyone who has a passing curiosity in state politics, [was waffled on immediately after she got into office]( There’s something interesting about our demoralizing current lack of transit though: it didn’t always use to be like this. At its height in 1910, Michigan possessed over nine thousand miles of freight and regional/commuter rail, which is enough rail mileage to build a rail route from Detroit to the northernmost city in Michigan’s lower peninsula (Mackinaw City) thirty five times or, a rail line from NYC’s Grand Central Terminal to Michigan Central Station eighteen times. For reference, these cities are about 252 and 484 miles apart from Detroit respectively, [here’s a timeline compiled by the Michigan Department of Transit documenting the rise and fall of Michigan’s railways]( read it. It’s eye opening. Even in decades of stagnation and decline in the seventies and eighties, it was possible to catch [commuter trains from downtown Detroit to Jackson, Michigan and through to Chicago to the west]( and [from the Renaissance Center on Detroit’s riverfront up to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac in the north]( So, just how in the hell does a major American city and a heavily developed state/region allow it’s public infrastructure to deteriorate as drastically as it did? If you want the short, snarky yet completely true left-urbanist answer: It was because of capitalism, aduhh. If you a longer, more “objective” answer (that still relates to capitalism, but phrased in a way that allows people who are fans of “market urbanism” to not get too worked up):[ it happened for all the same reasons that the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy happened]( private companies that live and die by their ability to endlessly expand their profits and have a vested interest in maintaining/expanding their business models will always seek to co-opt and undermine public goods if they threaten to compete with or undermine those same profits and business interests. It was true in 1920, and if left unchanged by the public it will remain the truth into 2020. So, you may be thinking this post is informative so far and all. But, how does all of this relate to a transit proposal? Simply put, as a lifelong resident of this region, when I look at this proposal, which at first glance seems like one of the most ambitious transit plans this region’s history, is not up to snuff once you dive deeper into the details of all of the aspects that make up this proposal, nor does it learn from the state’s past mistakes of allowing privatization to take root within public assets, and that isn’t even nearly half of it. The RTA’s projections of job opportunities and lifestyles for the region’s young people like myself are hilariously bleak. It makes absolutely no effort to address or confront the fast approaching climate crisis that has to be tackled immediately if we want future generations to enjoy life on the only habitable planet that Humans have ever known. The RTA focuses on “connecting existing population and job centers” rather than striving to build and maintain new ones like the rail+property model that has been successfully deployed in cities across Asia. etc. Did I mention that it’s literally a giveaway to car and “mobility” companies? Yeah, well it’s that too. Let’s take a dive into the proposal to see what specifically is so bad about it (trust me, there’s a lot, but I only wanna cover the big issues for the time being) [here’s a direct link to the proposal so you can read it and judge it’s merits for yourselves]( # Bright predictions for a bullshit future On the portion of the document that’s titled “The Region Today”, the RTA’s projections of population and job growth is a bit… iffy to say the least. Assuming that this transit plan is passed by voters next year, the RTA projects that the largest metro area in the state of Michigan will grow from 4.2 million to 4.5 million people, and the job market will grow from 2.5 million to 2.7 million jobs over the span of twenty years (2020-2045). If you extrapolate those figures to yearly growth percentages, they’re expecting a change of .012%/year and .008%/year respectively… If those figures don’t concern you, then I’d like to direct your attention to the bottom of the page where the RTA constructed a chart comparing the composition of the region’s population in 2015 to the projected composition of the region in 2045. If you want a lesson in how you can hide extremely unfavorable data in plain sight, look no further than this chart. While the senior population is projected to rise by a “mere” 7% and the youth population is projected to decline “only” 2% if you extrapolate this data to actual population figures, the estimated shift is absolutely jaw dropping: The senior population is expected to rise by 990,000 people while the youth population is expected to drop by 84,000 people.. To put that youth figure into proper context, [between the years of 2008 and 2012 the entire state of Michigan lost 17,208 young people with bachelor’s degrees per year]( that 84k loss figure for the Detroit area is 22% larger than the losses for those four years combined.. Keep in mind that these are likely the “most optimistic” numbers that the RTA are projecting. Michigan has been a struggling state for a long time. # A lack of care for the climate The word “electric” is only used twice within a twenty eight page document describing a major municipal transit proposal, and only used when referring to the “aspirational goals”.... That’s a major problem. and the blatant admission on “The Region Today” page at the beginning of the document that the transit proposal does not aim to reduce overall car usage in the DMA, or increase the total percentage of low car and car-free households over the twenty five year lifespan of this proposal should put doubts in anyone’s minds that the RTA takes its job as a provider of public transit seriously. # Artificially restricted and rickety rail numbers The main backbone of the concrete promises in this transit proposal rely heavily on expanded local bus services, the promise of BRT lines on the region’s major thoroughfares, and just one commuter rail line.. that’s it. [Extensive research has already been done about the social and physical benefits that people may enjoy by simply living near rail transit]( The RTA might have included a few more commuter rail lines, light rail to the airport, and a promise to expand the Qline (A public-private financed streetcar that runs through downtown Detroit which was constructed with the unwanted influence of the state’s richest man Dan Gilbert, which is why the streetcar is named after his company Quicken Loans. [He oversaw a series of boneheaded design changes that lead the streetcar to drastically underperform it’s projected ridership projections]( in their “aspirational goals” but like a lot of things in this proposal, upon a closer look, the numbers just don’t seem to add up. In the “Rail” portion of the document, the RTA states that $135 million dollars is needed in order to establish the Ann Arbor-Detroit commuter rail line, but, when the RTA calculates the cost of expanding the commuter rail north to the streetcar suburb of Pontiac and northwest to the suburb of Mount Clements, *plus* building a new streetcar line to the airport, *plus* an unspecified expansion of the Qline downtown, they estimate the cost to only be $181 million dollar more per year… what? That‘s the type of math that I do when I don’t feel like working on an assignment until I find myself awake at 11:00 pm with a 12 o’clock deadline to turn in a paper to my professor.. It makes no sense. #Finally: Crazy cash for car and mobility companies References to explicit privatization of formerly public transit services and “public private partnerships” are peppered through this document more vigorously than a Cajun gumbo dish. Knowing the history of transit in this city and state as well as I do, I am more than a little freaked out when I see passages like: *“the evaluation of underperforming routes regularly and pilot alternative forms of mobility (i.e. microtransit, public private partnerships service models, etc.) is an aspirational goal of ours”* and *“Expanding public/private pilot programs to evaluate new service models is something that we want to do in the near term”* (which can be found in the “local bus” and “new mobility services” portions of the document respectively) take up prime real estate on a document regarding a long term transit proposal. If you want to deal with solid numbers, if you add up all of the near term/long term goals where some form of privatization or public-private partnerships are mentioned, for profit companies would have access to $1.31 billion public dollars by the proposal’s end in 2045 (this amounts to $52.4 million/year). If that isn’t unpalletable enough, there’s ample evidence here that there were some closed door deals made between public and private officials. Take Michigan Central Station (MCS), which is Ford’s new Corktown campus, it makes a not-so-strange cameo appearance in this plan. . Nevermind the fact that, literally a couple months after the deal was finalized,[ they laid off 800 local workers for “reorgination purposes”]( , [they owed the federal government $78 million in unpaid taxes as of last year]( and even though they moved into Corktown in a completely transparent bid to try and capitalize off yet to be discussed transit proposal as well as flex their muscles as a “mobility company”, [Ford discontinued their “Chariot” services that they piloted in major metro areas like New York and San Francisco in order to show investors that they could even be a “mobility company”]( there’s a whole portion of the transit proposal dedicated to this type of business model, and local “leaders” in the area thought that it was a good idea to do this..

6f1w0g,vegan,unknown,"Veganism saved my life, or at the very least, dramatically improved the quality of my life and health.","(This is my personal account of living with a bizarre condition with disturbing symptoms. Might be TMI at some parts, so if blood and the like freaks you out, you might want to skip it.)

4 years ago, I laid down to go to sleep on night and felt like I was drowning in the blood I randomly started coughing up. It was the most terrifying moment of my life. I could barely breathe. I thought I was dying of a pulmonary embolism, or that I had cancer or some other devastating illness I had never heard of. 

I was rushed to the ER and was stabbed, poked, prodded, scanned, x-rayed, etc, and was told I was perfectly fine and ""sometimes weird things just happen and it shouldn't happen again"" and was sent on my way. Except it did happen again, for around 50 months straight, linking up perfectly with my menstrual cycles. 

For the first couple of years, I would only cough up blood on the worst day of my period and never any other day. Last year, however, I went paleo after being urged by friends who wouldn't stop assuring me how great it would be for my body. I've never really been too big into meat, and I seriously upped my intake of it in a short period of time. My condition severely worsened, to the point that by the end of last year, I was coughing up large, almost black, blood clots for multiple days, even up to a week after my period had ended. The clots always matched what my period looked like at the time perfectly. 

I probably should have gone to a doctor, but I no longer have health insurance, and when I would go to a doctor they'd just scratch their heads and say everything came back ""normal"". In addition to the increased blood clots, I had much more difficulty breathing and was in so much pain. I was absolutely miserable, and my weight shot up 25 pounds last year due to low energy levels and pain keeping me very sedentary (and probably all of the ""healthy"" animal foods I was eating.)

Right around Christmas, it dawned on me that if upping my intake of animal products apparently made it worse, then maybe it would get better if I cut them out entirely. On Janurary 1st of this year, I went 100% vegan. Mostly whole foods plant based vegan, but sometimes I do eat vegan treats and pizza with daiya ""cheese"" and what not. 

I noticed a difference the very first month. I still coughed up blood, but only once, and significantly less. It was back to only happening on the worst day of my period again, instead of several days. I could breathe much easier and the pain was tolerable again. Things continued to improve each month, to the point that the amount of blood I was coughing up was so minuscule that I probably wouldn't even notice if I wasn't watching for it. 

I just finished my 6th cycle this year (also my cycles got really crazy for a few months and started coming much earlier, but have since leveled out) and DIDN'T COUGH UP ANY BLOOD. I also hiked 8 miles on my worst day and could breathe perfectly the whole time. I experienced no pain whatsoever. I can't believe it. I'm so happy I want to cry. (Side note: I also lost a bunch of weight because I'm eating so much healthier and being much more active since I'm not tired all the time anymore. So that's awesome.)

I also want to say that when I first started this journey, it was VERY difficult, social pressure and backlash from friends is INSANE, so I educated myself on all of the other reasons to go vegan, so I would stick with it. It definitely helped. Earthlings, Gary Yourofsky, Cowspiracy, Forks Over Knives, etc all helped to open my eyes to the fact that my decision is not just about me and my struggles, but the struggles of billions of animals who are tortured and killed for the meat industry EVERY YEAR. 

In a way, I'm actually thankful for what I went through, because it gave me a chance to actually open my eyes to the plight of other species and our planet as a whole. I'm NEVER going back to my old, miserable life, and I'm so thankful that I was able to heal myself by choosing to stop harming others.

It was the most terrifying moment of my life. I could barely breathe. I thought I was dying of a pulmonary embolism, or that I had cancer or some other devastating illness I had never heard of. I was rushed to the ER and was stabbed, poked, prodded, scanned, x-rayed, etc, and was told I was perfectly fine and ""sometimes weird things just happen and it shouldn't happen again"" and was sent on my way. Except it did happen again, for around 50 months straight, linking up perfectly with my menstrual cycles. For the first couple of years, I would only cough up blood on the worst day of my period and never any other day. Last year, however, I went paleo after being urged by friends who wouldn't stop assuring me how great it would be for my body. I've never really been too big into meat, and I seriously upped my intake of it in a short period of time. My condition severely worsened, to the point that by the end of last year, I was coughing up large, almost black, blood clots for multiple days, even up to a week after my period had ended. The clots always matched what my period looked like at the time perfectly. I probably should have gone to a doctor, but I no longer have health insurance, and when I would go to a doctor they'd just scratch their heads and say everything came back ""normal"". In addition to the increased blood clots, I had much more difficulty breathing and was in so much pain. I was absolutely miserable, and my weight shot up 25 pounds last year due to low energy levels and pain keeping me very sedentary (and probably all of the ""healthy"" animal foods I was eating.) Right around Christmas, it dawned on me that if upping my intake of animal products apparently made it worse, then maybe it would get better if I cut them out entirely. On Janurary 1st of this year, I went 100% vegan. Mostly whole foods plant based vegan, but sometimes I do eat vegan treats and pizza with daiya ""cheese"" and what not. I noticed a difference the very first month. I still coughed up blood, but only once, and significantly less. It was back to only happening on the worst day of my period again, instead of several days. I could breathe much easier and the pain was tolerable again. Things continued to improve each month, to the point that the amount of blood I was coughing up was so minuscule that I probably wouldn't even notice if I wasn't watching for it. I just finished my 6th cycle this year (also my cycles got really crazy for a few months and started coming much earlier, but have since leveled out) and DIDN'T COUGH UP ANY BLOOD. I also hiked 8 miles on my worst day and could breathe perfectly the whole time. I experienced no pain whatsoever. I can't believe it. I'm so happy I want to cry. (Side note: I also lost a bunch of weight because I'm eating so much healthier and being much more active since I'm not tired all the time anymore. So that's awesome.) I also want to say that when I first started this journey, it was VERY difficult, social pressure and backlash from friends is INSANE, so I educated myself on all of the other reasons to go vegan, so I would stick with it. It definitely helped. Earthlings, Gary Yourofsky, Cowspiracy, Forks Over Knives, etc all helped to open my eyes to the fact that my decision is not just about me and my struggles, but the struggles of billions of animals who are tortured and killed for the meat industry EVERY YEAR. In a way, I'm actually thankful for what I went through, because it gave me a chance to actually open my eyes to the plight of other species and our planet as a whole. I'm NEVER going back to my old, miserable life, and I'm so thankful that I was able to heal myself by choosing to stop harming others.","['personal', 'account', 'living', 'bizarre', 'condition', 'disturbing', 'symptoms', 'might', 'tmi', 'parts', 'blood', 'like', 'freaks', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'years', 'ago', 'laid', 'sleep', 'night', 'felt', 'like', 'drowning', 'blood', 'randomly', 'started', 'coughing', 'terrifying', 'moment', 'life', 'could', 'barely', 'breathe', 'thought', 'dying', 'pulmonary', 'embolism', 'cancer', 'devastating', 'illness', 'never', 'heard', 'rushed', 'stabbed', 'poked', 'prodded', 'scanned', 'x-rayed', 'etc', 'told', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'sometimes', 'weird', 'things', 'happen', ""n't"", 'happen', 'sent', 'way', 'except', 'happen', 'around', 'months', 'straight', 'linking', 'perfectly', 'menstrual', 'cycles', 'first', 'couple', 'years', 'would', 'cough', 'blood', 'worst', 'day', 'period', 'never', 'day', 'last', 'year', 'however', 'went', 'paleo', 'urged', 'friends', 'would', ""n't"", 'stop', 'assuring', 'great', 'would', 'body', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'big', 'meat', 'seriously', 'upped', 'intake', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'condition', 'severely', 'worsened', 'point', 'end', 'last', 'year', 'coughing', 'large', 'almost', 'black', 'blood', 'clots', 'multiple', 'days', 'even', 'week', 'period', 'ended', 'clots', 'always', 'matched', 'period', 'looked', 'like', 'time', 'perfectly', 'probably', 'gone', 'doctor', 'longer', 'health', 'insurance', 'would', 'doctor', 'scratch', 'heads', 'say', 'everything', 'came', 'back', 'normal', 'addition', 'increased', 'blood', 'clots', 'much', 'difficulty', 'breathing', 'much', 'pain', 'absolutely', 'miserable', 'weight', 'shot', 'pounds', 'last', 'year', 'due', 'low', 'energy', 'levels', 'pain', 'keeping', 'sedentary', 'probably', 'healthy', 'animal', 'foods', 'eating', 'right', 'around', 'christmas', 'dawned', 'upping', 'intake', 'animal', 'products', 'apparently', 'made', 'worse', 'maybe', 'would', 'get', 'better', 'cut', 'entirely', 'janurary', '1st', 'year', 'went', '100', 'vegan', 'mostly', 'whole', 'foods', 'plant', 'based', 'vegan', 'sometimes', 'eat', 'vegan', 'treats', 'pizza', 'daiya', 'cheese', 'noticed', 'difference', 'first', 'month', 'still', 'coughed', 'blood', 'significantly', 'less', 'back', 'happening', 'worst', 'day', 'period', 'instead', 'several', 'days', 'could', 'breathe', 'much', 'easier', 'pain', 'tolerable', 'things', 'continued', 'improve', 'month', 'point', 'amount', 'blood', 'coughing', 'minuscule', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', ""n't"", 'watching', 'finished', '6th', 'cycle', 'year', 'also', 'cycles', 'got', 'really', 'crazy', 'months', 'started', 'coming', 'much', 'earlier', 'since', 'leveled', ""n't"", 'cough', 'blood', 'also', 'hiked', 'miles', 'worst', 'day', 'could', 'breathe', 'perfectly', 'whole', 'time', 'experienced', 'pain', 'whatsoever', ""n't"", 'believe', 'happy', 'want', 'cry', 'side', 'note', 'also', 'lost', 'bunch', 'weight', 'eating', 'much', 'healthier', 'much', 'active', 'since', 'tired', 'time', 'anymore', 'awesome', 'also', 'want', 'say', 'first', 'started', 'journey', 'difficult', 'social', 'pressure', 'backlash', 'friends', 'insane', 'educated', 'reasons', 'vegan', 'would', 'stick', 'definitely', 'helped', 'earthlings', 'gary', 'yourofsky', 'cowspiracy', 'forks', 'knives', 'etc', 'helped', 'open', 'eyes', 'fact', 'decision', 'struggles', 'struggles', 'billions', 'animals', 'tortured', 'killed', 'meat', 'industry', 'every', 'year', 'way', 'actually', 'thankful', 'went', 'gave', 'chance', 'actually', 'open', 'eyes', 'plight', 'species', 'planet', 'whole', 'never', 'going', 'back', 'old', 'miserable', 'life', 'thankful', 'able', 'heal', 'choosing', 'stop', 'harming', 'others']",[],0,4010,371
