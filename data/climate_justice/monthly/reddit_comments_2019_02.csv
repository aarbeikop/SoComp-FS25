1. Trump can't prove there's an emergency there so he presents some BS data to the SC and the SC allows it.

>Within the limited funding available in the Department of Homeland Security bill, we will fight for balanced investments across the Department’s mission areas. We will push for a smart, effective border security posture, one that does not rely on costly physical barriers. House Democrats’ proposal funds:

> - 1,000 new Customs officers;

> - New imaging technology at the land ports of entry to ensure all vehicles are scanned before entering the country for drugs and other contraband.

> - New equipment at mail processing facilities to interdict fentanyl and other opioids shipped through the international mail;

> - New cutting edge technology along the border to improve situational awareness;

> - An expansion of CBP’s air and marine operations along the border and in U.S. waters;

> - An expansion of risk-based targeting of passengers and cargo entering the United States; and

> - Critical repair projects at ports of entry.

> Our proposal at conference negotiations also:

> - Addresses the only real crisis at the border – which is not a border security crisis but a humanitarian one – by improving CBP’s capacity to appropriately meet the needs of migrants who are temporarily in their custody.

> - Supports the hiring of new Homeland Security Investigations agents to focus on drug smuggling, gang crimes, financial crimes, and other high priority law enforcement areas.

> - Expands ICE’s Alternatives to Detention program, including family case management.

> - Significantly reduces ICE detention beds; requires more frequent detention facility inspections, and limits ICE’s ability to use more detention beds than Congress intends to fund.

> - In addition, our proposal supports many other important Homeland Security priorities, which we will not have the funding to address if the President insists we set aside $5.7 billion for border barriers. 

> These include, for example:

> - Targeted increases in FEMA preparedness grant programs;

> - Support for the Coast Guard’s personnel and air and marine fleets, include a new polar icebreaker;

> - Investments in TSA’s ability to detect threats at security checkpoints without slowing air travel.

2) North Korea is still building bombs.

3) Said allies were taking advantage of us. 

4) Left a nuclear treaty that allows Russia to build bombs with no chance of international scrutiny.

5) His budget calls for $500 million for cancer, $5.2 billion for a useless wall. The GOP rejected a $46 billion border protection bill in 2013.

6) Why attack immigrants and not the ones who hire them for cheap to avoid paying citizens a living wage?

7) Venezuela and other South American nations are in turmoil because we've toppled their governments for decades.

8) Immigrants who murder will not cause *nearly* the same amount of death as climate change. In fact, illegal immigrants are not the most violent demographic in America. 

9) Yay oil (climate change) and asbestos?

10) He suddenly champions science.


11) Hey WWII vets and survivors: how was it fighting in a war where there were good people on both sides?


12) Government oversight is not a partisan issue. How about be less of a criminal?

13) Tax cuts fucked the middle class, and helped the wealthy.

14) The late term abortion bill is only to save mothers whose lives are in danger. Not *executing* babies. And Christ, Trump was pro choice less than a decade ago. Abortion is never an easy choice, and women's bodies are not the property of others.

15) Wanna piss and moan about judges? Merrick Garland. *Merrick fucking Garland.* What about his two years of GOP control, and other ambassador positions unfilled?

Always nice to follow one of Trump's speeches with a response from someone with a consistent, coherent message who can actually articulate himself.

"efulwwo","t3_anmh43","anmh43","politics","unknown","Heh coincidence: I was looking up El Paso crime stats and CNN just did a fact check on it.

Did the wall/fence drastically reduce crime right after being built as Trump claimed?  Nope.  Completely false.

El Paso DID have high crime rates, but those peaked in the early 90's and dropped rapidly.  It flatlined at around the same time that the fence was first built, and not after like Trump claimed.

In fact, the El Paso crime rates peak and drop mirrors the rest of America: peaking in the early 90's, then plummetting to historic lows.  All BEFORE their border fence was built in 2008-09.  El Paso crime rates hit their bottom in 2006.
