Be able to afford it with a part-time job and graduate with zero debt.

Get a high-paying job in manufacturing as the industrial world still rebuilds but before the developing world develops.

Put your money in a savings account that actually generates interest.

Get a mortgage from heavily-regulated lenders (regulations put in place by the Greatest Generation to prevent a new Depression).

Pay taxes that actually pay for services.

Get a house and kids. Decide you're sick of paying taxes.

Vote for Reagan.

Eliminate the finance regulations designed to prevent a depression (and the inequality of the Gilded Age).

Decide colleges are turning out too many smug liberals, vote for reps and governors who promise to cut their funding. Besides, this whole affirmative action thing is reverse racism.

Decide you're sick of smug academics and TV personalities telling you everyone is equal. Call your representative and ask them to repeal the Fairness Doctrine.

Decide you don't like that UN-loving Ted Turner and his CNN. Turn on this new thing called Fox News from Roger Ailes, the Nixon political hack who helped build the Republicans' racist Southern Strategy and helped Lee Atwater make the Willie Horton ad.

Make a fuck-ton off the Clinton economy while calling Clinton the worst president ever.

Celebrate the repeal of Glass-Steagall and the final vestiges of the protections your parents and grandparents' generations set up to prevent another Depression.

Respond to news stories about skyrocketing college costs with smug diatribe about how you worked your way through your $500/year college.

Blame NAFTA for the fact that Europe & Japan rebuilt after WWII, sapping US manufacturing jobs, while the former USSR joins the world economy, as does China and to some extent India. Ignore the fact that the world manufacturing base is now gigantic and America has competition it never had. Also ignore robots, which means rich countries need a fraction of the # of humans to run the same size factory as before. Blame it on immigrants, too, for reasons.

Make money off the tech bubble while Gen X loses its first savings account. laugh.

Vote for George W. Bush because he promises to give the federal surplus (yes, there was a surplus) to you instead of paying down the national debt.

Inequality reaches 1890s levels but who cares? greed is good.

Support Iraq after protesting Vietnam because fuck it, you're not going this time.

Somehow decide the 2007-08 financial crash was because things are too regulated.

Incoherently argue that the center-left Democrat Barack Obama (but you always say his middle name), who wants to accomplish an agenda item the democrats have pushed for 70 years, is a radical. For some reason.

Cheer on smug turtle Mitch McConnell as he prevents the government from doing anything.

Call Obama a dictator for trying to work around Mitch McConnell.

Read about how whites will be a minority in 2040

Talk about how Trump is ""our last chance"" to ""take back America."" Ask what's wrong with saying black people are more criminal. Ask what's wrong with saying Latino immigrants will ruin our culture.

Insist to your kids, who are crippled by student debt, but whom you chastise for not having a home or kids yet, that they just don't understand how money works.

Be completely ignorant that every generation before you and every generation after you has always considered the Baby Boomers to be the most titanically selfish group of humans to ever live and die on this earth.

"deyxbl5","t3_5zkmmp","5zkmmp","politics","unknown","It's an interesting thesis, but I'm curious which definition of ""sociopath"" you're using and are attempting to show applies to baby boomers writ large.

Based on your article in the Globe, I'm guessing you're not attempting to show that some huge group of boomers meet the DSM-V definition of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), so are you instead using the term more colloquially to describe a group of people who care more about benefitting themselves than their effect on others?

If so, I'm curious (aside from grandiosity) how your use would differ from ""narcissism"" (classically viewed less as ""I'm the best"" and more as ""I'm the only thing that really matters"").

To say nothing of your argument seeming only to work if you look exclusively at the generations immediately before and after the boomers, ignoring those prior to the World War II generation.

Every symptom of the horror of boomers can be found in some prior generation. 

Nativism blaming broad societal, environmental, and economic problems on ""immigrants"", times of economic ""improvidence"", high crime rates, lies by politicians, economic inequality? All there.

Boom-and-bust economic waves, bubbles around emerging industries? Those have been featured of capitalism pretty much forever.

And if Boomerism is still in full swing, how do you explain the historically low crime rate?

You argue that the economic growth of the post-war period was ended by boomers taking control of government policy. How do you account for the natural loss of economic dominance as other countries managed to recover from World War II?

Finally, your timeline of when the Boomers gained predominance as compared to the bad things they caused seems a bit fluid. Somehow Boomers were the driving force of crime from their 20s all the way through their 40s, how does that work? If young people commit the most crime (since most crime is small-scale) how were the boomers still responsible in the 90s? If, on the other hand, the older generation's policies are responsible for crime (as in the 90s), how were the 20-something boomers of the 70s the cause?

To say nothing of your tendency to give credit for every good thing which overlapped with boomers to something else (well millennials did Silicon Valley if we exclude Jobs, Wozniak, Gates, and a bunch of others) while every bad thing was their fault (well the boomers didn't control Silicon Valley but it's their fault there was a dot-com bubble in and regarding Silicon Valley).

I get that so far there's a lot of hagiographical ""wowzers you're so insightful, how can we millennials fix the problems you rightly pay at the feet of baby boomers"". But it'd be nice to know there's more to this than just writing the same ""blame this generation for bad things and call them names"" which has been used against every other generation.","2017-03-15 18:26:26","11","BolshevikMuppet","1747853878.469297","climate justice","manual"

This march doesn't appear to have a purpose outside of virtue signaling about science being great. It doesn't even specifically reference what funding is being cut in the part about defunding or what you recommend funding in it's place.

I'm a scientist who disagrees with the marchforscience because my experience in reality doesn't align with what you appear to be putting forward. It is not anti-intellectualism or lack of diversity that is wingclipping the scientists of the future, it's the dynamics of global economics. The fact that that is unaddressed alienates me as a scientist from your cause.

Here is why I would not suggest someone become a Chemist as I did (In ultra summary form). Even if someone was passionate about Chemistry I would tell them to think long and hard about joining my field. With respect to pharmaceuticals. Large companies are outsourcing large amounts of their workforces or recruiting largely low wage foreign nationals, driving the payscale of incoming entry level scientists through the floor. massive prohibitive costs by regulatory agencies make production of in human therapeutics insanely expensive. This has driven the industry more towards sourcing their projects by buying out (often foreign based) CROs or simply contracting the development milestones to the CROs leading to downsizing or elimination of domestic R&D. Doing specialist contract labor or flipping companies isn't an entry level market so there is often no place for entry level employees in this new ecosystem. Due to a mixture of economic recession and decreased federal spending the idea of getting a PhD and then entering tenure track academic careers is becoming less and less viable. These days if you get a degree you're looking at having spent 8+ years in school (ignoring post doc work if you do that) to fight tooth and nail over relatively low paying jobs with no chance at advancement not only against other domestic grads, but foreign grads and against an enormous force of experienced workers who are now re-entering the workforce.

So when I see the bleak future of myself and my fellow scientists early in their career and I see awful job/career prospects due to regulation/outsourcing/globalization/economics and you march on washington with non-concrete handwavey goals about diversity and outreach it makes me want to distance myself from your movement.","2017-03-31 16:12:08","104","doctorcrass","1747853950.0290492","climate justice","manual"

I am currently planning on attending, but it is clear to me (from Facebook, Twitter, and my own lab) that people have growing concerns about the way the march is heading. Specifically, the march seems to have gotten a bit off-topic by incorporating LGBTQ issues, as well as some pseudoscience groups, into its core mission. While I am extremely liberal and an active supporter of LGBTQ and similar movements (not the pseudoscience, though), many scientists simply aren't interested in marching for those things. Thus, incorporating ""protest culture"" into the march has taken away from the core message of the group, politicizing and polarizing what should be a non-partisan issue. 

My questions

- How do you plan to keep the march on topic? Lots of people are mad at the moves this administration is making, and for lots of reasons. Is the point just to raise numbers and get everyone involved to show how mad we are about the entire direction of the whole country, or to effect specific policy changes that we want as a field/pursuit/industry? 

- Do you not alienate, say, Evangelical Christian or Muslim scientists from your march by claiming that the social liberal agenda is a ""scientific issue""? What about public perception among social conservatives who support science, biomedical research, or biotechnology? 

- I know you aren't the ""thought police"" but how do you intend to prevent pseudoscience groups (like anti-vaxxers) from using this march as a platform to legitimize their movements?","2017-03-31 15:14:41","86","subito_lucres","1747853950.031275","climate justice","manual"
"dfnjyk5","t3_62kss7","62kss7","science","scientific","I'm not crazy about the march. Here's my main two reasons why.

(1) The public doesn't perceive that scientists are not passionate or caring. The public perceives that scientists don't work on issues relevant to everyday concerns and don't come to a single concrete consensus the way other professional classes do. A march isn't going to help explain why, for example, working on the development of a fly eye is relevant to understanding cancer in humans. (It is! Ask a molecular biologist why!) Or why having 98% of scientists agree on man-made climate change IS a consensus. That level of dissent is ridiculously low for matters scientific.

(2) The numbers are going to be poor relative to other marches. The visuals of fewer people than the inaguration or women's march, for example, will not do the scientific community any favors among those who are sore about the perceived ""slight"" by the media about reports of low inaguration numbers. 

There are a lot of things we can do to promote science in this country. Walking through the streets of DC chanting ""Hey Hey Ho Ho NIH cuts have got to go"" is not one of them. 

Activism is good, but a march, not so much.

"dfnb34l","t3_62kss7","62kss7","science","scientific","Hi everyone, and thank you for doing this AMA. I think the March for Science is a great idea, and I am looking forward to marching myself in DC later next month.

I have a couple of questions for you. First, you say:

> The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.

This is something that I think sounds great in principle, but is a bit hard to define when you get closer to the problem. For example, what is the criteria for determining whether a national science program is being 'robustly funded' (a percentage of GDP?) or what do you mean by science that is 'publicly communicated' (is this a critique of paywalled journals?).


My second question relates to a talking point that I have seen floating around your social media - the idea that the March is a non-partisan, but political event. I get the concept, and I understand why a nonprofit organization has to be non-partisan, but let's be real: in the U.S. the major threat to science and scientific policy comes from Republicans and in particular the Republican in the White House. I say this because, I have seen the idea that ""both sides have anti-science views"" gain traction. That seems like a huge false equivalency to me. No major policy position by the Democratic party comes anywhere near the level of some of the anti-science policies GOPers in the US are clamoring to enact. So I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that, and I wish I would hear a lot less of the ""both sides are bad"" nonsense from the MfS.

So much so, that it generated a counter-movement, and some people roll their eyes at the first mention of the word ""science"". This type of trend dynamics is common to other things like fashion, music styles and so on. I would argue, admittedly without any hard evidence, that we've reached ""peak science"", and perhaps we are enduring the backlash.

Now, conjectures apart, I don't think you can teach science, same way you can't teach religion. Attempting to do so is very superficial, and all you're left with are dogmas. In a way, without sufficient understanding, people will accept science the same they accept any other ideas: that is to say, blindly. On the other hand, you'll have people rejecting science for similar reasons. More important than teaching ""science"", is probably teaching philosophy and give person rational tools to make up their own minds. If not philosophy, at least a strong critical sense, which is maybe what science boils down to. I'd argue this is the best way to avoid those dogmas, and the main difference between a religious and a scientific view of reality.

I realized I don't really have a question, but these two: 

1. what exactly is the message you are trying to get across?

2. what is your plan to do it and minimize the backlash, and without sounding ""pedantic"" or ""passé"", bearing in mind that that message will be filtered by the media?

How do you counter the concern among scientists that this march actually strengthens that unfair argument by literally making it an agenda item?

How do you justify politicising that which should be inherently apolitical?","2017-03-31 15:10:37","37","captmrwill","1747853950.043311","climate justice","manual"

Thanks for hosting this AMA!

Having ran large(ish) events in academic environments before, I've found that there is often a lot of friction and sometimes conflict with managing the expectations of different parties. Despite the public perception of scientists all uniformly striving towards one singular aim, this is sometimes not the case (thankfully it was uncommon in my experiences, but it did happen).

How do you manage the expectations of different teams trying to influence how the March is handled and organised, and how do you try to balance out any friction that often comes with such large events and movements?","2017-03-31 12:31:55","26","OldBoltonian","1747853950.044713","climate justice","manual"

"dfnjaup","t3_62kss7","62kss7","science","scientific","How do you plan to unite all of your marchers behind the importance of all scientific research as a whole? 

>We are people who value science and recognize how science serves. We come from all races, all religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all abilities, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives, and all nationalities. Our diversity is our greatest strength: a wealth of opinions, perspectives, and ideas is critical for the scientific process. What unites us is a love of science, and an insatiable curiosity. We all recognize that science is everywhere and affects everyone.

While this is a great message, I worry about that diversity when it comes to science in particular. I find many who tout the importance science to be all too similar to many of those who practice religion in that they pick and choose what parts to believe, practice, and live by. I foresee people in this movement touting vaccines and climate science while blaspheming GMOs, and other various combinations of this. 

Outside of the march, will there be any speeches, workshops, and other ways to stress the benefits of all types of scientific studies?","2017-03-31 15:34:09","28","Messiah","1747853950.0480242","climate justice","manual"

Can you comment on the challenges unique to organizing scientists and science enthusiasts for such a large event? My assumption would be that we're typically harder to motivate to do things that aren't in the lab, field, or interview room, and not as experienced in politics or activism as people who are passionate about other issues. 

How do you maintain engagement and focus of such a non-traditional group of activists? ","2017-03-31 12:26:31","23","superhelical","1747853950.0492759","climate justice","manual"

One of the criticisms of the march that I've heard is that it will only serve to pigeonhole scientists into another biased interest group. In other words it may end up being more anti-Trump than pro-science which would ultimately make others less likely to listen to the message.
