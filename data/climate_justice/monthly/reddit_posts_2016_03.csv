"492k81","politics","unknown","Why this is the most important election of our lifetime","Hell if I know where I should be posting this, so this is probably as good as anywhere else. If you think I'm simplifying things and leaving out details, it's because I'm keeping this as short as possible. Want the TL;DR? Check out the bolded headings.

**This is the most important election of our lifetime because of climate change**

I'm a researcher in this field. The science has been settled for decades, but you don't need to look to scientists for the proof. If you're still a skeptic, look at how the oil and gas companies are making plans to gather resources from a warmer arctic, or how military and intelligence organizations are planning for social and political upheaval. *Climate change is happening, and it's happening now.*

We need to make meaningful changes to mitigate the effects of climate change immediately. At risk are our food and water security. Our infrastructure. Our economy and environment. If we keep the status quo, we're screwed in a couple decades. If we make incremental changes, we buy ourselves another couple years. *We need to make meaningful changes now.*

**Climate change is directly related to income inequality**

Climate change is exacerbated because those with money and access take actions that delay meaningful changes or expedite resource extraction. If we address the corruption and bribery and imbalance that lead to income inequality, we have a chance at addressing climate change.

**Income inequality is the issue that should bind us together as Americans**

For Trump supporters, polls show that you're upset about trade agreements like TPP. These trade agreements are lobbied for, and often written by, those with money and access. If we address the corruption and bribery and imbalance that lead to income inequality, we have a chance to make trade agreements that benefit middle-class Americans.

For Hillary supporters, polls show that you're upset about the lack of progress in gender, racial, and LGBT issues. Social progress is stymied by numerous factors, including the lack of official policies to support working families and the scapegoating of minorities to economically-disadvantaged whites. If we address the corruption and bribery and imbalance that lead to income inequality, we have a chance to reshape our social contracts.

For Bernie supporters, we need to start having conversations about why income inequality is the most important issue, about how it's tied to everything else we care about. People across the political spectrum are disgusted with the system, and we need to find common ground on the root causes of our discontent; namely, income inequality and a political class that does not represent us.

**Our politicians want us to focus on our differences, the solutions require that we focus on our shared values**

Democrats and Republicans benefit when we're divided. They want us to argue about whether we're pro-abortion or pro-life, rather than talking honestly about how to reduce the number of mothers considering abortions. They want us to argue about whether we're for or against affirmative action, rather than discussing how to improve educational and career opportunities. They want us to argue about whether we want lower taxes or more government services, rather than agreeing that we should get something of value for the taxes we already pay.

What's the result? There's no correlation between the values of the middle class and the policies our representatives enact. *It's good news when our politicians cannot agree and our government is broken; it's bad news when our politicians agree and implement policies that hurt us.*

**Bernie Sanders is the first viable candidate in my lifetime that might facilitate real change**

We've been able to vote for opportunistic politicians, who see which way the wind is blowing before making decisions. We've been able to vote for divisive politicians, who play up differences and stereotypes to engage their supporters. We've been able to vote for lukewarm moderates, who lend their support to the largest donors. And they all find lucrative jobs as lobbyists after they leave office.

Bernie Sanders is going to tell you exactly what he thinks and he's going to do exactly what he says. Sure, I may not agree with him all the time, but *I'd rather trust my well-being to an honest person with the best intentions, than a dishonest person with the best ambitions.* He'll use the presidency to highlight the problems in our political system, call out the bullshit in both parties, fight for meaningful changes at a national level, and shift the conversation to support grassroots movements.

**Vote for Bernie because it's the best chance we have**

There's no way to know whether any of the candidates will be able to facilitate changes in our society, or whether these changes are even possible given entrenched interests and societal inertia. If this were any other election, we could just roll the dice with any of these candidates and, even if things went poorly, it would turn out fine in the long run. Remember, ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice"", and all that.

But, again, this is not a standard election. Climate change needs to be addressed immediately, or there is no long-run to speak of.

Look at their records. Based on previous actions, anyone running as a Republican is going to roll back efforts to address climate change. Based on previous actions, Hillary is going to take one step forward and ten steps back. Bernie is our only chance to elect someone who will fight to ensure we have a future for our children and grandchildren... and for ourselves.","2016-03-05 14:19:49","7","23","0.55","https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/492k81/why_this_is_the_most_important_election_of_our/","True","as_the_world_berns","1747851557.2798479","climate justice","manual"
