"d0ojg3q","t3_492k81","492k81","politics","unknown","Meh. They're all important. I think we need to stop putting so much weight on Presidental elections being the most important elections ever. Sure, they're important but unless we also bother to vote in local/state/midterm elections there isn't going to be a lot being done. 

2008 was a very important election sure, but Americans voters couldn't be bothered to vote in 2010/2014. Thus you have the current Congress. 

Even if Bernie somehow wins in 2016 (and his odds atm aren't great), the likelyhood based on past elections is that most Americans will stay home in 2018.

Unfortunately the inertia of entrenched special interests will do its best to quell any real efforts to change things. I will remain optimistic and keep supporting Sanders and his ideas but I'm losing my faith in the American voters this election season.

If we address the corruption and bribery and imbalance that lead to income inequality, we have a chance at addressing climate change.

I don't understand why you believe the environmental state of affairs would be any better off under a different distribution of wealth.  Does that somehow put an end to the demand for or consumption of resources causing climate change?","2016-03-05 15:37:29","3","barbe_du_cou","1747851557.625319","climate justice","manual"

Intentions get everyone nothing.  The presidency isn't a job where you should be able to get by on going ""Well Shucks I sure did mean to do this but I just couldn't"".  Delivery on those issues he's running on is key.  And I've not seen a way he does.

I do agree how ever climate change is one of the biggest driving issues in the future of our country and our planet.  Which is why I support Clinton.  That historic Climate change (I'm not sure if it was a treaty or some other word i'm reaching for and I can't find) that Obama negociated last year was one of the biggest deals we've managed globally in some time on that issue.  China signed on.  And that was because of the skill and Juice the Obama administration has.  And in my opinion Sander's lacks.  Climate change isn't just an place where we can solve it in our country it has to be tackled globally.  And Clinton has such juice, connections, and experience from her time as Secretary of state and in her time as first lady.","2016-03-05 14:33:52","2","gdex86","1747851557.62873","climate justice","manual"
