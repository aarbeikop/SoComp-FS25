"4e1mnl","politics","unknown","Bernie Sanders has the best energy plan for the US. Here's why","Most of the things written about Senator Sanders’ candidacy this election season have focused on his social justice platform, “democratic socialist” label, the unlikelihood of his campaign or his young, passionate followers. While these topics are no doubt popular with mass market media audiences, I would like to bring up a less often discussed aspect of his platform and one of the primary reasons I support him - his energy policy. 

Like many of his policies the Sanders’ energy plan is transformative and sweeping in scope. Some of the highlights are:

* 100% renewable energy (no fossil fuels or nuclear) national grid by 2050
* Creates a new national laboratory to promote clean energy innovation
* Makes climate change a national priority
* Ends all taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuels 
* Creates (an estimated) 10 million good paying jobs in clean energy
* Gradually phases out existing nuclear plants as permits expire
* Lowers long term US energy costs
* Implements a tax on carbon

The full plan can be viewed at his website (I originally included the link to it but the 'moderator bot' considered that as spam I guess. Sorry)

Here’s why I support these goals.

1. The global transition to the new energy economy represents the largest economic opportunity of our century. I believe the economic impact will dwarf even that of the Information Age technology revolution. The transition is inevitable and already beginning, but countries that lead and embrace it the most will be the biggest beneficiaries of the unprecedented global economic boom it creates.
2. The benefits of a 100% renewable energy grid, among them much lower energy costs and cleaner air/water, will improve quality of life for all Americans.
3. Ending fossil fuel dependence is the Great Challenge of our time. It has the potential to unite the population around a common goal that will provide enormous benefits to our country and the world. Taking a leading role in combating climate change will restore US moral leadership in the world community.

No other presidential candidate this election season has a plan nearly as aspirational and forward looking. I believe Sen. Sanders’ plan will reduce carbon emissions and energy costs more quickly, and put the US more firmly in a leadership position in the technological and economic races than any of the other candidates’ plans.  

There are, of course, other opinions on what the ‘best’ energy policy is for the country, and passions are especially amplified during a presidential election season. Mere mention of his plan on forums such as this often brings spirited responses, some challenging the efficacy of it.
 
In the following paragraphs I will attempt to dispel the more common and legitimate concerns about Sanders’ plan that I’ve seen raised on this forum, and hopefully stimulate some thoughtful and respectful dialog about it. Thanks for reading this far!


**The technologies required for an affordable renewable energy grid are non-existent and far in the future.**

I shared this concern not too many years ago. But having studied the advances in solar, wind and storage technologies in the past decade or two, and witnessed the breathtaking plunge in renewable energy costs in the last few years I’m no longer even a mild skeptic. My thinking first began to shift after reading this feature article in Scientific American back in 2009 - 

[*A Plan for a Sustainable Future - How to get all energy from wind, water and solar power by 2030*](https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/sad1109Jaco5p.indd.pdf)

Stanford professor Mark Jacobson, author of the article, is a widely-cited expert in the field and testified to Congress on the subject last year. Since publishing this article he and his team have produced detailed technical and economic studies showing how the US, and the entire world, could end all dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear energy by 2050 with **existing technology**. It’s even more aggressive than Senator Sanders’ plan but it details solutions to all of the technical and economic concerns I’ve seen raised. If you are technically inclined you may enjoy this more recent publication by his team -

[*100% clean and renewable wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) all-sector energy roadmaps for the 50 United States*](http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/USStatesWWS.pdf)

**The sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow.**

Since it comes up so often I will quickly summarize the proposed solution to the so-called “intermittency problem”, even though it’s also detailed in the above paper. It’s actually a mix of solutions matched to each region, consisting overall of well-designed grids integrating diverse mixes of renewable energy technologies (onshore wind, offshore wind, concentrated solar (CSP), rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), utility-scale solar PV, hydroelectric, geothermal, wave and tidal), load-leveling policies and technologies, hydroelectric generation used as variable ‘peaking’ capacity, careful capacity planning based on geography-specific wind and solar yields, long distance grid interconnections and a modest amount of storage (pumped hydro, CSP with storage, other thermal storage, hydrogen, etc). Exotic new utility-scale battery technologies are not required, but will certainly make the job easier when they become commercially viable. Here is a separate paper from the Stanford team on the topic of reliably matching renewable energy generation to changing demand - 

[*Low-cost solution to the grid reliability problem with 100% penetration of intermittent wind, water, and solar for all purposes*](http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CombiningRenew/CONUSGridIntegration.pdf)

I will also note that construction of the long, high-capacity low-loss transmission lines necessary to move large quantities of renewable energy from regions where it is plentiful to population centers is already underway led by organizations like Clean Line Energy Partners.

[*Clean Line Energy Partners Projects*](http://www.cleanlineenergy.com/projects)

**Renewable energy will always be too expensive.**

Very few, if any, experts are still saying this given what’s been happening across the world. Wind energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels and solar is fast approaching. Both are benefitting from the cost learning curve as volumes ramp up, while the costs of fossil fuels and nuclear energy will continue to rise. For those interested in seeing a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each type of power generation mentioned here (and more!) the US Energy Information Administration puts out a detailed report each year. Here is the latest -

[*Levelized Cost and Levelized Avoided Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2015*](https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf)


And a couple of articles - 

[*How Solar and Wind Got So Cheap, So Fast*](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/how-solar-and-wind-got-so-cheap-so-fast/418257/)

[*Wind and Solar Are Crushing Fossil Fuels*](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels)

And, lastly, 
**You can’t build a reliable electric grid without nuclear or coal “baseload” generation.**

The concept of utility-scale generation being classified as either “baseload” or “peaking” has been around for a long, long time. It was based on the particular economics of mainstream power plants and how to most economically fit them to an ever-changing demand curve. “Baseload” units are expensive and time-consuming to build, have large output capacities and relatively low energy costs and are designed to run at full capacity all the time. “Peaking” units (generally gas turbines) are smaller and less expensive to build but more expensive to run, but can be quickly spun up or down to match changing demand. Thus power systems were designed to employ these so-called “baseload” units running at full capacity 24/7 to meet the minimum daily demands and “peaking” units to follow the peaks and valleys of shifting demand above that level. 

In other words, there is no technical requirement for the minimum load to be met with coal or nuclear plants (or hydroelectric where available) only, it was just the most cost-effective way to design and manage a utility’s generation portfolio. Up until recently. 

Modern renewable energy sources are now radically changing the economic equation. Wind and solar ‘farms’, once online, produce virtually free energy. As a result, when sunshine, wind or water based energy is plentiful it’s more cost-effective to prioritize that over coal or nuclear energy with production requiring continual fuel consumption and round-the-clock operations personnel. 

But since these large plants are not designed to be started and stopped quickly and running them at less than full capacity makes them even less cost-effective the best solution going forward is to phase them out as wind, water and solar technologies ramp up and displace more and more of the previous “baseload” demand. Here’s another take on it -

[*Dispelling the nuclear 'baseload' myth: nothing renewables can't do better!*](http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2987376/dispelling_the_nuclear_baseload_myth_nothing_renewables_cant_do_better.html)

**Who Is More Qualified?**

Question to Sanders: You accused Hillary of having a “credibility gap”, do you think she has the judgment to be president?

**Sanders:**

Brings up that those were a response to the Clinton Campaign on [MSNBC]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxQHPrJ2sDo&feature=youtu.be&t=1m18s) and [Washington post headlines](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/06/clinton-questions-whether-sanders-is-qualified-to-be-president/) when Sanders responded with saying [she is unqualified](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/06/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-qualified/). Repeats that she has the experience and intelligence to be president but questions her judgment in [voting for Iraq](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-iraq-war-vote-mistake-iowa-118109), [disastrous trade agreements]( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/10/bernie-s/clinton-voted-virtually-every-trade-agreement-kill/), and her [rabid use of Super-Pacs]( https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00000019). 

**Hillary:**

States that this is the [first time](http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/four-times-the-clintons-said-obama-was-unqualified-to-be-president/) she has ever been called unqualified. Reminds that the people of NY and Obama think she is qualified. Doesn’t think that he knows what he is talking about while referencing his [interview with NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-bernie-sanders-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2588306), even concerning his core message and foreign policy. 

**Sanders:**

Mentions how he led the opposition to the [Iraq War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdFw1btbkLM), Hillary Clinton’s use of [501(c)(4)s]( https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/07/19528/inside-hillary-clintons-big-money-cavalry), and questions if she will bring change while taking big money. Also slips in that we need to guarantee healthcare for all.

**Hillary:** 

This is an attack on her and Obama. [Obama used Super-Pacs](https://theintercept.com/2016/04/15/barack-obama-never-said-money-wasnt-corrupting-in-fact-he-said-the-opposite/) as well and it didn’t affect him. Claims there is no evidence that [money will influence her decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12mJ-U76nfg).

**Sanders’ Score: 6/10**

Addresses his attacks on Hillary as a response to her attacks on him, defending that her insinuating he is unqualified and him using the word “unqualified” are no different. Bolsters argument that she is indeed unqualified. Does a weak job of defending her attack that he doesn’t know what he is talking about and fails to mention the [NY Times refuting Hillary Clinton](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/upshot/yes-bernie-sanders-knows-something-about-breaking-up-banks.html?_r=0) or defending himself with his own words when given the opportunity. Starts to lose focus of counterargument.

**Hillary’s Score: 8/10**

Doesn’t do a sufficient job in defending herself as qualified; brings up experience but fails to mention any notable results. Lands harsh attacks on Sanders that are weakly defended, but largely doesn’t do a good job of defending against his.

---

**How to Break Up the Banks**

Question to Hillary: As president will you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up banks?

**Hillary:**

Claims that she [has always](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-too-big-to-fail_us_569fd359e4b0875553c2a298) said “no bank is too big to fail, [no executive too powerful to jail](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/02/clinton_backtracks_on_no_individual_too_big_to_jail.html)”. Claims Sanders has just started talking about [Dodd-Frank](https://berniesanders.com/bank-reform-five-years-later-still-incomplete/) and promises to break up any banks that fail under Dodd-Frank. Shows basic grasp of Dodd-Frank’s use and reminds public that she [spoke out against](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=77069) Wall Street during her time as NY Senator. Also says that she wants to extend the law to cover [Shadow Banking](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2013/06/basics.htm). 

Question to Sanders: Why would you let banks break up themselves?

**Sanders:**

Goldman Sachs paid a [$5 billion settlement](http://fortune.com/2016/01/14/goldman-sachs-mortgage-bonds-settlement/) and addresses Clinton in saying he doesn’t need Dodd-Frank to tell him that these banks need to be broken up. 

States that the department of the treasury shouldn’t be making the decisions to break up the banks, only that they should be told when they need to break up. We need to make sure they are safe.

**Hillary:** 

She loves being in Brooklyn.

We have the authority under Dodd-Frank and she has Barney Frank’s endorsement. Agrees with Sanders. Thinks that these institutions need to be financially penalized.

Question to Sanders: Can you name one time that she took money and it influenced her decisions?

**Sanders:**

Doesn’t name a specific example [1](http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187) [2](http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/oil-companies-donated-clinton-foundation-while-lobbying-state-department-2348832) [3](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-sainato/hillary-clinton-touted-fr_b_8564764.html) [4](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/h-a-goodman/if-hillary-clinton-isnt-influenced-by-wall-street-cash_b_9165672.html) [5](http://billmoyers.com/story/elizabeth-warren-recalls-a-time-when-big-donors-may-have-changed-hillarys-vote/), but questions the integrity of taking money from companies who have destroyed our economy.

**Hillary:**

We have a law to break up under the banks and we have to use it and include Shadow Banks.

**Sanders:**

“Secretary Clinton ‘called them out’, oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.” Although he doesn’t directly give an example, he brings into question the sincerity that these corporations will pay you money to be strict on them and just because there is no proof you changed a position doesn’t mean you don’t have a conflict of interest. If elected president I will break them up.

Question to Hillary: Will you release the transcripts, especially if there is nothing that will implicate you? 

**Hillary:**

There isn’t an issue, I get money from them and will be hard on them. Repeats weathered attack that Sanders [voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2016/02/05/3746742/clinton-sanders-derivatives-regulation/). 

Question to Hillary: What about the transcripts?

**Hillary:** 

This is a new expectation. If everyone does it I will. There has always been an expectation for presidential candidates to release their transcripts, why doesn’t he?

Question to Hillary: You are running for the democratic nominee. Democratic voters want this. Will you release them?

**Hillary:**

When everyone does. What about Sanders’ tax returns?

**Sanders:**

I will release all of my transcripts. Oh wait, [there aren’t any](https://berniesanders.com/urgency-moral-economy-reflections-anniversary-centesimus-annus/). And yes, I will [release my taxes](https://go.berniesanders.com/page/-/Bernie%20Taxes%20Full.pdf). I’ve been a little busy running for president. I don’t want to get anyone excited, they are very boring, I’m [one of the poorer members of the Senate](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-hes-one-poorer-members-united-/).

**Sanders’s Score: 7/10**

Shows understanding of how to break up the banks and the candidates largely agree with each other. Fails to present an example of money changing Hillary’s stance on a matter, but effectively reminds the public that isn’t exactly the problem. The problem is she shouldn’t be taking money from these kinds of companies in the first place. Mocks Hillary’s go-to statement of telling Wall Street to “cut it out”. Promises to release tax returns.

**Hillary’s Score: 5/10**

Shows working knowledge of how to break up the banks. Continues to stick behind weak arguments of her trustworthiness and continuously circles around, evades, places blame and points the finger to get away from answering the question. The argument is further weakened when she opens the floor for Sanders to promise to release all of his transcripts and tax returns.

---

**Big Businesses**

Question to Sanders: How would effectively promote businesses around the world.

**Sanders**

He would tell Verizon’s CEO to start negotiating with their workers. This is a perfect example of the corporate greed rampant in America. Proceeds to lay out the many ways he believes the Verizon CEO is corrupt. 

Corrects the leading part of the question by stating he does not hold large businesses in contempt. Outsourcing jobs, cutting the workforce, and effectively paying no money in taxes are things we cannot allow. 

Question to Sanders: How will you bring back jobs without affecting the cost of goods?

**Sanders:**

Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. We will end up paying a little bit more for goods but we cannot let that outweigh the benefit of adding more good-paying jobs.

**Hillary:**

References her [comprehensive plan](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/11/30/clinton-infrastructure-plan-builds-tomorrows-economy-today/) to create more jobs and the plan [she revealed in Syracuse](http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/blogs/vote-up/2016/04/01/clinton-tout-record-upstate-tour/82499154/), and her role in [increasing American exports](http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/20121120amcham.html) while working as Secretary of State. 

Question to Hillary: As president, if congress gave you $15 an hour bill, would you sign it?

**Hillary:**

Of course. [She has supported the fight for $15 minimum wage](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-speaks-favorably-about-12-minimum-wage/) and claims that she did [in the Senate](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s2514/text) as well.

**Sanders:**

Points out ludicrous flip-flop of Clinton on the $15 minimum wage, [he has always supported it](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/pay-workers-a-living-wage-act?inline=file) and notes how history has outpaced her.

**Clinton:**

Doubles down that [she has always supported $15 minimum wage](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/15/bernie-s/does-hillary-clinton-want-15-or-12-minimum-wage/). Says she supported it in LA, Seattle, and NY. Urges most states will personally make the decision to raise higher than $12 an hour.

**Sanders:**

Reiterates that he introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage. Hits talking points about income inequality.

**Sanders’ Score: 8/10**

Is honest with how his plans could affect the price of goods and exemplifies that he has a clear way to attack big businesses without alienating all big businesses as a whole as “evil”. Effectively denounces Clinton’s stance on supporting $15 minimum wage. Loses track at the end but overall does well to put Clinton on the defensive.

**Hillary’s Score: 6/10**

Brings up great points about her efforts to increase job creation but doesn’t go into any detail while making it a point against Sanders that he doesn’t go into detail enough. Fumbles on a question of minimum wage and puts into question her honesty and flip-flopping over the issues. Doesn’t do a good enough job of silencing the doubters by using LA and NY as a defense.

---

**Gun Restrictions**

Question to Clinton: Are you seriously blaming Vermont and Sanders for gun violence in NY?

**Hillary:**

Laughs at the question and then attacks Sanders for laughing at her attacking him. 

No, but we need a president that will fight for [common sense gun safety laws](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/13/democrat-town-hall-hillary-clinton-says-more-gun-control-the-answer-to-gang-related-gun-violence/). Reminds public he [voted against the Brady Bill 5 times](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-voted-against-brady/) and once against brings up biased NY Daily News interview and again claims that [he is responsible for the deaths of the Sandy Hook victims](http://usuncut.com/politics/clintons-sandy-hook-attack-backfires/). 

**Sanders:**

Questions why she would put out that ad in the first place. Reminds public that he [lost an election](http://www.salon.com/2015/10/10/what_bernies_gun_control_critics_get_wrong_partner/) because of his negative stance on guns, and says he is the only Democratic candidate that can bring together a consensus on gun control and not be taking away 2nd Amendment rights.

Question to Clinton: Why did you put out that ad against Sanders?

**Clintons:**

Because most of these guns do come from out of state. States where gun laws are laxer. Points out that he won his next election [with the help of the NRA](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-has-been-largely-ve/) and a large supporter of the NRA.

Question to Sanders: Do you owe an apology to the victims of Sandy Hook?

**Sanders:**

We need to make sure guns don’t get into the hands of those who shouldn’t have them. And he doesn’t think that gun manufacturers should be sued for selling a gun in a completely law-abiding and common sense way, but when gun shop owners knowingly sell guns to someone with reasonable suspicion should and can be held accountable.

I support their right to sue.

**Hillary:**

Reiterates previous argument. Claims that [stricter laws exist for toy gun manufacturers than for real guns](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/hillary-clinton/new-york-debate-clinton-says-us-has-higher-account/). Says that people like Sanders made it hard for NY to pass legislation to prevent gun violence.

**Sanders:**

Ends by reminding the crowd that he promoted gun laws in Vermont before there were any.

**Sanders and Clinton Score: 7/10**

While Sanders and Clinton seem to draw a difference in one specific issue regarding gun laws, they overall are not that different on the issue and both failed to draw any stark differences other than repeated attacks and defenses from previous debates. If you think that gun manufacturers should be sued no matter what you side with Clinton. If you think that gun manufacturers should only be sued when they knowingly sell to people or in cases where they shouldn’t, then you side with Sanders.

The argument between them usually comes down to this:
Sanders Supporter: Should I sue Ford if I’m ran over?
Clinton Supporter: Cars aren’t designed to kill.

**The 1994 Crime Bill**

Question to Clinton: Do you think [the 1994 crime bill](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr3355/text) you supported was a net positive or a mistake?

**Clinton:**

It had some positive aspects to it. Violence against women act is one of them. There were positive and negative actions. Sentences were too long and states took control. I am going to end over-mass-incarceration. Sanders voted for the same bill.

Question to Clinton: Do you regret your support of the bill?

**Clinton:**

My husband was the president when the bill passed and he supported it. I’m sorry for the unfortunate and unintended consequences. This is why my first speech was about this. That’s why I want white people to know that systemic racism exists.

Question to Sanders: Why did you call out the Clintons for their use of the term [“Super-predators”](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/11/black_lives_matter_activist_bill_clintons).

**Sanders:**

Because it was racist. We have a broken criminal justice system, [more people in jail than any other country on earth](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/06/prisons/html/nn2page1.stm), and the media doesn’t talk about how many African Americans there are in our jail system. We should invest in jobs and education for minorities, not jailing them. 

**Clinton:**

I agree with Sanders. We also need to be investing in early education. 

Question to Sanders: How are you going to make sure that that the U.S. doesn’t lead the world in mass incarceration after you first term as president?

**Sanders:**

Work with states to get people out of jail. This is something that conservatives also agree on. We will make sure that people are released from jail and get the help that the need acclimating back into life.

**Sanders’ Score: 7/10**

Reached out from the question of mass incarceration and addressed the overall issue of how our system affects minorities. Investing in the futures of minorities needs to be more important than bringing them to heel. Failed to fully address how his plans to reduce the minority population in jail would work but brought up that this is an area where he could reach support from both parties.

**Hillary’s Score: 7/10**

Beat around the bush when it came to addressing her mistaken support for the crime bill but semi-effectively pushed some of that blame onto Sanders for his support as well. Didn’t take advantage of the time she was given to lay out talking points for her plans in investing in education and how she would accomplish anything she said.

**Energy and the Environment**

Question to Hillary: How has Sanders lied about your record in relation to the fossil fuel industry?

**Clinton:**

References her time in the Senate and how she [addressed climate change](http://correctrecord.org/hillary-clinton-protecting-the-environment/) and claims that her only donations are [from workers in the fossil fuel industry](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-bundlers-fossil-fuel_us_55a8335ee4b04740a3df86c5) and that they are [close to that of Sanders](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/apr/01/sorting-out-clintons-fossil-fuel-contributions/). 

**Sanders:**

Contributions from workers are one thing, but lobbyist bundles do count. And they donate to you because they like your stance on the issues. This is a global crisis. If we were attacked tomorrow everyone would be worried, but we do have an enemy and it is climate change. We need a [tax on Carbon](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=16117), something that Clinton does not support.

**Clinton:**

She worked on this issue as Secretary of State. I was disappointed that Sanders attacked our [meeting of 195 countries](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era) saying that it was not enough.

**Sanders:**

As Secretary of State you also [pushed fracking](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/09/hillary-clinton-fracking-shale-state-department-chevron). We have got to lead the world, we need the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry. She doesn’t support a tax on Carbon, I do.

**Clinton:**

Obama made some great steps. The president did a good job. It’s easy to diagnose a problem but harder to do something about it.

Question to Clinton: Why have you changed your view on fracking?

**Clinton:** 

She doesn’t think that she changed her stance on fracking [1](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/14/how-hillary-clintons-tone-has-shifted-on-fracking/) [2](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/03/hillary-clinton-debate-fracking) but instead that she offers fracking as a bridge into clean and renewable energy sources. And this will get us off of a crash course usage of coal and references the [current issue in Russia](http://energytransition.de/2015/01/coal-needs-a-phase-out-in-russia-and-beyond/). Claims that natural gas is a bridge but that it is an urgent matter. Raises her proposal for [500 million solar panels](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/).

**Sanders:**

This is our difference. Incrementalism doesn’t work with such a serious problem. Hillary Clinton [actively supported Fracking around the world](http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/03/hillary-supported-fracking-in-africa-now-opposes-it-in-us/). Their short term profits are not more important than the health of our world. Will you (addressing Hillary) support a tax on carbon?

**Clinton:**

I’m going to build on Obama’s work. This is why we need to support Obama’s Supreme Court Justice Nominee. I want to do what will actually make progress. 

Question to Sanders: Won’t your proposals drive us back to dependency on oil and undermine your policy?

**Sanders:**

Our legislation understands that there will be economic relocation. There will be people that lose their jobs, that’s why we build a safeguard for those people. It’s not their fault but we must move fast and be bold.

Question to Sanders: With the energy sources that you propose to cut out, how can we make up that loss?

**Sanders:**

You don’t cut it all out at once. I introduced legislation for [10 million solar rooftops](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2901). We can put people to work building these systems. We need to move with the same sense of urgency that FDR did with Nazism.

**Sanders’ Score: 8/10**

Effectively called into question why Clinton’s donations from certain industries weaken her credibility, attacked her and forced the issue about how she won’t [support a Carbon Tax](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/we-need-an-energy-miracle/407881/), stated her sense of urgency was not good enough and the wall of pragmatism won’t cut it when dealing with global warming, and forced her on the issue of fracking and her support of it around the world. Failed to lay out a more detailed explanation of how he would prevent the lack of energy sources, reliance on certain energy sources for the time being, and job loses, but kept it honest and reminded the people that he has legislation to address these issues.

**Hillary’s Score: 6/10**

Doesn’t do the best job of refuting that she takes donations from these companies and cites articles that failure to cover the entire picture but mentions Sanders as a defense to muddy the water. Starts to blunder and attacks Sanders for having too high of standards and pushes her defense to Obama. Attempts to argue she hasn’t change her stance on Global Warming but makes a solid argument that we need something to bridge the way into clean energy. Something that Sanders didn’t effectively address or counter-attack her on. Starts to lose track of the conversation near the end.

**National Security and Foreign Policy**

Question to Clinton: [Obama says worst mistake was not preparing for Libya aftermath](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/obamas-worst-mistake-libya/478461/). Don’t you also hold responsibility for that as Secretary of State?

**Clinton:**

I think we did a lot to help the Libyan people. Helped them [hold two successful elections](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13755445), we helped get rid of their [chemical weapon stockpile](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/world/africa/libyas-cache-of-toxic-arms-all-destroyed.html), and helped them set up their government. They didn’t want to accept our troops but they couldn’t protect themselves. Which led to the current situation.

**Sanders:**

According to the NYT, Obama had a hard time making a decision and you [pushed him over the edge](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/opinion/us-policy-on-libya-hillary-clinton-and-obamas-roles.html). This is the same mentality that pushed us into going to Iraq. The president noted that we didn’t think about the day after. Regime change has unintended consequences.

**Clinton:**

There was a vote in the Senate to go to the UN and [Sanders supported it](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-resolution/85/text). We did what we needed to do to prevent it from getting as bad as Syria is right now.

**Sanders:** 

Clinton has already said this before in previous debates and just repeating it doesn’t make it any more true. I supported their move towards democracy, don’t confuse that with your search for active regime change.

**Clinton:**

We did what we needed to do and I supported the president’s decision. I sought out the opinions of as many people as I could and together we arrived at this tough decision. But we were stopped by the Libyans obstructionism. 

**Sanders:**

Yes, 100-0 voted for democracy in Syria. But I would not move actively towards regime change without thinking of the consequences. You keep referring to Barack Obama a whole lot tonight, but you supported a no-fly zone [1](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/12/hillary-clintons-insane-plan-for-a-no-fly-zone.html) [2](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Despite-Pentagon-concerns-Clinton-doubles-down-on-Syria-no-fly-zone-437873) [3](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-calls-no-fly-zones-syria) [4](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-syria-islamic-state.html) [5](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/democrats-arent-on-board-with-hillarys-no-fly-zone-plan/) and President Obama did not. It will costs us tons of money, runs the risk of getting us sucked into war, we need to fight ISIS first and Assad second.

**Clinton:**

Sanders has supported my point. We trained and armed Syrian figures so they could defend themselves. People who work for the president suggest ideas and the President gets to do what he wants with them.

Question to Sanders: Do you think we spend too much on NATO?

We pay for [about 75%](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-every-nato-member-spends-on-military-in-2014-2015-2?r=UK&IR=T) of NATO’s costs. I believe the other countries of Europe should pick up some of the burden.

Question to Sanders: How is your view on NATO different from Trump’s view.

**Sanders:** 

 Ask Trump.

I think with all of the areas we have to focus on in our own country we can ask them to contribute their fair share. As president I would tell them to pay their fair share.

**Clinton:**

I agree with Sanders, but NATO has seen incredible success. We need to improve it to address terrorism. We can ask them to give more but if they don’t we don’t just dissolve it.

Question to Clinton: If they don’t agree to pay more, what would you do?

**Clinton:**

I will stay in NATO. [Most of the soldiers that died in Afghanistan were from NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_casualties_in_Afghanistan). They came to our defense after 9/11. Think of the tragedy we would be in if [NATO didn’t stop Russia](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-unleashed-stopping-russia-its-tracks-12363) from conquest in that region.

Question to Sanders: What do you say to those that argue Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?

**Sanders:**

I have spent months of my life living there. They have a right to defend themselves and live in peace. Israel has every right to defend itself, but was the [attack in Gaza disproportionate](https://theintercept.com/2016/04/09/israelis-attack-defend-bernie-sanders-saying-israels-mass-killing-civilians-wrong/)? Yes. If we want that area to become peaceful, we have to treat the Palestinians with respect and dignity. Gaza unemployment is too high, the area is decimated, we need to help them and that doesn’t make me anti-Israel.

Question to Clinton: Do you agree with Sanders? Were the attacks disproportionate?

**Clinton:**

I was there [Nov. 2012 working with Israel and Hamas](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-conflict.html), I can tell you right now. They do not seek or invite these types of attacks. Explains story of her experiencing these events. You can’t run a country with constant attacks and threats. We need to continue to reach a two state solution (proceeds to talk over time).

**Sanders:**

No one is suggesting that Israel invites missiles upon them, you evaded the question. Was their response disproportionate?

**Clinton:**

I think I did. Hamas took over Gaza and now we have a terrorist haven.

**Sanders:**

I read your [speech before APEC](http://www.ncapec.org/docs/Publications/APEC%20Women%20and%20the%20Economy%20Summit.pdf) and I heard nothing about the Palestinian people in that speech. There will never be long term peace unless the U.S. plays an even hand in helping.

**Clinton:**

Describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it, I have the experience and the first-hand knowledge and I was there in small meetings and I did care about the Palestinian people (proceeds to go over time).

**Sanders:**

If we are to pursue peace, then we have to admit Netanyahu is not always right. It’s a complicated issue and we cannot continue to be one-sided.

**Sanders’ Score: 7/10**

Calls Clinton out for the lack of foresight on Libya, weak attack on his Senate vote, he support of a no-fly zone, and presents a compassionate view to this argument that is not often seen. Doesn’t take enough time to bolster his side of the argument while focuses mainly on attacks. Presents contentious stance on NATO but defends himself relatively well. 

**Clinton’s Score: 8/10**

Does an incredibly job of bringing up her experience and working knowledge of the issues at hand while not drifting off topic. Has a weak stance on what to do with NATO if they don’t meet her demands but handles it semi-effectively. Recognizes that Sanders understands the topic but doesn’t have the level of experience that she does and that saying one thing is one aspect but accomplishing it is much harder. But throws a weak opening attack on Sanders that allows him more time to argue his points and her abysmal idea of a no-fly zone is left undefended on her part.

**College, Healthcare, and SS**

Question to Sanders: How do you plan to pay for your college and healthcare proposals?

**Sanders:**

I disagree with your figures, many [economists have come up with different numers](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-senator-bernie-sanderss-tax-proposals/full). Every other major company is able to accomplish this and [my plan](https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/) will save middle class families many thousands of dollars. Damn right I want to make public colleges tuition free. I will pay for that [by taxing Wall Street speculation](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file). We have a large student debt and a large income inequality problem and I will address that.

**Clinton:**

Before there was ObamaCare there was [HillaryCare](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/23/hillarycare-failed-but-hillary-clinton-reminds-voters-she-tried/) and college does need to be more affordable. If you run for president the numbers need to add up, and his plan has been called a [Train Wreck for the Poor](https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/washington-post-sanderss-single-payer-is-a-trainwreck-for-the-poor/). If someone promises you something for free you read the fine print.

**Sanders:**

You know what Clinton says? How she can’t stand up to big money… other countries are able to do this cheaper than we can. I live next to Canada, it’s not a communist/ authoritarian country they are doing pretty well. Same thing with college. If many other major countries can do this then don’t tell me we can’t.

**Clinton:**

We both want universal healthcare. That’s why I support Obama’s ACA. I don’t want to have Republicans repeal it or start another contentious debate. 

Question to Clinton: Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income?

**Clinton:**

I will make the wealthy pay, if that is the way we pursue then we will but there are other ways. We can tax passive income. I led the fight against Bush (cannot find a source) trying to privatize SS, but we also have to extend the trust fund. Women have been left out, we need more benefits for those women left out.

**Sanders:**

You didn’t answer the question. What you talked about was my legislation. I have to admit, I’m doing what Obama wanted to do in 2008. Do you support lifting the cap?

**Clinton:**

[I have been supporting it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/12/clinton-is-open-to-raising-social-security-taxes-on-six-figure-earners/). The other side wants to privatize it.

**Sanders:**

I’m surprised to hear that, I’m glad that you are just now joining the fight.

**Clinton:**

I want to get a Democratic Congress.

**Sanders:**

Do you or do you not support a lift on the cap to extend SS benefits?

**Clinton:**

I support the best solution. If you don’t agree with Sanders he just calls you a part of the establishment.

Question to Clinton: if elected, will you ask the president to withdraw his nomination for Supreme Court?

**Clinton:** 

I’m not going to contradict the president. I fully support the president. The Senate needs to immediately respond.

**Sanders:**

It’s amazing the level of obstructionism by the Republicans. I strongly support his nomination, but I will ask him to withdraw his nomination if elected president. I want to make sure that anyone I nominate will overturn Citizens United. 

**Clinton:**

I agree with Sanders. 

This is our 9th debate and we haven’t had a single question about a women’s rights to make her own decision about her body. And [Sanders said that Trump’s statement about abortion](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/03/31/hmm-thats-strange-why-would-clinton-use-trump-abortion-remarks-attack-sanders) was a distraction of the issues. We also need to defend Planned Parenthood. 

**Sanders:** 

I have a [100% voting record on women’s rights](https://votesmart.org/interest-group/1016/rating/4759?p=2&of=) and I will take on the Republicans when they try and take away women’s rights and LGBT rights.

**Sanders’ Score: 7/10**

Again defends the claims that his ideas won’t work (although it could have been done more effectively), continues to keep Clinton on the defensive as she has most of the debate, but presents a tough argument on asking to withdraw Obama’s choice for Supreme Court without strengthening his reasoning.

**Clinton’s Score: 5/10**

Abysmal showing for most of this portion of the debate. It genuinely seems as if Hillary Clinton is not aware that fact checking can be done about her statements. Dodges more questions. Flips on another issue. But ends powerfully by bringing up a talking point that has not been mention in the debates but leaves it on a sour note when she makes a tasteless attack on Sanders that she has already previously revoked when she could have ended on a stronger note by cementing just how important Women’s rights are to her.

**Who's a Democrat?**

Question for Sanders: Are you a Democrat?

**Sanders:**

Why would I be running for president under the Democratic Party?

I good thing to bring up is that I am beating Hillary’s margin of victory over Republican front-runners [1](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html) [2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html) [3](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_cruz_vs_sanders-5742.html) [4](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_cruz_vs_clinton-4034.html) [5](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_kasich_vs_sanders-5817.html) [6](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_kasich_vs_clinton-5162.html). The reason behind that is because there are a whole lot of independents in this country. We are not going to win with long-term established DEM voters. I have supported Democratic members and will got young people out to vote.

Question to Sanders: Why haven’t you financially supported more members of the Democratic Party?

**Sanders:**

The future of this party is not just raising money from wealthy campaign contributors, we need to get young people involved.

**Clinton:**

I have more votes than anyone in this race. I am putting together an inclusive campaign (talks more than a minute over allotted time).

Question to Sanders: Will you take this race to the end no matter what?

**Sanders:**

I think we are going to win. We lost in the Deep South, but we have won 7/8 last contests and we are going to win the presidency.

**Clinton:** 

Everyone out there should know I have a considerable lead in pledged delegates. My lead in pledged delegates is larger than that held by Obama over myself in 2008. In addition to winning states in the deep south we have also won in (proceeds to list of states, some of which are southern states), I’m not taking any voter or state for granted.

**Sanders:**

The reason we have won the past few states in large numbers is because the “youth” are tired of establishment politics. You can’t take money from big money interests and expect to not answer to them someday. 

**Sanders’ Score: 7/10**

Answered leaning question in a strong way, failed to fully touch on why he doesn’t support more Democrats, and once again partially alienated the deep south votes that he did not win. But presents multiple strong arguments that he is a stronger candidate than Clinton in the G.E.

**Hillary’s Score: 7/10**

Uses her allotment of votes up until this point to show she is more popular and pleads the for unification of the party and her past and future voters.

---

**Who Won?** (Sanders = 64) vs. (Clinton = 59)

Even forgetting the point totals above and my bias towards the candidate I support, it’s clear that Sanders won this debate.

He had a weak start but focused on his message of hope beating her message of pragmatism, consistently reminded the public that his ideas are not so “pie-in-the-sky”, and kept her on the defense for a large portion of the debate. 

On the other hand, Clinton didn’t do a strong enough job of bringing her experience into the broader scope of the arguments, flip-flopped on a key issue or two, got called out by nearly all of her less than respectable attacks, and most importantly, seemed to think that what she said during the debate could not be fact-checked. In my view, she genuinely seemed to pretend that some of the false arguments/ points she made would not be assessed for credibility.

For these reasons, I’m giving the debate to Sanders.","2016-04-16 21:44:36","25","9","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4f3v7g/who_won_the_ny_democratic_debate/","True","Spydar05","1747851754.106591","climate justice","manual"
