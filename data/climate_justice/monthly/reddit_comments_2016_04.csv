"d1w7cti","t3_4e1mnl","4e1mnl","politics","unknown","I think he has the best plan out of all of the candidates but I wish he was a bit more open to nuclear. I don't think it's a panacea but I do think the crisis facing our planet is so dire that unless we take some risks with nuclear energy we could miss some critical thresholds beyond which there might not be much for us to do. There are many positive climate feedback loops, very few meaningful negative loops.

I'm not convinced, however, that if we priced into nuclear the risks and costs of containment that it would be much cheaper than developing renewables. ","2016-04-09 15:22:29","19","kivishlorsithletmos","1747851744.367517","climate justice","manual"
"d1wl844","t3_4e1mnl","4e1mnl","politics","unknown",">100% renewable energy (no fossil fuels or nuclear) national grid by 2050

Like his economic plan, he finds a professor with extremely idealistic ideas and uses it as his sole 'proof'. 

It is rather risky to place this much confidence in a single professor's idea without large consensus from other experts, especially concerning something as crucial as energy. The issue with going 100% renewable are very clear.

>It’s actually a mix of solutions matched to each region, consisting overall of well-designed grids integrating diverse mixes of renewable energy technologies (onshore wind, offshore wind, concentrated solar (CSP), rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), utility-scale solar PV, hydroelectric, geothermal, wave and tidal), load-leveling policies and technologies, hydroelectric generation used as variable ‘peaking’ capacity, careful capacity planning based on geography-specific wind and solar yields, long distance grid interconnections and a modest amount of storage (pumped hydro, CSP with storage, other thermal storage, hydrogen, etc). Exotic new utility-scale battery technologies are not required, but will certainly make the job easier when they become commercially viable.

This really sounds unrealistic to me. It sounds like a substantial amount of effort went into trying to find a solution to the intermittency problem using all these specific combinations of renewables, probably based on climate models which are not perfect.

Nuclear power has a very safe track record, and modern reactor designs will be even safer. Why not use it? France has no problem being largely nuclear powered. I just don't understand his problem with it. There are lots of options for storing spent fuel at a central location. In fact, Yucca Mountain was a great option, but was shut down for purely political reasons. People also seem to ignore the fact that we've had nuclear power for decades (electricity in the US is about 20% from nuclear).

"d1w9jyy","t3_4e1mnl","4e1mnl","politics","unknown","I'm 100 percent against phasing out Nuclear.  100 percent renewable energy by 2050 isn't happening.  It could happen if we spent trillions and trillions of dollars but that would be highly inefficient.  You don't make a good argument for the intermittency issue - it is a far from settled engineering problem.  You didn't even address transmission issues - it would cost at least 10 trillion dollars to build transmission lines to carry solar power from Nevada to the East Coast.  

This is a well thought out post, but Sanders energy plan would be a complete disaster for the US and Global economy.  Just ending fossil fuel subsidies alone would eliminate millions of jobs and destroy the economy for many states.  There are strong geopolitical, economic and environmental incentives for us to transition to natural gas, which is what we have done.  The US now contributes less to climate change than China because we ramped up natural gas.  

If we want to talk about energy policy and climate change the real issue is the developing world.  Palm oil burning contributes more GHG than the US.  India is going to burn so much coal that they flood Bangladesh and then ask the US and Europe to pay for it.  The world's forests are being clear cut in the developing world.  The simple truth is that the planet cannot sustain 13 (or even 10) billion people living like Westerners.  We need to put our thumb on the scale while we still maintain the hegemony of the petrodollar and force the developing world to modernize their economy and institute population control protocols.

Yes, I notice that I changed the referencing of Hillary Clinton from Hillary to Clinton.

I have presented the random stats just above because many people argued that Hillary said 9/11 all the time, she spoke too much over her allotted time, used Obama as a crutch, harshly and unnecessarily criticized Sanders laugh, or interrupted too often. So here are the figures to assess those claims.","2016-04-16 21:45:19","9","Spydar05","1747851754.500105","climate justice","manual"
"d25t16d","t3_4f3v7g","4f3v7g","politics","unknown","I would disagree on your scoring in the energy sector. Sanders may have won on greenie soundbites about the problem but failed miserably at understanding how to actually solve anything.

Carbon markets have been very inefficient. Acting like supporting a carbon tax is worthy of constant refrain is woefully ignorant. A carbon market was a tumultuous failure in the EU, it was a failure in Australia, it has been a failure at a state/regional level. And carbon markets raise significant additional problems in industry and manufacturing that I doubt he has solutions ready for. The fact that Clinton doesn't support a unilateral American carbon tax is not the attack on her stance that he wants it to be.

The most damning aspect of Sanders's response in this section is when he proclaims it must happen yesterday and attacks Clinton for incrementalism, then acknowledges 'Well it has to happen slowly and in increments.' 

So basically...he acknowledges when forced to that Clinton's statements are the only feasible approach but doesn't want to face the reality that there is no quick and easy idealistic response.

He showed that he has his fingers in his ears on the current state of energy in society.

On the whole money from fossil fuels. It is such a joke. 1) We can all agree that she hasn't accepted money from fossil fuel companies. So let's address the lobbyist bundlers. Her top bundler with associations to fossil fuels was Heather Podesta (ex-wife of Clinton's campaign manager's brother.) 

Podesta raised $379,000 for Clinton. Her lobbying firm has two fossil fuel industry clients, Marathon Oil and Oxbow (coal company). Together, they paid $220,000 for Podesta's services. Podesta has yearly revenue of $7.6 million and 42 clients including Toyota, Red Bull, Cigna, DeVry University, FitBit, and Home Depot.

Even better, Heather Podesta has accepted MORE money from renewable energy clients Brookfield power and Fuels America ($690,000 combined) than she has from her fossil fuel clients.

So to say that the money Heather raised for Clinton demonstrates that Clinton is accepting money from fossil fuels is an absolute joke.

This sort of barely there attempt to connect Clinton to the fossil fuel industry is just a red herring.
