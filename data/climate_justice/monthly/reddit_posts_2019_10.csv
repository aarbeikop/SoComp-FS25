"dovol7","politics","unknown","I am Chris Armitage, Progressive Democrat, Air Force Vet, former cop, and comic running for Congress. AMA!","My main policies are Medicare for All / Green New Deal / and the Armitage Income Justice Act which addresses Income Inequality. I also believe that we need to get corporate money out of politics, which is a uniting sentiment regardless of political affiliation.

The 5th district is in Eastern Washington State and is 25% larger than New Jersey. In 2018 the 5th was recognized as a flippable district on the Red to Blue list. I am running to replace 7 term Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R) who has a record of voting in line with Trump 95% of the time.

While Active Duty Air Force I earned a Master’s of Science in Homeland Security and an Undergrad in Criminal Justice, both were partially earned during my two Middle East deployments. I am also heavily involved as a climate activist and a member of the LGBT Community. 

This campaign is not accepting any corporate contributions. Although many folks feel that this district can't be won without corporate or lobbyist money, we believe that the power of individual donors is the key to showing people that their voices actually matter!

Edit* thanks for the great questions! I am headed to an open mic. Consider contributing if you agree that grassroots funding is the right way to fund a campaign!

"djpooe","politics","unknown","I'm Agatha Bacelar, the millennial challenging Nancy Pelosi. Our system is broken. Let's fix it. AMA.","Hi! I'm Agatha.

I'm a 27 year-old Brazilian-American immigrant, Stanford engineer, and social justice advocate. I'm running for Congress because our system is broken, and I believe a new generation of bold leadership can fix it.

We have seen the result of trusting the current political establishment to guide us into the future. Since Nancy Pelosi took office in 1989, [inequality](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/) has risen along with [the sea levels](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html). The amount of money spent on political campaigns [has skyrocketed](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/07/as-more-money-flows-into-campaigns-americans-worry-about-its-influence/). Our schools are [more segregated](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/5/17080218/school-segregation-getting-worse-data). Incarceration [has increased](https://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Trends-in-US-Corrections.pdf) upwards of 500%. An entire generation became [the first in history](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income) to be poorer than their parents.

We need people in government who embrace new ideas to solve old problems. I'm a champion of the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-All, and Universal Basic Income. I'm also hoping to bring informed, practical, and future-savvy tech regulation to the forefront of politics in Washington. One of my the areas I'm most passionate about is using emerging technology to enable a more participatory political system.

Let's build the future I know we are capable of. Ask Me Anything!
