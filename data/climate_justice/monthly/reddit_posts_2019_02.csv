"anmh43","politics","unknown","2019 State of the Union Address and Response","Tonight, President Donald Trump addressed the nation in his second annual State of the Union address. Originally scheduled for January 29, the address was delayed due to the 34 day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. Trump discussed job security, employment, taxation, border security, immigration, manufacturing, trade, infrastructure, healthcare, drug prices, the opiate crisis, abortion, space exploration, and the Middle East. A democratic response will follow the address.
