Hi Agatha, thanks for doing this AMA! I wanted to ask, why should a progressive support you over Shahid Buttar, who as far as I can tell is more progressive on most issues and is a commited leftist/socialist. 

In general, I have a lot more faith in candidates with a long-term commitment to a coherent ideology and vision of a world where the typical person is empowered and made more free.

For example, I think all of the following positions are clear to those who are commited to enacting lasting change in this direction. Which of these positions do you endorse? Of those you do not endorse, why not?

- PGE should be owned by the people of California.
- Every person should have a home. And in a city (SF) with more billionaires per capita than any other, we have no excuse for denying people homes.
- Bernie Sanders is the only serious choice for president.

You state:

> Since Nancy Pelosi took office in 1989, inequality has risen along with the sea levels. The amount of money spent on political campaigns has skyrocketed. Our schools are more segregated. Incarceration has increased upwards of 500%. An entire generation became the first in history to be poorer than their parents.
 
I agree with everything you've stated above and this is clearly backed up with original data.
  
During the 2016 Presidential Election, Candidate Donald Trump stated something similar to the above regarding Hillary Clinton's tenure as U.S Senator from 2000 to 2008.  Hillary's response was that she was one of 100 US Senators (1/100th) serving under a Republican President at the time.

Nancy Pelosi is 1/435th of the House of Representatives.  
 
Is Pelosi to blame for all of the above?  Or is it the GOP representation (i.e. Newt Gingrich, George W. Bush, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, SCOTUS, Citizens United, etc.)  over the past 26 years?
