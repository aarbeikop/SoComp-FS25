AMA!","Hello All - My name is Shahid Buttar and I'm challenging Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the CA-12 House seat in 2020, after winning more votes in 2018 than any primary challenger to Pelosi from the left in the past decade.

I'm running to bring real progressive values back to San Francisco and champion the issues that Speaker Pelosi will not. My campaign is focused on issues like Medicare-for-All, climate ＆ environmental justice, and fundamental rights including freedom from mass surveillance and mass incarceration. We’re also running to generate actual (rather than the Speaker’s merely rhetorical) resistance to the current criminal administration, as well as to end the Democratic party’s complicity in corporate corruption and abuse.

I've been working on these issues for almost 20 years as a long-time advocate for progressive causes in both San Francisco and Washington, DC. I am a Stanford-trained lawyer, a former long-time program director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a grassroots organizer, and a political artist. I am also an immigrant, a Muslim, a DJ, a spoken word artist and someone that has organized grassroots collectives across the country.
