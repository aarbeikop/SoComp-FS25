"d6mryzf","t3_4yd6dl","4yd6dl","politics","unknown","One interesting thing here to consider:  the Department of Justice memo addresses the Bureau of Prisons.  

However, the U.S. Marshals Service (also within the DOJ) also uses contract prisons.  So the question is, does this effectively end the USMS's use as well?

*[Update 1]*:  In addition, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) within DHS uses contract prisons.  How will they respond?]

*[Update 2]*:  According to Correction Corporation of America's 2015 Annual Report (10-K), Federal customers (BOP, ICE, USMS) accounted for 51% of their total revenue --- 24% from ICE, 16% from USMS, and 11% from BOP]","2016-08-18 16:31:16","34","[deleted]","1747852474.962798","climate justice","manual"

"d6muavh","t3_4yd6dl","4yd6dl","politics","unknown","I have zero way to back this up, BUT I think this is one of the first steps towards the federal legalization of marijuana. My (totally unsubstantiated) logic goes something like this:

1. Executive ends federal use of private prisons.
2. They get denied funding for new federal prisons by Congress in retaliation and in an attempt to curry favor with lobbyists.
3. Executive has no place to put prisoners, most of whom are non-violent drug offenders, due to Congress denying funding for new federal prisons.
4. Executive then argues that these overcrowded prisoners shouldn't be there in the first place since they are non-violent and there for a drug that many believe should be legal anyway.
5. With Congress leaving the Executive no recourse, they now have the hard reasoning to reschedule marijuana and pardon offenders, offering the pressure release valve needed for federal prisons since that they cannot use private prisons to share the load.

I could be WAY off, but that's how I see it going over the next several years.","2016-08-18 17:17:18","18","FranzJosephWannabe","1747852474.969067","climate justice","manual"
