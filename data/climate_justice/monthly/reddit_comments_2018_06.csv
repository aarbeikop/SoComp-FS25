"e1enszj","t3_8udp67","8udp67","politics","unknown","I blame the Democrats. The Republicans fight like hell to do what their voters want. The Democrats don’t.

The Republicans nominated an “outsider” at a time when the country hated the establishment. The Democrats nominated the embodiment of the establishment, created a perception that they were rigging it for the obvious frontrunner, and then the outsider stayed in the race way too long and further fractured the Party.

Republicans fall in line and vote for Trump in November even thought they didn’t like him. Democrats started throwing their votes away.

The Republican Party knew what the country wanted, didn’t cry and stay home when they didn’t get their way, and now they have leaders that do whatever it takes to get the things that their voters want done.

It’s a sad realization and I want to vomit sayin it, but there is only one political party in this country that does what it’s supposes to... the Republican Party.

And to everyone downvoting [l should edit this part since clearly it’s not getting downvotes]... explain where I’m wrong. Because the way I’m looking at it, the Republicans deserve everything they’ve gotten so far. Republicans don’t care about looking hypocritical, they don’t care about a ThinkProgress editorial calling them out... they care about getting shit done.","2018-06-27 22:26:48","704","Johnnycc","1747856808.413944","climate justice","manual"

And this breaking of ranks is why Democrats will always lose.

I knew on that day and mourned it. 

Through apathy, traitors, and hostile action the Supreme Courts fate was decided then. Its just taken this long for everyone else to finally realize that.

I know this doesn't help. But we cant let this demoralize us. We have to circumvent it through voting.
