"fcod5i8","t3_ei8wuj","ei8wuj","politics","unknown","Yikes. It's difficult to conceive that all of this was just in the past year.

It's no wonder that so much of the population seems totally disinterested in seeking out information and staying informed with what is going on in our country. The amount of major scandals, revelations, and conspiracies is not only entirely overwhelming, but absolutely depressing. It makes it easier to understand how people can bury their heads and prefer just believe what their preferred mainstream media outlet tells them, it must be much easier and less exhausting.

That said - as debilitating as it may be, I feel as though it's my personal responsibility to keep myself informed and come to my own conclusions. As I hope more and more people do to the best of their ability. Because, there is really only one conclusion (IMO) you can make if you are informed of all these things, that Trump and his enablers must go, in order to preserve our democracy.

Hopefully we can all be informed and rational going into 2020, exercise our voice, our right to vote, and show the rest of the world that we won't stand for what the GOP has done. That we as a country, are better than this.","2019-12-31 21:55:32","71","ASemiAquaticBird","1747860432.204458","climate justice","manual"

"fcobgvb","t3_ei8wuj","ei8wuj","politics","unknown","The GOP staged its own variation of the Reichstag Fire by doing their best to turn the Constitutionally-mandated impeachment hearings into a mockery of democracy and the rule of law.

I thought the Iran/Contra hearings were bad but watching these human beings turn themselves into screaming, drooling cartoon characters was  a next-level horror show.

Lets hope the **'clock and the calendar of 2020** comes back to clear away these villains and that someday this country can be made whole again.","2019-12-31 21:36:06","15","Ouroboros000","1747860432.210591","climate justice","manual"
