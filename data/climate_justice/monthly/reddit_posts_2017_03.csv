"5zkmmp","politics","unknown","This is Bruce Gibney, venture capitalist and former partner at a leading Silicon Valley VC firm. My new book explores the biggest unsaid reason for our country’s current political and economic problems – the Baby Boomer generation. Ask me about it!","Hi, I’m [Bruce Gibney](http://www.brucegibney.com/#about-link), former lawyer, venture capitalist and partner at Founders Fund, and now, author.
 
What happens when society is run by sociopaths?  That’s the question my book, [A Generation of Sociopaths](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/bruce-cannon-gibney/a-generation-of-sociopaths/9780316395786/) answers, analyzing the experiences, behaviors and politics of the Baby Boomers - for decades, the largest and most influential generation in America.
 
 The Boomers’ grip on power, which has lasted more than thirty years and will last for at least another half decade, not only coincided with - but caused - a series of profound disappointments: slowing economic growth, decelerating innovation, tremendous fiscal imbalances, serial financial and political scandals, environmental degradation, a toxic legacy of debt, and a surprising lack of progress on a range of social issues from income inequality to social justice.  Boomer power over society, as the largest voting bloc for decades and as a majority of the nation’s legislators since the 1990s, has been near-total, and ruthlessly devoted to the promotion of the Boomers’ short-sighted self-interest.  I recently presented a very brief summary of part of the argument in an op-ed for the Boston Globe: https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/02/26/how-baby-boomers-destroyed-everything/lVB9eG5mATw3wxo6XmDZFL/story.html
 
From the tangled history of Vietnam to bipartisan policy failures from 1980s to the present, from unprecedented imprisonment to improvident tax cuts (passed by Republicans and Democrats alike), I’m looking beyond conventional political explanations of Red vs. Blue, to the real dynamic of Old vs. Young, at how a powerful generation is grabbing national wealth while leaving subsequent generations with the bill.  
 
Ask me about:  the Baby Boomers and their effects on America; causes for slow economic growth; the entitlements crisis and its effects on the young; existential problems - climate, AI, national debt; cultural changes in attitudes towards science, technology, and elites; new demographic explanations for the election of 2016… Ask me anything!

*Signing off at 3.35 ET* Thank you for the questions all - I appreciated the chance to discuss.

"62kss7","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: Hi Reddit, we're the organizers of the March for Science, and we're here to talk about the importance of fighting for science and how you can get involved. Ask us anything!","Hey Reddit! We’re organizers from the March for Science, here to answer your questions about the March. 

The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.

The March for Science got started with a reddit discussion on /r/politics about a Scientists’ March on Washington. We scientists took that initial interest and started a website and social media accounts to start recruiting. The march quickly gained hundreds of thousands of followers on social media and became the March for Science, an event planned to take place in over 400 cities across the globe, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend.
