What do you think is the most effective way for Congress to take back their power with regards to foreign adventurism? Resend the AUMF? Slash funding for overseas military bases? Block weapon sales to dictatorships we use to do our dirty work? All of the above and/or something else?","2019-09-18 15:29:22","200","TheTaoThatIsSpoken","1747859790.1381109","climate justice","manual"

"f0owkch","t3_d5z8ye","d5z8ye","politics","unknown","That's cool you've worked for the EFF for a while, they do great work on government surveillance, but I worry they don't go far enough in trying to rein in corporate surveillance, and some have pointed out that they're largely funded by Silicon Valley (correct me if I'm wrong here), so that may be why they take a more libertarian view of things like regulation around data collection/retention.

So I have a few questions about this:

I personally believe we need regulation around 3 key areas: what types of data can be collected, how long it can be stored, and who it can be shared with.

Do you support these types of regulations, or are you more in line with EFF on this issue?

Also, what do you think of GDPR, and would it make sense to do something similar in the U.S.?

Thank you!","2019-09-18 15:51:26","57","sirfloppydisk","1747859790.144808","climate justice","manual"

Do you think you'll get any shots at a debate with Rep. Pelosi? How do you plan on getting your name out there among voters in your district that might not be exposed to an online campaign?
