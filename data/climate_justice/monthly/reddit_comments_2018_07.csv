Some more quotes about Kavanaugh:

> ""Kavanaugh has a track record of siding with religious organizations over governments and other groups that challenge them, a particularly attractive trait to conservatives. In Priests for Life v. HHS, Kavanaugh declared the Obamacare contraceptive mandate violated constitutional rights to religious liberty""

_

> ""Kavanaugh has also sided with conservatives on the issue of net neutrality, dissenting when the court upheld Obama-era net neutrality regulations, regulations requiring Internet service providers to treat websites equally.""

_

> ""Kavanaugh has also generally sided against the Environmental Protection Agency in cases over its authority to regulate — a boon for an administration that has worked to loosen or eliminate environmental regulations viewed as too burdensome.""

"e23uqwb","t3_8xiv09","8xiv09","politics","unknown","Some bullet points on his views:

- 2A Rights

 - Kavanaugh objected to a 2011 ruling that upheld Washington’s ban on semiautomatic rifles. Kavanaugh said the ban on semiautomatic rifles was unconstitutional because the weapons are in common use in this country. (Something that Heller established as a basis for being protected)

 - “Gun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding or sufficiently rooted in text, history, and tradition are not consistent with the Second Amendment individual right,” Kavanaugh wrote.

- Abortion

 - Kavanaugh dissented in the case that allowed undocumented minor to get an abortion. However, “unlike another conservative judge,” Kavanaugh “did not directly challenge her right to have an abortion under certain circumstances,”

 - Kavanaugh “told senators during his DC Circuit confirmation hearing that he’d respect precedent on abortion and declined to share his views on Roe v. Wade,”

- Gay Marriage

 - While there isn’t any readily available information on Kavanaugh’s positions on LGBTQ issues, Justin Walker, a University of Louisville law professor, told the LA Times that, “There is no guesswork with Judge Kavanaugh. He is extremely predictable,” noting that he tends to uphold court precedent…which could potentially be a good thing in terms of upholding gay marriage. 

- Obamacare Mandate

 - But Kavanaugh, while on the D.C. federal bench, is accused of helping to keep Barack Obama’s signature achievement alive in a 2011 case based on the law’s individual mandate. Kavanaugh detailed how he views the role federal courts should play, one that includes no oversight over Congress’s taxation powers. “For judges, there is a natural and understandable inclination to decide these weighty and historic constitutional questions,” Kavanaugh wrote. “But in my respectful judgment, deciding the constitutional issues in this case at this time would contravene an important and long-standing federal statute, the Anti-Injunction Act, which carefully limits the jurisdiction of federal courts over tax-related matters.”

- Environmental Protections 

 -  Kavanaugh dissented from denial of rehearing en banc in a case involving regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions. Kavanaugh resisted the agency’s attempt to adapt the language of a 1970 statute, the Clean Air Act, to permit regulation of an environmental problem that Congress did not anticipate when it enacted the statute, concluding that the EPA had “exceeded its statutory authority” when it issued the greenhouse-gas regulations. He argued that accepting the EPA’s approach would allow agencies to “adopt absurd or otherwise unreasonable interpretations of statutory provisions and then edit other statutory provisions to mitigate the unreasonableness,” and warned that “undue deference or abdication to an agency carries its own systemic costs.”

 - Kavanaugh has not always ruled against the EPA, however. In National Mining Association v. McCarthy, in 2014, he wrote a panel decision upholding an EPA program aimed at addressing the environmental effects on waterways of mountaintop-removal coal mining. And in 2010, in American Trucking Associations v. EPA, he wrote an opinion upholding the EPA’s review of California’s limits on emissions from in-use non-road engines. On occasion, a Kavanaugh opinion siding with the EPA’s opponents has been a win for environmental interests, as in Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, in 2014, in which he wrote an opinion that vacated an EPA rule establishing an affirmative defense for cement-kiln operators sued for exceeding emission limits.

- Originalism and Law interpretation

 - Kavanaugh has begun to spell out an approach to statutory interpretation, in what he explains as an effort to limit judicial activism. In a 2017 speech at Notre Dame Law School, Kavanaugh, like Roberts during his confirmation hearing, endorsed a “vision[] of the rule of law as a law of rules, and of the judge as umpire,” cautioning against allowing judges to import their policy preferences into their rulings

 - Rather than trying to decide whether a statute is ambiguous, “judges should strive to find the best reading of the statute, based on the words, context, and appropriate semantic canons of construction.""","2018-07-10 03:42:29","373","CrzyJek","1747857004.8371131","climate justice","manual"
