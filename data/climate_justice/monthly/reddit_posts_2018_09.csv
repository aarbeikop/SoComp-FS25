"9hg2yf","politics","unknown","I am Christine Hallquist, Democratic candidate for Governor of Vermont - AMA","I am Christine Hallquist, I started working on IBM’s factory floor and worked my way up to the Power Systems Operation Manager for Digital Equipment Corporation. I spent the last 12 years as CEO of Vermont’s largest electric cooperative, transforming it from a near bankrupt utility to a leader on climate change and renewable energy with a 96% carbon free grid. In 2015, I became the first CEO to ever transition on the job. I raised her three children on the Green River Reservoir where I still live and fish with my grand children. I decided to run for governor after hearing Muslim Girls Making Change discussing how Vermont is not as insulated from national hatred and bigotry as I had hoped.  I am running on a platform of rural revitalization with living wages and healthy downtowns. My four core issues are: universal healthcare, combating climate change, universal broadband and ensuring all children get a quality public education. I have always believed that nothing is impossible when you are on the side of justice.
