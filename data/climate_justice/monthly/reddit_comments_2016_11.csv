Which means the Supreme court is in the hands of a 100% controlled Republican US government.

Then Trump wins just about every battleground state (FL/OH/NC/PA/MI/WI) and proved every single poll wrong. This will be written in history books about how the polls were so wrong and how Donald fucking Trump was elected as president. 

My god, yes, President Donald Trump. It's been real, America.

"d9shex6","t3_5bzh35","5bzh35","politics","unknown","What an unexpected voter turnout. Keeping all political biases aside, I'm shocked how inaccurate the polls were - it seemed Clinton had a sure win at the beginning of the day. Not only will this election be a huge one in history, but this election day in particular as well. 

It's been a very intense, divisive, explosive, and energetic past year in American politics and culture. I'm interested in seeing how this will all play out in the next few weeks and once Trump eventually takes office.

"d9sj46p","t3_5bzh35","5bzh35","politics","unknown","Whew boy.  Still processing all of this.  Despite the urge to panic and predict doom and gloom, I think everyone who voted against Trump (because I think few people actually voted for Clinton) will have to calm down over the next few days and weeks.

The world (shouldn't) end tomorrow.  Yes we have President Trump, a Republican House and Republican Senate and (coming soon) a more conservative Supreme Court.  But I think at most what we'll see is the repeal of Obamacare, a more conservative Supreme Court, and the ignoring of global warming for another four to eight years.

But 90% of what Trump said he wants isn't going to happen.  He isn't going to be able to build a wall along thousands of miles of border.  He isn't going to be able to deport any legal immigrants and the possibility of mass deportation of illegal immigrants is low.  

But I think the people who believed that he could/would do the other things are going to be disappointed as well.  Manufacturing jobs aren't coming back.  We aren't going to rewind to where a high school graduate could get a job in an assembly plant and support a family on a single income.  Big coal jobs aren't coming back.  We aren't going to put insane tariffs on foreign goods to get countries to start buying things we make.  Unless the working class population accepts $0.20 an hour or magically turns into robots, it isn't happening.  Globalization also isn't going away.  The house of cards that is the global economy is too big and too essential to modern life as we know it.

It's going to be an interesting four years.  But we'll get through it.","2016-11-09 08:15:55","754","InvaderDJ","1747853043.69645","climate justice","manual"
