On your [issues page](https://www.christineforvermont.com/issues/), you say you want to accomplish the following regarding marijuana legislation:

> Finish progress made on marijuana legalization by taxing and regulating

> Recognize economic development opportunity and proven positive outcomes of a tax and regulate system

Governor Scott has been deliberately slow when it comes to moving forward on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, despite [polling indicating that >50% of the state wants full retail access](http://projects.vpr.net/vpr-vermont-pbs-poll). 

I think the two lines you have regarding marijuana legislation are slightly vague, and leave a lot to be interpreted. Do you support full legalization and retail availability of marijuana for recreational usage for adults over 21?","2018-09-20 15:33:18","56","TrumpImpeachedAugust","1747857457.51788","climate justice","manual"

For a lot of trans people, especially young or closeted ones who have big hopes and dreams, it seems so far-off and improbable that we might have a transgender person in a high government position. 

What advice or wisdom would you give other trans people who might have similar ambitions and aspirations, but are discouraged?","2018-09-20 15:34:47","33","sics2014","1747857457.521572","climate justice","manual"

"e6bpbfv","t3_9hg2yf","9hg2yf","politics","unknown","Hi Christine. Native Vermonter and long time Burlington resident here. As I approach my 30's I continuously feel like despite having solid well above minimum wage employment for years I just can't get ahead in the state. That for too long I've been living in conditions that I work too hard to deal with and I'm incapable of finding my footing. It's gotten so bad that my girlfriend and I have been discussing leaving the state for an area with a lower cost of living as we just don't see us ever capable of building a quality future here let alone ever having children and starting a family. 

Could you explain how you intend to make Vermont a more livable state in terms of cost of living that will keep current residents from seeking better opportunities elsewhere and hopefully attract new ones? Thank you.    ","2018-09-20 16:19:01","18","[deleted]","1747857457.5308459","climate justice","manual"

As you know, there are many cross border shoppers and tourists that come to Vermont from Canada. The U.S federal government has been threatening to permanently ban people from crossing the border if they admit that they consume or are associated with Canadian marijuana legalization and its industries.

At a state level, what can be done about this kind of threat?","2018-09-20 16:39:28","15","Hoosagoodboy","1747857457.5363991","climate justice","manual"

There is a school of thought on the left that social issues are ""identity politics"" that distract from economic issues. How do you, the first transgender nominee for a major party in a gubernatorial race, emphasize the importance of these so-called ""identity politics"" so people understand that they're not just a ""distraction""?","2018-09-20 16:48:35","7","CassiopeiaStillLife","1747857457.551507","climate justice","manual"
