"dgdh6eu","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","What are your opinions on nuclear power.

In my eyes renewable energy sources are not efficient enough to carry the energy demands of a big country. Especially those that do not benefit from solar or hydroelectric power have to rely on fossil fuels for electricity.

Nuclear power has its known risks but it can cut emissions for a low price. I think opting to combat climate change and opting against nuclear power are a combination that dont go well. I had Germany in mind when typing this. All the negatives of nuclear due to its neighbours, increased electricity prices, and increased reliance on coal. Climate change was used specifically to drive a political agenda.

What are your opinions on this.

2. If we aren't able join the march, what are other ways to support the movement? 

3. What is one of the most important things we can change about our everyday lifestyle to prevent or at least mitigate damage from climate change?","2017-04-17 13:35:28","95","kidminor","1747854151.97613","climate justice","manual"

"dgdf18w","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","How do you keep this positive, so that you don't turn the current administration against science? They already are proposing huge cuts to the budget of various scientific agencies. If they see scientists as being their enemies, they are likely to be even less supportive of science. But if they see scientists as people that provide an important foundation for economic growth (by new discoveries in technology, medicine, engineering, etc.), then perhaps they'll realize that this investment is an important one for our country. How can we direct the March in a fashion that makes this point?","2017-04-17 12:27:57","38","Scientist34again","1747854151.98238","climate justice","manual"
