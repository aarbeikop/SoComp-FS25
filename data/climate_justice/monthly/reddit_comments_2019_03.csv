"eiwhe74","t3_b31crs","b31crs","politics","unknown","you come here and introduce yourself has the gayest, do you see anything wrong with that? What if a straight GOP official said he was the most heterosexual official? 

I bet you would be offended, I mean who cares if you are gay?

Which leads me to this question. 

Gay and lesbian people are by no means free from persecution today. But it does seem the battle is changing. 

In the early 80s the goal seemed to be just to let LGBT be a part of society. Which I agree with. but then in the 90s it become LGBT should be included in media like film and television. Which I agree with. But in the 2000s it became, LGBT should have equal rights as everyone else. I agree and helped fight for that.

But now today's agenda seems to be LGBT or die. I am told there are over 70 sexes, I am told it's not OK to raise my sons like they are straight, till they identity that way. 

I guess what I am saying why must being gay or straight be good or bad? If being gay or straight is not a choice which I believe it is not. 

How about we stop shouting about nonsense and you tell us something real about yourself?

I love going down on my wife, but what does that have to do with how I might govern?

"eiwmk3x","t3_b31crs","b31crs","politics","unknown","Bay Area politics are filled to the brim with politicians using fake liberal gestures while, effectively, reducing the quality of life for poor and middle class individuals. We are worse off, not better, when you look at the housing crisis and homelessness. Instead of promoting policies that would directly improve the suffering of countless Bay Area residents, we get stuff like [Berkekey: Ohlone Territory](https://abc7news.com/society/heading-to-berkeley-thats-now-ohlone-territory/5187374/), which is a fine gesture, but that comes as just today Berkeley denied approval for a 57 unit structure. 

Berkeley isn't the only place doing this. This is a rampant issue all over the Bay, including Emeryville.

Knowing this, why do you introduce yourself as the ""youngest"" and ""gayest"" elected official? If you're actually progressive, you should be progressive enough to know that the Bay Area doesn't need more fake, liberal gestures. We need actual change from our politicians.
