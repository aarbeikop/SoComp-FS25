"ddjxart","t3_5t3sj1","5t3sj1","politics","unknown","Reading this order is a complete and utter evisceration of the government's position. Wow. 

**Point 1**. So, essentially a TRO isn't appealable. The next step up from a TRO is a preliminary injunction, which is kind of the bad ass step-dad of the TRO. Like the one who drinks all the beer and fought in Nam and stuff.


A preliminary injunction once granted will usually stay in place for the ENTIRETY of the litigation. As in, until the judge/jury rules on the actual dispute. This is a big effin deal, and as a result, the requirements for a preliminary injunction are stiff.

The court has basically said that the TRO at issue had very similar qualities to a prelim injunction, and could be treated as such for purposes of appealability. (is that even a word?)

This is important because the 9th Circuit panel essentially said that they would affirm a prelim injunction if issued along the same lines as the TRO and has implicitly given the okay to the lower court that a prelim injunction should be granted. 

**Point 2**. The states have standing. This was the majority of the argument against the states by the government. The Court goes into a very detailed explanation regarding how the states have *third-party standing.* This is good as it reaffirms the ability of states to challenge Trump's EO's. 

**Point 3**. The Government argued that the Court did not have the ability to review the executive order for various reasons. The Order shuts this the fuck down. Hard. 

> From the order:
""Instead, the Government has taken the position that the President’s decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections. The Government indeed asserts that it violates separation of powers for the judiciary to entertain a constitutional challenge to executive actions such as this one.

> *There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.* 

Also: 

> In short, although courts owe considerable deference to
the President’s policy determinations with respect to
immigration and national security, it is beyond question that
the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate
constitutional challenges to executive action.

**Point 4**. For those who listened to teh call, the Government put a lot of faith in the *Mandel* case. The Court quotes this case saying that it actually SUPPORTS their ruling and saying that, ""The Government omits portions of the quoted language to imply that this standard governs judicial review of all executive exercises of immigration authority."" 

The Feds literally deleted sections of the precedent in order to try to jury-rig support for their motion. 

**Point 5**. The Court basically said that out of the 4 requirements to issue a stay (which would stay the lower court's temporary restraining order, thereby putting the travel ban back in place), the Government failed all of them. LOL. 

**Point 6**. Due process applies to people who are not citizens. Feel free to quote this on your next Facebook argument: 

> The procedural protections provided by the Fifth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause are not limited to
citizens. Rather, they “appl[y] to all ‘persons’ within the
United States, including aliens,” regardless of “whether their 
presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.”
Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001). These rights
also apply to certain aliens attempting to reenter the United
States after travelling abroad. Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S.
21, 33-34 (1982). 

**Point 7**. Trump's inability to stick with anything longer than 140 characters bit him in the ass here: 

> Moreover, in light of the Government’s shifting interpretations of the
Executive Order, we cannot say that the current
interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative
and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these
proceedings. 

This was regarding the argument for Due Process, as the Government argued that the EO now allowed lawful permanent residents to re-enter the country, and that the argument that the EO kept out greencard holders could no longer be used. 

**Point 8**. Court states that even if you are not a lawful resident, you may have due process rights as a visa applicant with an existing relationship with a US resident or institution. This is a big deal as the more potential members of classes with due process requirements, the harder it will be to keep this EO. The EO clearly deprives people of due process. 

**Point 9**. The Court declined to limit the scope of the TRO to lawful permanent residents, and also declined to limit the geographic scope of the TRO. The stay is in effect for everyone and anywhere in the US. 

**Point 10**.  The order does reference Trump's statements regarding the Muslim ban in regards to the section of the EO that allows entry for members of a minority religion. However the Court declined to rule on the Establishment Clause argument stating: 

> The States’ claims raise serious allegations and present
> significant constitutional questions. In light of the sensitive
> interests involved, the pace of the current emergency
> proceedings, and our conclusion that the Government has
> not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on
> appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process
> claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the
> merits of this appeal have been fully briefed.

**Point 11**.

> The Government has pointed to no evidence that any
> alien from any of the countries named in the Order has 
> perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.

And in the footnote: 

> Although the Government points to the fact that Congress and the
> Executive identified the seven countries named in the Executive Order
> as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016, the Government has not
> offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security
> concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa
> requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the
> Executive Order to be immediately reinstated.

Damn. Savage. 

That's basically it for the order. This was an absolute destruction of the Government's arguments in favor of the EO. I would expect the prelim injunction to be granted in the lower level court, which would then be appealed to the 9th Circuit. If affirmed, I would then expect that order to appealed to the Supreme Court. Trump will likely want to wait until Gorsuch is confirmed, but given his recent comments, that might not even matter. 

EDIT - This has gotten a lot of attention. Thank you! And thank you to the two kind individuals for the gilding. I'd like to take the moment to shout-out a subreddit I recently created that will hopefully be used to answer legal questions about current or past events. You can find it here: /r/AskLawQuestions/. Looking for lawyers to answer questions and for people to provide them. Think of this as being in the same vein as /r/askhistorians or /r/askscience.
