"b31crs","politics","unknown","I'm one of the Bay Area's youngest, gayest and most progressive elected officials and I take no prisoners so bring your best! AMA.","I am the former Mayor and a current Council Member in the small but mighty city of Emeryville, CA! In my elected capacity I serve on multiple regional boards, including the Alameda County Transportation Commission, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and Alameda County Lead Poisoning Prevention Agency. I have been very outspoken in the Bay Area on a variety of issues, including homelessness, transit, community safety and climate change.


I have worked for the past 7 years as a nonprofit policy director and statewide expert on homelessness interventions and criminal justice reform. Prior to that, I spent 8 years as an attorney in Chicago, where I defended tenants of the Chicago Housing Authority's Cabrini Green Public Housing Project in criminal and eviction jury trials. I started my legal career as a street outreach attorney for the homeless. I have fought to end the criminalization of poverty and homelessness my entire career.


I love bourbon, bow ties, board games, and boyfriends... like King - my 16 year old rescue dog. I look forward to answering any and every question you can come up with, so don't hold back! AMA!
