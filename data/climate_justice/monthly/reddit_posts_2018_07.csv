"8xiv09","politics","unknown","Megathread: President Trump nominates Judge Brett Kavanaugh as next US Supreme Court Justice","President Donald Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge in Washington to succeed Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.

Kavanaugh serves on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which often rules on major challenges to federal laws and policies. If confirmed, he would make the Supreme Court solidly conservative, joining Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch — providing a five-vote majority.
