1kdqjeo,climatechange,Actual effects of climate change,"Want to start of by saying I absolutely believe in climate change, but a few things I dont really understand well.

So I'm just looking for any experts or redditors educated on the subject to tell me is it really as bad as they say? And what could be some *actual* life changing events that could arise from it, and when are we expecting this to start?

I also have a friend who doesn't believe in climate change and says it's just normal cycles of the planet (warming and cooling), how can I disprove this to him? He also points to the fact you can go to a random year in the 20th century and find crazy hot temperatures like we see today.

1kfip1o,climatechange,How climate change threatens retirement for millenials,"This Business Insider story on [""Millenial Retirement Panic""](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-of-millennial-retirement-panic-boomer-parents-saving-401k-market-2025-5) makes an important point about what climate change could do to Millenials' retirement plans:

>  
For me, it was the climate crisis — and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning — that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040 — the year I turn 60 — as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy. At the highest projected temperatures, they estimated, GDPs would plummet by 30% by 2080 in every country they modeled, including the United States.

>After the panel, I asked one of the presenters, Willemijn Verdegaal, what I should do to prepare for retirement, assuming the Earth stays on its current warming trajectory. ""In all honesty,"" she told me, ""there's very little point in you saving anything anymore.""",2025-05-05 20:16:04,215,39,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kfip1o/how_climate_change_threatens_retirement_for/,/r/climatechange/comments/1kfip1o/how_climate_change_threatens_retirement_for/,False,True,False,submission,NoOutlandishness1848,,False,1746533791.873145,2025-05-05 20:16:04

1kazp39,ClimateActionPlan,Building a Toronto Climate Week for 2026,"Hi everyone,

I’m posting again to share an exciting opportunity and gather support for something I believe could have a big impact in our city. Now that the election results are in, I think the timing is perfect to bring this idea to life.

For the past few years, I’ve been living in San Francisco while working on my Master's in Energy Systems Management. During this time, I had the privilege of helping organize SF Climate Week 2024 and saw firsthand how powerful an event like this can be in driving real change.

As I prepare to return to Toronto, I’d love to gauge interest in launching Toronto Climate Week starting in 2026. After seeing how events like this work in cities such as San Francisco and New York, I’m confident that Toronto is in an excellent position to host its own week of climate-focused activities.

Why Toronto Needs Its Own Climate Week

- Global Networking: A chance to connect local innovators with global experts, fostering collaborations that transcend borders.
- Economic Impact: Large-scale events like Climate Week NYC and London Climate Action Week attract thousands, benefiting local businesses and boosting the city's international profile.
- Accelerating Local Solutions: SF Climate Week uses a decentralized model where community-driven events thrive. This format could work wonders in Toronto too.
- Showcasing Local Innovation: Toronto has outstanding sustainability projects, cleantech startups, and research efforts that deserve greater visibility.
- Community Building: A platform for people from various sectors to come together and tackle climate challenges specific to our region.

What This Could Look Like

Inspired by successful models in other cities, Toronto Climate Week could feature:

- Panel discussions and workshops
- Networking events for professionals
- Community engagement activities
- Showcases of local climate solutions
- Partnerships with businesses, universities, and government

Looking for Collaborators

I’m looking to build a core group of passionate individuals who want to help bring this event to life. If you have experience in event planning, sustainability, communications, community organizing, or simply care about climate action, I’d love to connect.

If you’re interested in being part of this initiative or have any suggestions, feel free to comment below or DM me. I’ll also post a link to a Luma page for an initial meeting in May for anyone interested in getting involved.",2025-04-29 23:36:04,4,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/1kazp39/building_a_toronto_climate_week_for_2026/,/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/1kazp39/building_a_toronto_climate_week_for_2026/,False,True,False,submission,thundergod2802,,False,1746533869.579269,2025-04-29 23:36:04

That’s 122F and 104F. In April.

What happens to agriculture in those temperatures? What happens to farmers? There are already school closures in India did to heat.

From the article:

“Temperatures south Asians dread each year arrive early as experts talk of ever shorter transition to summer-like heat”

And:

“Delhi authorities urged schools to cancel afternoon assemblies on Tuesday and issued emergency guidelines to ensure water breaks and stocks of oral rehydration salts in first aid kits, and to treat any signs of heat stress immediately.”

The sea temperature around Denmark has risen by about one degree Celsius over the past year — a significant increase, according to Danish meteorologists.

**Unusually Warm April** April 2024 has brought record-high temperatures, not only on land but also at sea. The surface temperature in Danish waters is now about **1°C higher** than at the same time last year. This is based on data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).

**Climate Expert: A Warning Sign** According to climate researcher **Martin Olesen** from DMI, such a sharp rise in sea temperatures is concerning. While fluctuations occur naturally, this trend aligns with the broader effects of global warming. ""It's a warning sign that the sea is reacting strongly to climate change,"" he says.

**Consequences for Marine Life** Rising sea temperatures can affect marine ecosystems — fish stocks may shift, and the risk of **algae blooms** increases. Warmer waters also reduce the ocean's ability to absorb **CO₂**, which further accelerates global warming.

**Global Pattern** The temperature spike is not unique to Denmark. The World Meteorological Organization has reported **record-high ocean temperatures globally** in the past year.

1kcqpa5,collapse,New study finds over $1 trillion in corporate assets at risk from global warming by 2050.,"A new, wide-angle take on corporate climate risk.

**Companies listed on the world's** biggest stock exchanges have over $1 trillion at risk ahead in countries facing high climate vulnerabilities, a new analysis finds. [Verisk Maplecroft's study](https://link.axios.com/click/39669693.51557/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFwbGVjcm9mdC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMtYW5kLXNvbHV0aW9ucy9jbGltYXRlLWFuZC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pbnNpZ2h0cy8lMjQxLjE0LXRyaWxsaW9uLWluLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS12YWx1ZS1sb2NhdGVkLWluLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3N0LWF0LXJpc2stZnJvbS1jbGltYXRlLXVwaGVhdmFsLz91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2dlbmVyYXRlJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/64494ca7ef011b681d0e12c4B8472f4a9) takes a newly expansive view of corporate climate jeopardy.

* The risk consultancy explores exposure to forces like political instability, declining workforce productivity, migration and much more.

They state:

""Data from our Climate Hazard and Vulnerability Index (CHVI) reveals that second-order climate risks, such as economic and political instability, poverty, migration and food insecurity could become highly impactful in 48 countries by 2050.""

""In an intermediate emissions scenario, where average global temperatures are likely to rise by up to +2.7°C, the number of countries that are most vulnerable to climate change doubles by mid-century, up from 24 in the current climate.""

\_\_\_\_\_

That +2.7°C of warming is by 2100. The reality is that we have been at +1.6°C for over 12 months now and 2025 has the potential to average out at +1.7°C over baseline. The Rate of Warming is currently unknown, but over the last 10 years it averages out to +0.36°C per decade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Based on the current locations of assets and market capitalisation valuations, the data shows a dramatic increase in the financial exposure of companies and investors in the S&P 500, DAX, CAC 40, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 from the current level of just USD $34.8 billion.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Got that? The amount of assets ""at risk"" just increased from $34 billion to $1.14 trillion. That's a X30 fold increase in corporate exposure to losses from climate change.

**How it works:** The analysis graphs each country's exposure to three major buckets of risk.

* Hazards like extreme weather events and long-term, chronic changes in temperature and precipitation levels.
* The sensitivity of their populations based on health, poverty levels, farming reliance and more.
* Adaptation capacity based on factors like institutions' strength and political stability.

* There are threats to corporate assets in big emerging markets, especially India, but also Nigeria, Pakistan and others.

**Threat level:** While the report focuses on valuations and assets, it's a reflection of global warming hitting people hard.

* It notes that fast-growing, lower-income nations ""will bear the brunt of the climate crisis despite their low overall contribution to global emissions.""
* Western companies headquartered in richer, more resilient countries are not insulated, given risks to their operations abroad.

**The bottom line:** ""Markets tend to price risk at the corporate level, yet climate vulnerabilities manifest where assets are located, not just where companies are domiciled,"" said Franca Wolf, the firm's principal markets analyst.",2025-05-02 04:48:14,366,44,0.98,https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/climate-and-environment/insights/%241.14-trillion-in-corporate-value-located-in-countries-most-at-risk-from-climate-upheaval/?stream=top,/r/collapse/comments/1kcqpa5/new_study_finds_over_1_trillion_in_corporate/,False,False,False,submission,TuneGlum7903,,False,1746533921.022435,2025-05-02 04:48:14

I know he doesn't use the class analysis that Marxists use but I see this as a weakness on his part because he doesn't offer a path to achieve the necessary change other than advocating for greater individual awareness of the capitalist system (which he doesn't identify so this seems to just confuse people further) or reformism, which we know is a dead end.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

The sounds of battle—**shelling, gunfire, explosions**—were heard around Damascus (metro pop: 2.8M), Syria on Tuesday & Wednesday. At least [16 were slain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/deadly-syria-clashes-continue-for-second-day-outside-damascus) in attacks against the Druze minority, though some sources [say 40+ dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kjn0jkjo). The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack.

A 54-page, U.S.-aligned think tank [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025) on **threats in space**—by countries—was published two weeks ago. Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened. The report does not mention the possibility of [Kessler Syndrome](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/). Although funding for the Pentagon is set to decrease, President Trump’s [overall **defense budget hit new highs**](https://archive.ph/ZjRyI), breaching $1T for the first time ever. And that doesn’t even include [increases to Homeland Security](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/trump-budget-proposal-defense-spending)’s budget—or mention the wide-ranging cuts to science, welfare, health, and environmental programs.

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate. 

-Tokyo is having train delays, says [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpmlwap/) from the world’s largest megacity (metro pop: 38M, *shiiiiit*). **Food shortages**, including for rice, are also being recorded. Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse.

1kdp0tf,collapse,Collapse Freewrite Q2 2025,"Finished this a bit after casual Friday ended. Sorry mods. Just tired to write out 10k characters with minor breaks and minimal editing.

---

Ya know, the fascinating thing is it does just continue to get worse. Go to work, eat, look at the ol' black mirror, shit, shower and do it again.

The rot continues, if only we'd spent more on building aesthetic spires to crumble and rust as monuments to our hubris. The freeway system will have to do. In a way it reflects the native mound builders far more closely than our forefathers would have liked us to remember their victims. 

The younger generation cannot conceptualize of the world before computers; they cannot see the bounty of nature which was once the basis of human life. I am not old enough to have seen the salmon runs of the un-dammed West Coast, or the cod fishery of the East Coast. The stands of old growth timber. Massive flocks of birds and herds of deer. Mythic herds of bison, stretching horizon to horizon. But I am old enough to have known people who were there. People who were not particularly old when I was young.

Silent spring was indeed prophetic of the changes in our ecosystem. Reading the scientific literature confirms my own brief and anecdotal years of being pretty interested in looking at bugs. 

The most fascinating is the decline (locally) of big orb weavers, they just don't get enough random flying bugs to grow to impressive size. As a child we'd let one big orb weaver each year live next to our porch light. Perhaps it is just a local population anomaly, or overzealous pesticide application, but my parents still live in that house and I don't see the orb weavers there anymore. 

You'd think that anyone with eyes could see it, but we live in a post-scientific hellscape. They're all too busy, distracted, stressed, and scared. Truth is not some abstract, philosophical concept. There is one Truth, and it exists omnipresent. Truth is a hammer.

You cannot lie to basic science. Counting things. Measuring temperatures. Asking doctors to fill out a form. Probably more than half of healthcare is filling out a form correctly, they're good at it. Diligent even. 

To say nothing of climatologists. It isn't like they're going to stop taking the temperature in places and writing it down. Foundational to the discipline. Simple like a lever, climatologists want to take the temperature of everywhere obviously plotted by time. They'd prefer even more measurements of temperature at various heights, humidity, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and satellite imagery; but the temperature each hour is very fascinating on its own. 

This isn't some post-graduate set theory garbage either, we're talking sums and averages. A diligent person of about my age could probably plot the average temperature increase by recording their digital weather station. My 5th grade teacher, Mr. Austin, put a digital weather station on the roof of the elementary school. If someone had been good enough to save the daily high and low temperature in an excel file, we could probably track the trend line of daily average temperature going up.  

The thing is, they must feel it. Spiritually. Everything is too complex. The character creation screen has become too cluttered. The options for specialization are both too broad in possibilities and to narrow in the viable metagame of late capitalism. 

We cannot abide a limit, private equity will need to continue to pillage the country. Burn the economic furnace of a dying consumer economy to hot. Rivulets of slag hold but tiny grains of gold, mirroring the toxic fires of a 3rd-world electronics recycling operation. Of course where the raw, visceral life is killed by heavy metals and PCBs; the soul is killed by the slow dismantling of social order for increased profit. Every edge we clip on the gold coin nets a tiny flake of raw profit. Neverminded the edge they're pinching is actually a human being, one which could be construed to have the same rights as the idiot doing the cutting. 

Socially attuned [Shipwreck Kellys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_%22Shipwreck%22_Kelly) sitting atop the pole. They see themselves not as nobility but as superior. Nobility claimed descendance from God's own rule, at least they didn't claim the accident of their birth at a specific temporal nexus of unfathomable wealth and power from the computer revolution made them fit to reimagine society. 

It is clear one cannot talk of them, obliquely moving through the algo. Their names are sigils, beacons. The centers of power cannot cast their gaze everywhere. Even the most persistent bot farm cannot stomach the run cost of an LLM for every post. They cannot scrutinize imperfectness in the human variables of written communication. The informal yet highly professional style of an unbroken line of forums, BBS, and social media microcosms. Like a Morse code enthusiasts being able to hear the 'hand' of a familiar operator, there is something about just stream of consciousness smashing out words. As a lifelong hater, I begin to see the appeal of James Joyce, no LLM could produce such deep nonsense which somehow resolves into the intentional parody of narrative structure... 

I'm really trying not to edit this, like this is literally an author's note to not spell check the previous sentence. Keep writing. 

The whole thing about it, gestures broadly at the complex memetic webs which have been used to construct society. Debt, serfdom, the company town. The zero-sum game players have gotten enough of the pie, despite the current system producing untold wealth. Instead of using the last 4 decades of human progress on computer technology to benefit the masses. They need to use the most complex assemblage of systems ever to manipulate and inform on the individual back to the digital surveillance state. 

We're so close to true sapience. But two or three generations of cosmonauts from permanent habitation on another world. The clutching, evil hands of a million, million hungry ghosts prioritized everything from the Vietnam War, to the Iraq War, and the multiple economic bailouts, really could have been spent on space research. The senators of the 1960s and 1970s understood this. Any piece of technology which went to the moon would cost them just a little bit from the war and economic stimulus bucket. Not even 1% of the nation's GDP. And now because we need to launch the shittiest satellites into the worst orbits, we're in some kind of really boring cold war 2.0 with polluting even the near vacuum in Earth's valuable equatorial orbits. 

We didn't even have to do that, we could have sat down and made plans about all this. Jimmy Carter and Al Gore both knew about the pretty basic projections of unlimited fossil fuel usage. Of course, could the post-Clinton neolibs really understand the implications of the Brooks Brother's Riot? The thing about current fringe theories about the events around November 5th, they might just be repeats of the hanging chads. With a solid understanding of electoral minutia, just basic data science and some source code, you could probably drastically swing a narrow election. Be it FL in 2000 or PA in 2024, the minor discrepancies will be slowly chewed on and gently forgotten. 

One can pretty easily fathom the required systems needed to count several hundred thousand pieces of paper. Like maybe 200 people and some special clipboards. But can you fathom exactly what needs to be done to audit an electronic voting system? You gotta burn paper ballots, bub. Sparking, burning, and fading out is exactly what all electrons want to do, elementally. There is nothing but harddrives, DBAN'd and smashed. Still perfectly arrayed miracles of mining and industry. 

See, that's the thing that gets me. I feel with a second roll of the dice, perhaps industrial society would have gone down a different path. But no, we rolled war, war, cold war, very brief period of massive technological growth and prosperity, and now we see the decline. We see it like the cresting of a great wave. A boot stomping on a human face forever.

The whole thing is these people are losers. Unlimited sex, travel, drugs and these guys are just out there fucking it up. I'd wrestle the Rät for the wad of $100 bills he keeps stuffed up his floppy asshole. How did this guy fail his way into global power, and not just that one, like every techno-feudal warlord? Seriously when did these creep-ass children of privilege think they needed cosmetic face injections. Walking around like a parody of a human being, a worm in a very expensive meat suit. You have to put another very expensive fabric suit on over the meat suit and wear the right kinda tie... Makes the game a bit unfair to normal butt worms, not like those brain worms at all. 

Not to sound like a pinko, but what happens when our managers agree to expand the starving underclass? Homelessness is probably going to skyrocket, while overpriced luxury apartment condos sit even more empty. Pervasive surveillance is manned by an army of contracted security increasingly tied to the militarized police force. Wally World is already a fortress of cameras, built for automated tracking of every human in the store for market research and loss prevention. 

The witch-kings of capital increasingly see us as cattle, to be owned algorithmically by their post-scarcity idiot society. The torment nexus might have just been Zuck's inner monolog the whole time. Carved up into some NFT with the apparent ability to kill you for any reason. The hyper advanced techo-utopia will in fact be directly ruled by the whims of a babyman. The great botfarms will mostly be posting in random internet wastelands. One must wonder if the scaling issues in LLM performance are they just don't have better sources of data to train the systems upon. 

There was one specific point in the internet where you needed to download the whole thing, and as many copyrighted books as possible, every digitally available scientific journal article, and maybe a dozen colleges worth of undergraduate science papers. And people who made that data horde just set the mental course of our vibe coding development cycle of global power systems. 

The environment just gets more hostile, as the climate gets worse, and we see private equity take over the whole country. They bought the whole thing. As long as any one entity keeps only a sixth part of the whole capitalist system. It would be sacrilegious if AB-inbev owned all of the US domestic beer brands? Bud, Miller and Coors, you've gone too far. But you can have two of them and 58% of the domestic beer brands. 

We can have 5 movie studios who make all the news. We can have a whole layer of the internet be replaced by a few huge companies. Two major companies serve ads to every eyeball on the internet. Election coverage is shaped by pleasing headlines for the various social media landscapes. Algospeak is the language of those willfully oppressed by systems which have no more control over them than a really persuasive black rock about the size of a fist. 

The jailer hasn't put us in irons, it is entirely a question of our brains individual willpower over endless mental self-stimulation. We've built these towing pillars of informational complexity. Any assemblage is too much for a single human mind, so someone starts looking at something in all that data. Prognosticating, pondering, perceiving on the global demand for short form video. Blasted straight into the brains of idiots, no condom, no ethics board. Twitter gives you fucking mental illness, they did a big study to make it worse. 

We sit on a beach, watching the tide come in. You can se the sickly bright lights of the power plant across the bay. The sand doesn't feel right and the rushing of water is much too close. One cannot hide the Truth, only deny it in one's mind. The ocean will claim its due.",2025-05-03 11:30:24,8,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,/r/collapse/comments/1kdp0tf/collapse_freewrite_q2_2025/,False,True,False,submission,freedcreativity,,False,1746533926.167368,2025-05-03 11:30:24

1kfijtv,sustainability,I'm a complete ignoramus about this topic: Please educate me and give me some pointers,"Hello wonderful folks: I'm coming down to earth after years of denial in a radical section of the Church, that is intent upon looking away from climate change and the catastrophic effects of human choices upon plant and animal life. Climate change, they say, is a left wing hoax. I used to believe it for a long time and scoff at people who suggested something was seriously off with the planet.

They say the first step towards change is admitting there is a problem. While I understand that our current use of natural resources is unsustainable in the long run, and accept that climate change is real, I hardly know what I can do to make a change.

I hardly buy clothes, and when I do, I keep them for life. I buy them from military hardware store (Silvermans) so as to have extreme durability and lifespan. I have started to recycle. As you can see from my user name, I am a incense enthusiast. I've learnt a lot about the exploitation of trees for incense and only buy sustainable resins and from sources that ethically source plant resins. But what else can I do? The amount of information online is overwhelming.

Could you please give me a good starting point about learning about sustainability. I'm an intensely pragmatic person who believes in *doing* rather than *talking.* I live modestly, and I say this not as a matter of virtue signalling; just as a matter of fact. I don't drive. I eat vegetarian food. Milk is still hard to quit. Use public transport exclusively. But that's about it.

But I'd love to *do* more. If you know resources that I can use to convince some of my other friends, please point these out to. There is deep denial in some quarters. And I believe the answer is in providing so much information that denial becomes impossible. This is how I began to see the problem.

It's been a humbling and somewhat terrifying journey as I am starting to reckon the impact of my choices. I still don't want it to be true. It causes me serious anxiety as I deeply love the natural world and the thought of it all fading away is giving me sleepless nights. Is it really as bad as I think it is, and is the situation beyond hope? Please provide scientific, meaningful, practical responses. I'd rather hear the bad news than live in the land of lotus eaters.",2025-05-05 20:10:30,8,15,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/1kfijtv/im_a_complete_ignoramus_about_this_topic_please/,/r/sustainability/comments/1kfijtv/im_a_complete_ignoramus_about_this_topic_please/,False,True,False,submission,IncenseHound,,False,1746533934.402607,2025-05-05 20:10:30
