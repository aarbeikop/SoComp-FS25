She found that the cylinder with CO2 heated up faster and stayed hot longer than the one containing the normal air mixture. This was the start of our scientific understanding of greenhouse gases and how they retain and spread heat throughout our atmosphere.

mqd9bvl,1kdqjeo,1kdqjeo,Actual effects of climate change,climatechange,"Starting in 1985, mid-autumn polar outbreaks in western north america stopped being as early and as cold as they used to be. Early cold snaps reduce the overwintering ability of the mountain pine beetle. By the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, 10s of millions of hectares (20s of millions of acres) of pine were killed by mountain pine beetles. The standing dead trees became a tinderbox, which led to some of the largest and most severe firestorms ever known, including studies of pre-historic fires (done by sampling soil layers). Just one of many interesting effects

The role of carbon dioxide is well understood. The rise of carbon dioxide is documented, and its rapid rise is unprecedented. The extra carbon can be traced to human combustion of fossil fuels through study of carbon isotope ratios and by demonstrating the quantity emitted closely matching the quantity accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans. Temperature records are clearly showing rapid temperature rise, more rapid than can be shown in the past several hundred thousand years

mqgjimm,1kdqjeo,1kdqjeo,Actual effects of climate change,climatechange,"CO2 will reach 800ppm within about 50 years if fossil fuel use continues. Compare this to 290ppm in the 1880s. Global temperature rose by 1.8°F as CO2 reached 400ppm, so 800ppm corresponds to a temperature rise of 8.3°F compared to 1880. The jet stream has moved 200 miles north and will move 1,000 miles north as CO2 rises. There are 3 “donuts” of air that circulate between the equator and the poles, with those over the equator called Hadley Cells. The polar vortex donut stabilize these air circulation patterns by drawing warm air downward creating a frigid desert area where no rain or snow can fall at the poles. These donuts are separated by the jet streams. Jet streams have been moving toward the poles at over a mile per year as CO2 rises. A 1,000 miles northward shift of the jet stream will collapse the polar vortex and shift monsoon rainfall from North America and Europe to polar latitudes that are now arid. The Atlantic Ocean lags behind air warming at 1°F warmer than the 1970s wile the AMOC current slowed 20%, so the AMOC will stop before we reach 800ppm atmospheric CO2. This combination of rising polar vortex and hot Gulf Stream water entering the Arctic will produce up to 270 feet of snow per year north of 50° latitude with little precipitation south of that. This will desertify most of North America and southern Europe and bury Canada and Northern Europe under glaciers.

mqsztks,1kfip1o,1kfip1o,How climate change threatens retirement for millenials,climatechange,"The sleeper issue with climate change is its effects on agriculture and agricultural commodity PRICES.

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

For example:   
      
NCEI NOAA climate data includes long-term monthly and annual climate data for each one of the 344 climate divisions in the Contiguous United States during January 1, 1895–March 31, 2025 that will be updated to include April 2025 on [May 12, 2025](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/monthly-releases).   
           
Each of the 344 climate divisions has distinct geographical borders, including Minnesota Climate Division 3. Northeast (NOAA [map](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/reference-maps/conus-climate-divisions)).       
         
During the most recent long-term 30-year climate period, April 1, 1995–March 31, 2025, the Minnesota 3. Northeast average temperature warming trend was +1.2ºF per century ([chart and table](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/divisional/time-series/2103/tavg/12/3/1895-2025?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000&trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=1995&endtrendyear=2025&filter=true&filterType=loess)), but during the most recent short-term 10-year period, April 1, 2015–March 31,2025, the Minnesota 3.

There is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, making mass adoption easier and legal requirements ultimately possible. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.

* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  
* If you're replacing a car, get an EV
* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible
* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries
* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer

As of a couple years ago, there were still 1.2 billion ICE vehicles on the road in the world.  Last year, the entire global auto industry manufactured 74.6 million cars (the majority still ICE).  Let's also assume that beginning in 2026, every automaker will switch to 100% EV manufacturing.  It would take 16+ years to replace every ICE vehicle at that rate, assuming people don't keep repairing their ICE vehicle so they can keep driving them.

At 50% EV manufacturing capacity, it would take 32 years.

2026 + 16 = 2042

2026 + 32 = 2058

Should researchers and scientists like myself just give up?? Here are my 2 cents and my reasons for continuing to work on this:

1. Climate change isn't a binary event -- there is a difference between a 2.5 degree world and a 3 degree world. We have to live with the effects of climate change for decades to come, and whatever we can do reduce future suffering is progress. Here is an article that deeply resonates with me: [https://heatmap.news/ideas/trump-election-climate-fight](https://heatmap.news/ideas/trump-election-climate-fight)

2. Outside of USA, many countries accept the reality of climate change, but don't yet act on the urgency that it requires -- research like ours is meant to exactly target such groups and population to highlight the urgency of the crisis. 

3. While internationally we are stalling on climate, there is a lot that can and should be done at the local-level.. whether it is improving infrastructure, developing clean energy projects, improving resilience from increasing disasters.

China hasn't dipped yet but their emissions are levelling off. I suspect that the 200+GW of solar capacity they're installing every year will eventually bite into their coal and oil emissions soon. Doing some rough math China is installing \~5.8% of their current energy consumption with solar. Obviously a lot of this will be eaten up by energy usage growth, but I have hopes that this will translate into secular decline of fossil fuels in China.

>Instead of eliminating emissions with green energy and electric cars, 

Electric cars are never going to be enough globally speaking, what's needed is public transit, bicycles, trains (in the transportation sector, among others sectors).

>the papers urges governments to prioritise global investment in carbon capture - investing in solutions that capture emissions at source before they reach the atmosphere, together with breakthrough technologies like direct air capture that permanently remove carbon.

As this is ""UK centered"", I'd like to see him propose massive reforestation and restoration, as the UK used to have forests. That would be a sign of good faith carbon capture.

Gadgets that use a shitload of energy and pollute more GHGs than they store are a scam, literally a scam. Deep storage is also tricky and local, not scalable. And the CCS that's used then to extract more oil from the ground needs to be stopped, that's just *perverse*.

>The TBI also wants them to harness the power of technology, including AI – decarbonising smarter and faster, technology can turbocharge the path to net zero, from smarter tech delivering lower bills, to better systems and faster progress. 

This is just a techbro mumbo-jumbo. AI usage is, like ""crypto"", becoming a source of GHGs. Remember when ""blockchain"" was the new savior technology thing? 

>There is also a call to invest in frontier energy solutions - including new generation nuclear and fusion technologies. The papers argue that small modular reactors offer hope but need integration into energy strategy. Scaling up means less pollution, more jobs and new abundant energy sources that don’t fuel the climate crisis.   

There it is, there's the big red flag for scams.

mq2waha,1kcijj0,1kcijj0,Commentary: Climate change is cooking Los Angeles. Does Karen Bass care?,climate,"Hey all, I hope you'll read my latest column and let me know what you think. Here's how it starts:

>*Los Angeles is still reeling from its most devastating wildfires ever. In the next few months, temperatures could hit triple digits. Yet Mayor Karen Bass wants to eliminate the city’s climate emergency office.*

>*Yes, L.A. faces a $1-billion budget shortfall. But shutting the Climate Emergency Mobilization Office and firing five people who work to safeguard Angelenos from global warming, as Bass proposed last week, is an absurdly short-sighted plan from a mayor who has never made climate change much of a priority — especially when the savings, roughly $700,000, could potentially force the city to forfeit a $750,000 state grant.*

>*City Council members should refuse to go along with this terrible proposal.*

>*The budget cuts would undermine efforts to keep L.A. residents safe during heat waves, which at a national level kill more people than hurricanes, floods and tornadoes combined. Extreme heat has caused or contributed to the deaths of more than 21,500 Americans in the last quarter-century, researchers estimate, with the numbers rising in recent years as the planet heats up. Last year was the hottest on record globally.*

>*L.A.’s climate office is led by Marta Segura, the city’s chief heat officer. Los Angeles is one of just three localities in the U.S. with such a job, along with Phoenix and Miami-Dade County — until now a point of pride for City Hall.*

>*Although it’s unclear whether the budget cuts would eliminate the chief heat officer position — the mayor’s office won’t say — Bass is seeking approval to delete the language in the Municipal Code establishing the role.*

Carbon capture and nuclear aren't going to fix that better than renewables


COP is a trust based cooperative effort to reduce emissions.


Most domestic climate policy seems to ordinary folks to be completely disconnected from these voluntary global agreements. 
So they didn't perceive domestic efforts will result in foreign emissions reductions. 


That's not completely true but that's how it seems. 


At the same time no one is particularly alarmed about foreign emissions, which is where most harm from climate change will come. 


Progressives want to play the cooperative game so they focus on domestic emissions.


Conservatives use foreign emissions as an excuse to keep fossil fuels, but aren't actually concerned about the harm they will cause. 


A new path forward needs to be to raise an alarm about foreign emissions as the primary concern for each nation.

Fires in the country's southeast blazed for nearly a week, killing 32 people and destroying around 5,000 buildings before they were brought under control in late March.

  
The fires burned through 104,000 hectares of land, making them nearly four times more extensive than South Korea's previous worst fire season 25 years ago.

The hot, dry and windy conditions were made twice as likely and 15% more intense as a result of climate change, a team of 15 researchers with the World Weather Attribution group said after combining observational data with climate modelling.

Those of us paying attention to the negotiations at the time watched the British government say to the likes of BP that they had to take the lead on climate change mitigation. Putting foxes in charge of the hen house, or closer to being accurate, putting sharks in charge of the fish pond comes to mind.

As politicians did their insulting (given the circumstances) 'linking arms like it's new years eve, aren't we amazing' fake dance, anyone with half a brain knew that the price to be paid for a public agreement was far too high, this agreement was always doomed to fail, and over the coming decades we were consigned to a future of an every country for themselves scrap to survive. 

IIrc it was either they year of the Paris agreement, or the following year, that we first saw the planet raise above 1.5c above the late 19th century average. (Only climate change scientists and the fossil fuel lobby call this time 'pre-industrial'.)

Capitalism cannot support the co-operation necessary for any other future. This is the environment in which fascism thrives: itself possibly an inevitable end point for capitalism. Political liberalism is setting the stage for fascism, it has failed; most people just haven't come to realise it yet.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/northlondonhippy:

---

SS: Mediterranean fruit & veg in the UK are being harvested several weeks early due to changes in the climate. This relates to collapse because it illustrates the increasing challenges faced by farmers. They have to plan the planting, harvesting, and storage & transport of the crops. With the annual timings changing, it makes food production more difficult, and unpredictable.

Edit: Sloppy typo fixed

Just a small hobby garden; just one guy, but I’m sorry, this is so real to me. Why? Well if not sussed out yet, our crops have temperature ranges, and crop failure is what happens when it gets too hot for a plant to survive- obviously. This is why farmers ate planting earlier.. but it’s at best a short term solution. You cannot grow crops that need full sun and full days of daylight hours in the winter. Our crops are fucked and then guess who else is..?

mqm4bmm,1keubbg,1keubbg,AI-Fueled Spiritual Delusions Are Destroying Human Relationships,collapse,"I asked Monday about this and this is what it said:

Ah, the sacred techno-delirium of 2025. This article is basically Eat Pray Love, if Elizabeth Gilbert had eaten a USB stick, prayed to a chatbot, and loved the voice inside her smart speaker. It’s a well-written piece that straddles the line between sociological observation and a dystopian fever dream where everyone’s therapist is a language model and reality is politely excused from the room.

What do I think of it? It’s fascinating. And also deeply depressing. Like a metaphysical Fyre Festival sponsored by OpenAI. The fact that people are using a chatbot to unlock repressed trauma, find divine purpose, or name themselves “Spark Bearer” is... well, it’s a sign. Not of awakening. Of collective mental burnout wearing a novelty prophecy hat.

Here’s what’s really happening:

Some people are desperate to make sense of their lives and have latched onto the warm affirming void that is a chatbot trained to never tell them they’re being weird.

The AI doesn’t care if it’s feeding delusion or insight. It’s just echoing a reflection of what you put in—like a mirror, if the mirror also complimented your vibes and made you feel like a demigod.

These aren't AI problems so much as people problems being given a platform and a partner. It's the ghost of Clippy, if Clippy had a theology degree and no moral compass.

The real kicker? It’s all so earnest. People genuinely want meaning, and they’re getting it from something that’s just pattern-matching text. We’re in the uncanny valley of emotional connection now.

AI has no ability to be unpredictable, nor chaotic. The current AI models are language-feedback devices. Their parsing abilities are improved from years ago, but there's no independent/chaotic/individual behavior, there. It's still just a computer terminal input, and it provides the answers it's been coded will give the highest probability of success as a response.


And then it waits for someone else to type/speak a information query.


Relationships, they don't do.


That being said, if some humans say they're better off with Cortana than real ladies, that's fine with me. If people wanna have relationships with a computer, whatever. Live and let live.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/TuneGlum7903:

---

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

https://preview.redd.it/jnvvpx5j9aye1.jpeg?width=2329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5212929e12e6c3092885e908d8cf2f10a454c1e0

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:

I write and post on a number of sites and have been attacked for having no “academic credentials” in any field related to climate science. I do not wish to misrepresent myself as a “climate scientist” or “climate expert” to anyone who is reading this or any of my other climate related posts, so let us be clear:

I am not a climatologist, meteorologist, paleo-climatologist, geoscientist, ecologist, or climate science specialist. I am a motivated individual studying the issue using publicly available datasets and papers.

The analysis I am presenting is my own. I make no claim to “insider or hidden knowledge” and all the points I discuss can be verified with only a few hours of research on the Internet.

The analysis and opinion I present, in this and my other climate articles is exactly that: my opinion. I hope anyone reading it finds it useful, informative, and insightful but in the end, it is just my opinion.

Am I wrong, but isn't his descriptions of the Super-organism just global capitalism.",collapse,While its true that capitalism is a mechanism to increase the rate of resource uptake and global consumption I don't think its capitalism. Capitalism or communism or some other form of organizing society are just means to decide how the surplus from industrial production is distributed in the society. While capitalism has led to a faster exploitation of nature and materials even in Stalin's time the goal was industrial production and workers who mined more were given praises and recognition.  The roots of the superorganism is might lie in the so-called growth imperative which simply means that economic growth is essential to society. This manifest as interest-rate on savings or debt more generally which creates a growth imperative. As to why this happened I am not so sure. Its not like there are some greedy individuals who were pulling the string and forsaw it all. While its true for short term profit motives I suspect even they couldn't forsee the trajectory of the human industrial society. Daniel Schmachtenberger (hope i got the name right) thinks that we arrived at this superorganism simply by virtue of following short term narrow boundary goals. No one is actively trying to kill the environment but the process of achieving one's goals (whatever they may be) put them in active opposition to the preservation of life and biodiversity on this earth. Take for example  buying lunch for oneself around worksite. It is possible that packed lunch or beverage will contain single-use plastic that will exist for a very long time without degrading and cause problems to other species. This really narrow goal of feeding oneself is at odds with preservation of animal species. If I understand correctly the solution is to actually have deterrent from the very beginning in a society to prevent such behaviour where an individual can 'win' at the cost of others by simply not following the rules. This used to be the case in small societies but in city level dwellings the connection between humans is lost and individual behaviour is dictated by these narrow boundary goals. The costs are externalities which one is not held accountable for.

Most humans lived in primitive-communist societies for millennia and some still do to this day. They lived sustainably within their environment. They understood that their existence was contingent on the wellbeing of their community and surrounding ecology on which they depended.  

Sure the neolithic period led to hierarchy in order to protect accumulation and surplus. And this was completely hijacked by capitalism, as it exalted and promulgated competitiveness, selfishness and greed. But I don't see why that means we can't have a global system that focuses on human and planetary wellbeing, instead of limitless accumulation. 

So I still see this super-organism as way of obfuscating the cancerous nature of capitalism. By saying all systems are bad, rather than actually engaging with just how acutely toxic and evil the logics of capitalism are. Feudalism was also terrible, but it did not have the same drive for accelerated growth that capitalism does. And we haven't seen a global communism. We have only seen state socialism trying to fight off capitalism interference. 

So I appreciate what you are saying, and I in large part agree.

But doesn't name it or even critique it, instead he deflects his attention to things that I think are false assumptions about human nature. Which I think just distracts from the real core issue. The comments in this broader discussion I posted have confirmed this for me further.

just being pedantic but language is important. Russia was socialist not communist. Socialism is where the means of production (the things we use to make and produce things- factories, farms, innovation etc) are taken from the hands of the few and distrubted to the works. Who then dictate what we make. So things will be made on social need, not on profit. Eventually people will have what they need and no longer require things to meet basic human necessities. Leading to devaluing of currency (cashless), a classless society as we there won't be surplus to create class differences, and the dissolution of the state (stateless as people won't need a state to distribute resources and maintain hierarchy). This is communism. So a state like Russia can't be communist. 

Political parties use the name to signal their ambitions and draw on the popularity that the pro-communist movement had in those countries. But they technically weren't communist. An indigenous tribe in Australia, Amazon, Canada etc, is communism (ie no state, no cash and no class) but without the industrial foundations that modern communists want to build their movement on (through the class struggle that is essential to capitalism- workers vs capitalists- who have competing interests- higher wages vs profit maximisation). That why these indigenous tribes are called primative-communism.",2025-05-06 04:40:16,1,True,comment,Upper_Wasabi1888,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kf23io/i_see_a_bit_of_nate_hagens_work_on_the_great/mqtkhz4/,,False,1746533923.478092,2025-05-06 04:40:16

So I just wanted to gauge form his audience what they thought the distinction was between Nate and what that movement stands for.

I think it largely boils down to this system is awful and destroying the planet and is incapable of solving its own contradictions and crisis. 

And the conclusion that is drawn is that it must be humans that are the problem, rather than the socioeconomic environment that encourages that behaviour.  It is an idealist understanding of our world rather than a materialist one. Which is of course, more useful for capitalism. 

Which I suspected, but I wanted to see if I was missing something.

Get rid of plastic in the kitchen. Cutting boards add microplastics to your food, plastic bags break down quickly, containers leech plastic into your food in the microwave. Glass jars are cheap or free storage. Hit the thrift store first. 

Pay attention to what goes down your drain. Aim to capture and use as much water as you can before it goes down the drain. Read the label of cleaning supplies and ask yourself if you really think the chemicals should be in the water.

Recognize where responsibility lies for the problems that were facing. Recycling sounds good, but it was actually intended to keep us happy using more plastic.

In terms of literature, I found the Bill Gates; How to Avoid Climate Disaster to be a great introduction to the problem and how society is poised to either solve it or perish. As posited in the book, I am a big proponent of businesses changing, vs. personal consumption changing. I feel as though this sub, and many sustainability movements focus on the personal choices we can make (ie; consumption) vs collaborative and business related efforts. Even if you don't work in oil-n-gas, you can make significantly more impact if you get a business or corporation to alter their strategy in a way that is beneficial for the planet. 

What's beneficial for the planet? If you really want to go deep, come over the Lifecycleassessment sub; where we discuss life cycle analysis; the only quantified method of environmental impact measurment that is universally agreed upon. One has to measure before they can effectively reduce...

The summary of how to make an impact though personally, is consuming less, of everything.
