Answer: you do it because it is how you create yourself. It is the same question we all face, and would be facing, even if climate catastrophe were not in prospect. It is the human condition and always has been.  We always and forever face futility  because we always and forever are mortal. Our being is defined by how we act in the face of that.

We create ourselves by our actions; if they are noble, we are noble, if they are cheap, we are cheap.

And in the words of a poet I once read: ""On the last day of the world, I will plant a tree.""

We may fail to make any difference but we will fail grandly, for something more important than ourselves.","2018-10-10 23:59:45","26","[deleted]","1747898030.386981","carbon footprint","manual"

* Limit food waste
* Low consumption lifestyle (from textiles to travel - it's all limited to what is necessary and far less than the average)
* Primary source of entertainment is digital, while it consumes electricity our total usage for a given month is under 300kWh (40% of the average for this area)

Human beings have faced catastrophe before. The ends of all the great empires of old felt that way to their citizens. Going from the Roman Empire to the Dark Ages felt like the end of the world. How about WW1, WW2 and cold war with nuclear annihilation possible at any moment?

We don't know what is going to happen. Most human predictions about the future are usually wildly off. There could be great technological breakthroughs. The human population could drastically drop by natural means. Whatever does happen will probably be something we weren't expecting.

Who thought the Soviet Union would suddenly collapse, ending the Cold War without a single nuke going off? Who predicted the internet? Who predicted any of the enormous scientific discoveries about the nature of the universe just in the last 20 years? (e.g. the rate at which it is expanding is increasing, not decreasing.)

The planet is much, much, much bigger than any decision you could possibly make. Regardless of what decisions you make in your own life, the planetary conditions that result will be substantially the same. The planetary climate is not responsive to you, and you aren't responsible for it.

So: Make decisions that are meaningful to you and the people around you. Spare a few thoughts for people you'll never meet, but could personally influence anyway. Consider yourself constrained by actual people, not by some giant abstraction like a planetary climate system.

"e7kkrwy","t3_9n4s5k","9n4s5k","climatechange","action-oriented","Don't leave your house in the suburbs my friend. Especially if it has some garden. If a catastrophe comes, it will hit those living in stuffed urban environments the most. 

If it becomes a survival struggle, being as independent as possible is important. Here are some things that will help you, so consider them:

* Stay in the house you have, and install solar panels. Make sure to also install batteries so energy doesn't go to waste. This way not only you will be sure that the power you're using is environment friendly, but also that in case power price rates go up because of the climate change, they won't affect you.

* If you have a garden, plant some trees and bushes that produce food, not flowers. Apple trees, olive trees, and such. Climate change might result in foot shortages, and this will result in chaos in urban environments. People will rush to buy and stock as much food as they can, and when you go to the super market or convenience store, you might find that there is nothing left. Perhaps the products of your garden might dwindle, or they might not be enough for a balanced diet, but hey, something is better than nothing. The less populated the area you're living is, the less are the chances one of your neighbors will flip and start using violence such as guns to get his food, at a situation where money can't buy you food.

* It would be better to live in a place where you are protected as much as possible from phenomena that can be related with extreme weather. For example living on a large plain is more dangerous than living on top of a cliff, when it comes to excessive rainfall, as the plains will flood, but the water will follow the hill downwards and won't accumulate on its top. Also it's good to make sure you are at least 30 meters away from forest trees. If the forest catches a wildfire, you want to be at a safe distance so that the flames won't reach your house. But it would be a good idea if a forest is in a convenient walking distance, especially if there are edible fruits, mushrooms, greenery, or even roots that can be find in it, so you can look out for food if the need arises. Also it will be good if you know of a nearby fresh water spring, so you can have drinkable water even if the water infrastructure of the state fails. But make sure to stay at a distance from rivers, especially if they are on higher ground. Because rivers might overflow, and flood your house. And of course it would be a good idea if your house is far from the ocean, because cyclones and such form on the ocean, and get weaker once they are over land. Also it would be a good idea to live at an altitude higher than sea level. At least 90 meters higher than sea level. Because if the ices of the poles melt, sea level will rise. Finally, if sea level rises, be prepared for the mass migration waves of people that will be leaving cities that are at low altitudes. Hundreds of millions of people around the world live in cities that would sink under water if pole ices melted, like Atlantis.

One way of accomplishing this is voting.  (But I don't even see politicians that are actively pursuing a path that is deemed necessary by the IPCC now.)

Getting enough voters to agree to radical lifestyle changes may be the hard part of it. Our economy, and much we take for granted, is based on carbon.  So much that despite Paris, we are reaching new record levels by the year.  Like a drug that we know to be harmful, and continue to use it anyway.  We experience pain (like the people affected by hurricanes, flash flooding, and droughts). But for others, it is just news and easily forgotten. 

I'm pessimistic that we will all get on the same page in time.  Trumps America of course being the elephant in the room here, but also emerging countries that may not be ready to replace coal in just a decade or two. By what?
