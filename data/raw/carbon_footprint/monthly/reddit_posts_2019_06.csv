"bwdd7p","climate","scientific","I'm trying to make our CO2 impact more tangible, and this carbon footprint calculator is the result!","www.move.kiwi

Hi! I built this site to try and nudge people towards less impactful forms of transport, but also to see if there are more relatable, engaging ways of expressing our CO2 impact.

If you've got time I'd really appreciate your help - which of the examples on the site are most effective for you? And which aren't that useful?

Any ideas to improve the effectiveness of the site would be greatly appreciated! :)","2019-06-03 17:28:18","1","1","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bwdd7p/im_trying_to_make_our_co2_impact_more_tangible/","True","soft_ware","1747919638.483758","carbon footprint","manual"

"bwewbi","environment","emotional","I calculated the carbon footprint of a ski holiday","I've built a website where I provide info around ways to effectively reduce your carbon footprint. Last week, I asked my subscribers to vote on what type of holiday they'd like me to calculate the carbon footprint for and a skiing one won.

Thought this community might be interested, so [here it is](https://www.mustard.cc/words/is-skiing-bad-for-the-environment/)!

I looked into a high carbon option (i.e. a normal ski holiday for most) and suggested ways that you can reduce your carbon footprint to make it significantly less bad for the environment. As an avid skier myself, the results were surprisingly positive!

Let me know what you think.","2019-06-03 19:34:33","5","1","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bwewbi/i_calculated_the_carbon_footprint_of_a_ski_holiday/","True","alexmustard","1747919727.3414779","carbon footprint","manual"
"bzhw3n","sustainability","action-oriented","Question about Carbon Footprint and Powdered Drinks","Hi All,

I'm new to this subreddit, sorry in advance for my question. I'm wondering about the carbon footprint and other ecological implications of purchasing powdered beverages (""Tang,"" ""Kool-Aid,"" etc.) as opposed to juices that are stored and transported as liquids. It seemed like the energy costs of transporting and refrigerating/freezing liquid drinks would give them a higher impact/footprint, and that switching to powdered juice might be a good (and relatively easy) way for me to reduce my carbon footprint. That said, I know nothing about how this stuff is produced, and for all I know the process of creating powdered drink mixes is very destructive! I'm wondering if anyone has insights they can share, or if there are other factors I should consider in making this decision about my future grocery shopping. Thanks!","2019-06-11 20:42:11","3","5","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bzhw3n/question_about_carbon_footprint_and_powdered/","True","RealSnarlak","1747920237.48832","carbon footprint","manual"
"c3as38","sustainability","action-oriented","Can you be an environmentalist and not a vegan?","I'm just wondering because I always assumed I was an environmentalist. But looking into it and how much the animal agriculture industry pollutes is crazy it's bigger than the fossil fuel industry... Which is absurd. I don't drive thankfully but I would have meat and dairy products sometimes 3 times a day! Now this is just a cultural norm in most ""1st world"" countries as we eat the majority of meat worldwide. So essentially the most effective way to reduce Ur carbon footprint is just not eating meat or dairy 3 times a day. It's the smallest thing you can do to have the greatest impact on our planet.","2019-06-21 13:49:18","20","81","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/c3as38/can_you_be_an_environmentalist_and_not_a_vegan/","True","jakeybojangles","1747920334.973488","carbon footprint","manual"
