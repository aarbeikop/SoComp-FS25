I am bit similarly disillusioned that we could ever stop what has already been set in motion by our society, lifestyles and economy in general. Money seems to rule everything and thus makes sustainability next to impossible. But we have to at least try to do our part. 

We must not give up, we must not let the greedy bastards in power to get away with destroying mankind so easily. We must at least make ourselves heard. If the corporations did similar actions as many of the individuals are doing, it would make a huge difference. Our voice is growing and people are starting more and more demand actions each day. At some point they will be impossible to ignore anymore. This is what we can and must do, no matter what the outcome is. We may not be able to stop the impending doom but we sure as hell wont go out quietly.

I don't like our economic system, and to be fair it is based on surreal principles, such as endless growth. However untill we change our economic structures, the best thing we can do is show ""the market"" we no longer blindly consume.
That sustainability can be 'profitable' (since that is their end goal obv)

And even though the average 'consumer' is by far not the biggest polluter; no rain drop tends to feel responsible for the flood.

I believe that everyone should apply as much sustainable principles as possible (regardless of the relative influence it has, unless negative of course).
For the main reason that if the current generations grow up in a world full of sustainable principle, sustainability will become a norm and compassion for the environment will become intrinsic.

We practice permaculture, but still find ourselves reliant on using cheap energy to make our lives easier (chainsaws for example).  At the end of the day, accepting that doing better is better than doing nothing at all, it allows you to be effective instead of wallowing in the impossibility of living within this failing construct.  

Further, we have discovered that the path towards anything of meaning was to build towards community resiliency. Our community has a really nice pocket of folks (albeit a small percentage of the greater community) where barter, sharing of information, and volunteering of time are practiced.  I don’t know how things will shake out, but finding a small resilient community, or carving one out of your current locale, is probably the best way to put your energy into.  If anything, growing your own food from seeds you collect and trade within your community, using compost you build yourself, at the very least, affords you freedom from being dependent on the system.

I highly recommend folks out there who are interested in this lifestyle to seek out work-trade opportunities on small-scale homesteads/farms through wwoof or workaway.  It’s a great way to learn and seek out communities where this type of lifestyle is important.","2019-01-23 17:24:25","20","AmpLee","1747906685.454496","carbon footprint","manual"

But we don't lie down and die, just because we see our own deaths coming. We achieve this either by deluding ourselves or simply forgetting, but most of us manage. The death of our civilization doesn't need to be any different.

Here's the thing: no matter how conscious we are as individuals about where this is all headed, if we stop running with the herd we will be trampled. We've constructed a system in which participation in the apocalypse is not only rational, but mandatory. It's not *optional* to have a job, because we've decided as a society that our right to exist is proportional to the profitability of our skillset. That is, we've decided that homelessness and poverty are acceptable consequences of an inadequately funded welfare state. We'd rather buy that last Bic Mac than let a single mother of two have access to daycare. That is what we have decided.

So I have no illusions about the cruelty, stupidity, and ignorance of the common voter, but I still intend to have my kicks while I'm here. What I won't do is starve myself of all the perks of life in the West, because my non-participation isn't going to change a damn thing. People who say ""a little bit is better than nothing at all"" have never taken a course in real analysis. Some things are so negligible that they aren't even *measurable*. I will not martyr myself for an *immeasurably* small impact. The self-satisfaction - objectively the only thing such a sacrifice would achieve - will not outweigh the cost. It's a fatalistic view, but it's also liberating. It frees me of any delusions that I can make a difference. I am a cell in the superorganism, and the superorganism is going to kill itself whether I object or not. The ride's going to come to an end, one way or another, so I may as well put my feet up, have a drink, and enjoy the scenery.

Now, I'm a deeply troubled and depressed person for other reasons, but that's how I feel about it on an intellectual level. In reality, my dark moods sometimes manifest as ecological pessimism. But if I weren't a deeply closeted and confused trans person starved of meaningful human contact, that would probably be different.

2. You learn valuable skills. Realising that I had no control over my food security is what made me want to homestead. If you can grow food, build and maintain things, are conscious of your waste and its disposal, you're much more resilient regardless of what happens on a grand scale. 

3. It reconnects you to your community. The market economy thrives on social atomisation. When people are disconnected from each other, they can't consolidate their power or effectively advocate for themselves. By reconnecting you become stronger than yourself.

For me the things that have helped put our predicament into perspective are astronomy and gardening.

Astronomy puts us in our place. We, and our civilization are less than a speck. Totally insignificant, doomed from the beginning. That’s the reality no matter how sweet the Star Trek siren song. Going to the stars was never anymore realistic than the Protestant Rapture.

Gardening gets us back to life’s cycles. It connects us with the soil and what keeps us alive.

Going green as it’s called is just a healthier lifestyle. A hot cup of coffee in the morning is small pleasure enjoyed almost everywhere. A Keurig is pointless. 

I try to keep morality out of the equation. While as individuals doing what we believe is morally the better choice, it never stays at that level. Ever. Once we, as individuals or as a group, decide that a particular course of action is the morally appropriate one, individual and collectively we become judgemental of others who don’t share our beliefs. And beliefs are all that they are. Worse, have ascribed morality to a particular course of action, we are even less inclined to change our behaviour even when confronted with objective facts that contradict our views. Tl;dr using morality to justify action leads to mischief and more problems than it solves.

Vitamin D is important for people who live up north, are in winter, and/or are usually indoors. 

DHA (long-chain omega-3 fatty acids) are a requirement for our body, but there’s not much clarity as to how to do so for vegans. Flax, chia, etc. provide us with ALA, which can be converted to EPA then DHA. But the amount of ALA converted is low, and sometimes too low. In order to maximize the conversion, the omega 6:3 ratio must be minimized to less than 4:1. That means no oils, and few fats in general. Algae oil DHA supplements are an option, but I personally believe that 2 tbsp of flaxseeds per day should suffice for most in terms of DHA. 

For iron, make sure to eat plenty of legumes and dark leafy greens. Along with that, eat Vitamin C with meals and avoid tea and caffeine with meals. This will help the non-heme iron in plants be better absorbed. 

The best way to be healthy on a vegan diet is with a WFPB (whole food plant-based) diet. It basically means *eat as grown*. No animal products and no processed foods (including *no oils*). When done right, you can be basically disease-proof. The diet has reversed many chronic diseases. Due to the low calorie density and high fiber content of unprocessed fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, eating this way is not restrictive at all.

I didn't go vegetarian for sustainability reasons though, just for reasons of personal taste - the texture of meat and fish bother me a lot, and I hate the idea of putting dead animals in my mouth for some reason. (Not being sarcastic, I genuinely do wonder why that is, since most of the population seem totally fine with putting dead animals in their mouths! I'm not typically an easily disgusted person so yeah, it's weird.)

I guess my tip for being vegetarian is to find meat and fish disgusting in some way...?! That's not very helpful. Hm. Alright, so I think probably my main feeling about this is that sustainability and food organisations and reports like the [EAT-Lancet](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/) commission say that *reducing* meat and fish is necessary, but they don't advocate for going totally vegetarian. So if you don't want to go vegetarian in one fell swoop, I feel it's okay to still have a bit every day, in smaller amounts. Even in slightly reduced amounts! Like, any reduction in the global consumption of meat and fish is a good reduction, so don't beat yourself up about it.

On an individual level, for a lot of people the most long-lasting changes come from small habit adjustments and very gradual shifts. So it's like, maybe one day pick up an egg mayo sandwich instead of a ham sandwich and be like, yeah, good work, pat on the back. Maybe one day it'll feel natural to you to commit to vegetarian lunches at work or something, even just for a little while as an experiment. Meat-free Mondays are apparently a thing, and that sounds attainable too. But even just, like, buying a nut-based energy bar instead of jerky as a snack *one time*, right? Even that is a good step.

Maybe down the track we'll make it 3 dinners a week, but small steps for now! ","2019-01-23 01:47:50","5","UnicornPenguinCat","1747907266.9329789","carbon footprint","manual"

"eer0a2w","t3_airl7n","airl7n","sustainability","action-oriented","Since other people are talking about reducing meat consumption or switching to different meats, I want to throw out there that hunting and fishing are sustainable ways to continue to eat meat (in the United States). Not only are most wild game and fish populations carefully monitored by state DNR and federal Fish and Wildlife bureaus, but you’re actually helping to correct previous wildlife management mistakes: from introducing invasive species that choke out native species, to controlling populations that historically would have been controlled by predator populations we’ve endangered or pushed out due to urban sprawl. The money from your licenses and tags goes towards supporting the populations of wildlife and their habitats and towards improving state and federal forests and protected spaces.

If you choose to only eat what you, yourself, are able to harvest (and not buy from factory farms via supermarkets, you’re forced to ration and conserve what meat you do have, overall reducing your meat consumption (very few people bag enough deer to maintain similar levels of average beef consumption, for example).

Honestly, it’s only because of the propaganda from factory farms and supermarkets selections that we’re all somewhat vaguely disgusted by any other animal product that isn’t beef, pork or chicken (with the odd holiday turkey/goose/duck thrown in). And for fish, cod, factory farmed salmon, high-pressured tuna schools, and factory farmed tilapia.

My family is steadily switching all our meat consumption to game meat. We’ve made the switch from beef to venison, and this year I’m learning how to hunt turkey and rabbit. And we’ve always ate what fish we caught.","2019-01-23 05:51:53","4","IamNotPersephone","1747907266.935961","carbon footprint","manual"
