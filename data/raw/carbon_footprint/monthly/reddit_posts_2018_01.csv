[From the Digiconomist:](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)

>By the end of 2018, this means that “the Bitcoin network could potentially draw more than 13,500 megawatts/hour (120 terawatt-hours/year)”, or even 16,000 megawatts/hour (140 terawatt-hours/year) based on “90% utilization and 60% direct electricity usage”.

So, right now we're looking at 45 Twh of electricity use. By the end of 2018, we're looking at 120 or 140 Twh.  How much electricity are we talking about here? What else could we have done with this electricity?

Well, here's a comparison. How much electricity is used by:

-The entire LEGO company, with all of its factories, stores and offices? [0.36 Twh](http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/05/lego-just-smashed-its-100-renewable-energy-goal/)

-The entire Dutch train network? [1.2 Twh.](https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/waar-komt-al-die-groene-stroom-van-de-ns-vandaan)

-All of Google's datacenters? [5.7 Twh.](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38227491)

Cryptocurrency is a fine invention, but Bitcoin was designed as a proof of concept that ran out of control because it grew popular much faster than anyone anticipated. That's the reason Satoshi Nakamoto left the project.

Selling your bitcoins is the easiest way you can reduce your carbon footprint. By selling Bitcoin, you reduce the value of bitcoin. By reducing the value of bitcoin, miners can throw less money at mining Bitcoin. When they can spend less money on mining bitcoin, bitcoin ends up consuming less energy.

Something else can perfectly replace bitcoin. There are a lot of cryptocurrencies out there that use far less energy than bitcoin. As an example, consider a proof of stake coin. In a proof of stake coin, no energy is used to produce new coins, while you can earn interest.

Is this collapse related? It's very collapse related. If you are a bitcoin owner, selling your bitcoins is the single best thing you can do for the environment. Ditching meat, a vasectomy, selling your car, all of these actions are a small drop in the bucket at best, compared to what you can do by selling your bitcoins. 

The best thing about it is: This doesn't have to cost you anything. Bitcoin is an investment you made, because you think it will deliver you money. The reality is that Bitcoin can't realistically grow much more in value. In contrast, the energy-efficient cryptocurrencies out there, still have a lot of potential to grow in value. There are many energy-efficient currencies out there, I will not name the ones I invested in myself. You are free to type ""proof of stake"" into Google.

I'm begging you to take this post serious and to recognize the importance of this issue. I consider this the easiest and most cost-effective thing we can do to reduce our environmental impact. Please move your cryptocurrency investments to an energy-efficient alternative today.
