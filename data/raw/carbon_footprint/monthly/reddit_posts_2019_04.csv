"bepssk","climatechange","action-oriented","EPA residential Greenhouse Gas Calculator","I live in Southern Indiana and was researching the EPA residential Greenhouse Gas Calculator.   Here's a link: [https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/](https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/).

I decided to find out how the various energy sources compared so I entered $100.00/month for Natural Gas, Electricity, Fuel Oil and Propane.  I was a surprised that the highest carbon emitter per $100 was electricity.  I guess this says electricity in Indiana relies too much on fossil fuels, like coal, AND that electricity is cheap, meaning you get a lot of electricity for $100 and therefore a lot of coal goes into its generation.  

My follow-up question, since far too much electricity in Southern Indiana is generated with coal, would I be better off heating my house and hot water with natural gas until such time that the local electricity is more environmentally friendly?  I realize I could install solar or wind and make my own, cleaner electricity, I'm simply wanting to understand the two current options.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts.","2019-04-18 19:41:12","6","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bepssk/epa_residential_greenhouse_gas_calculator/","True","bikeguy1959","1747911374.0727522","carbon footprint","manual"
"bhus28","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","What to put on a handout sheet?","So I'm fortunate enough to work in a job where I can talk to small groups of people everyday about a topic more or less having to do with nature and the environment. 

I'm trying to put together a paper hand out I can give to people to spread awareness about global warming and what they can do to shrink their carbon footprint.

To save on resources (paper, ink) I'm limiting the handouts to what I can put on a 1/4 or 1/2 sheet of paper. 

On ONE SIDE, I have the typical ways of shrinking your foot print:

>Eat less meat  
Use less plastic  
Consume less  
Buy used where possible  
Refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, recycle, rot  
Drive less - walk, bike, carpool, take public transit  
Avoid flying by plane  
Buy locally  
Compost green waste  
Plant a tree or ten (native species)  
Wash clothes in cold water/hang dry  
Use less electricity  
Donate to environmental causes    
Research and spread awareness  
Talk to your representatives about renewables and vote

But I'm lost on what exactly I can put on the other side of the sheet, info wise.

I work in government, so I can't really come at it from too biased of an angle (""Vote dem/green!""), and it has to be professional. (I might be able to talk a little about Greta Thunberg, but not necessarily Extinction Rebellion, for example.)

Ideas? Maybe some credible websites, list some documentaries to watch, some social media hashtags? But which? As much as I LOVE me some good graphics, I want to keep them to a minimum because the 1/4-1/2 size page limit.","2019-04-27 02:53:34","3","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/bhus28/what_to_put_on_a_handout_sheet/","True","rezkidsinlove","1747911533.502233","carbon footprint","manual"
"bhz4be","environment","emotional","Question: Precise information on how to reduce carbon footprint? And why are a few companies said to have a disproportionate big influence?","This is a two-fold question:

1. I am looking for food and precise information on how to reduce my personal carbon footprint. I've looked at a few carbon footprint calculators. Most of them seem to be assuming you live in the US, with the associated life style. Many promote ""carbon compensation""  schemes for plane travel which I think can't work, as we simply can't plant so many billions of trees to compensate for extraction of  carbon that was deposited and fossilized over hundred of millions of years. And quite a few also seem to be data-gathering devices which is suspicious at best (asking for email, zip code, income and so on). However I found the carbon footprint calculator from the German Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency), which looks quite good: https://uba.co2-rechner.de/de_DE/ . It turns out that in my personal case, I seem to be able to reduce my footprint by 30% by just stopping flying. That's very helpful. But I feel I need more precise and better information, for example on consumer articles, clothing and so on.

2. Some climate activists say that very few large corporations cause the bulk of global emissions. Is this true? Where can I learn more about that?","2019-04-27 13:34:42","8","2","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bhz4be/question_precise_information_on_how_to_reduce/","True","Alexander_Selkirk","1747911610.759945","carbon footprint","manual"

“I do everything I can to have a small carbon footprint”

“I drive a Prius, recycle and reuse grocery bags”

When did we forget that we could actually IMPROVE the environment? It seems that everything has turned into “I am inherently evil so I’ll try to minimize the damage.”

Why are people trying to be carbon neutral when you can be carbon negative? Why do people get arrogantly snobby about their small carbon footprint? It makes ZERO sense to try to stop at 0 carbon when you could be -100.

We need a new narrative that doesn’t give you any props for having a small carbon footprint. You might as well just not exist. You should get props for being carbon negative and for improving the environment, not just minimizing the damage. 

There are a million ways to actually improve the environment. You can be a net positive. Your existence is not inherently evil. 

You can:

Turn a lawn into habitat for birds and insects

Put structure into a stream so it bends which creates habitat for fish and wildlife 

Plant trees

Make a compost pile and improve your local soil

Educate others on beneficial things to do

Inoculate dead logs and soils with fungi 

Put up bird and bat boxes 

Create habitat for locally important species

Spread seeds of native species 

Participate in habitat restoration projects 

You can have a positive impact on your local environment. 

For anyone that says “ it’s too late, this shit doesn’t matter”, yeah, civilization is going to collapse, but we don’t know what collapse will look like. Every little bit that we do just might nudge things enough so that humans don’t go extinct, or maybe mammals don’t go extinct, or... maybe we do enough so that some insect life hangs on... who knows... but it is still worth the effort.","2019-04-30 21:03:28","84","52","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bj8ltx/our_moral_duty_is_not_to_just_minimize_our/","True","ogretronz","1747911854.6944032","carbon footprint","manual"
"bbk9xv","collapse","skeptical","Isn't denying that overpopulation is a problem racist?","By saying that ""population size isn't a problem, it's the First World's consumption and emission per capita that is problematic"", don't you imply that people from poor countries still undergoing population explosion are in your opinion never destined to reach semblance of normal civilized life (with reduced infant mortality and extended life expectancy, access to communal services, not living in poverty and squalor) which usually goes hand in hand with, you know, increased energy consumption and carbon footprint per capita?

&#x200B;

When people talk about ""Earth being able to sustain N billions, overpopulation isn't a thing"", what kind of living standards for these billions do they have in mind? What factors of ""sustainability"" do they take into account (only amount of arable land, or renewable or at least low-carbon energy output needed to ensure certain level of productivity of this land?). And isn't this subreddit largely dedicated to concerns about carrying capacity of Earth for humankind inevitably shrinking in the future, possibly to zero?

It's easy to assign blame for something that has already happened (Europe being densely populated and rich).

The plan for this is to list possible ways of solving or easing our climate dilemma. If you have an idea to add please leave a comment and I will revise this. I don't really feel like I've added any new ideas here yet, but I'm hopeful someone will. In either case I thought it might be both beneficial and therapeutic.

**Global scale:**

1. Admit that we are facing serious global ecological problems.
2. Cut reliance on fossil fuels and plastics in order to further reduce  carbon emissions and global pollution. Replacement forms of energy and production materials already exist!!!
3. Cleanse ocean gyres with a combination of surface skims, nets and dredge techniques.
4. Major waterways contributing to ocean pollution be fitted with some sort of filtration systems to be maintained and emptied.
5. Global reforestation efforts with local flora, not just a single  species. (The idea is recreating the habitat we've destroyed, anything less is useless.)

**National scale:**

1. Retrofit efforts for existing vehicles or some method of taking them out of circulation without hardship to owners.
2. Grants or some sort of funding for switching to renewable energy sources. Possibly provided via a carbon tax.

**Individual scale:**

1. Fight propaganda.
2. Consume less.
3. Donate time and effort, get involved locally.
4. Contact local leadership/government and voice concerns and possible solutions.
5. Know that your voice and your spending habits both exert power. It is hard not to support the fossil fuel industry in some manner, but when able we must navigate around them.

Edit: I'm hearing a lot of cleverly worded give up. I expected some from where this was posted I didn't expect it to be the majority. My mistake. On the off chance that someone comes a long who hasn't had their spirit crushed I'll update.

It's more than possible I'm being naive in thinking anything can be done, I'm just not programmed to roll over. I'll still be enjoying life as I can, spending time with friends and family. Only now some part of my processing power is constantly chewing on this. Base principle; prevent what you can, prepare for what you expect, deal with the rest. On the off chance that something done improves chances of species survival it can't be wasted effort on a grand-scale. I mean... you could assuredly argue otherwise but this will remain my outlook.

"bbt6zy","collapse","skeptical","Future of Sports","I wonder how long before there will be no Olympics and multi-million dollar leagues such as MLB, NFL, EPL etc. and the hundreds of stadiums are abandoned permanently. Already the 2026 Winter Olympics are finding it hard to find a host city after 5 of the 7 candidate cities withdrew their interest, and the remaining 2 include Milan, Italy, a country in severe financial crises.

Recent Olympic cities such as Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 already have abandoned dozens of the arenas and facilities with Rio 2016 destined for the same fate surely. In the end sports is just entertainment and has an enormous carbon footprint, think of the cost and C footprint of having indoor ice hockey stadiums in cities like Tampa, FL or LA. When shtf in a few years and it is too hot outside and hard to feed the population then sports and associated industries such as tourism will be the first to go.
