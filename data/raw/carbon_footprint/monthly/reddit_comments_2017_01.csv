It will definitely need more development as time goes on but this could be a great tool for people who want to be more educated about their environmental impact in daily life. I know some teachers and I will definitely pass this on to share with students","2017-01-02 18:18:47","2","inthismoment515","1747866715.483663","carbon footprint","manual"

There are a lot of things that you can do to improve your buildings sustainability. Never underestimate a good recycling program. Contact your city and ask for recycling been there might be a small fee for it but it's usually worth it and affordable specially for a company. You can try and implement certain things that prevent food waste such as composting. You could do motion sensor lights in the bathrooms you just have to set the sensor for a little bit longer for people who take their time but it's a very effective way to cut down on energy cost considering that you don't have to leave a light on all day. If your company purchases small silverware or paper towels or napkins you can always get recycled products instead of brand-new products. Sustainability is also about health, you could do things like no elevator Fridays. Not everyone will participate but if you leave by example you might get a couple people to join in. You could try and do low flow toilets which are very useful you could also do the timed sink faucets, those prevent water waste. And there's typically not a lot of bathrooms in the building so you should be able to do this for fairly inexpensive.

Of course there's always the extreme things like doing solar panels or like wind generators. But those are much more expensive and difficult options to pursue. Only owners with lots of money would actually go through with something like that. Water conservation, recycling, using recycled materials, and some health initiatives. That's the way to go. Hope this helps good luck.","2017-01-26 04:04:03","6","George__Maharis","1747866719.175148","carbon footprint","manual"

If the building uses a boiler to supply heat to the halls or hot water to the units solar hot water would be great even if it just preheats the incoming water.

For public bathrooms retro fit [dual flush](http://amzn.to/2k7cyb0) toilets. If the toilets have automatic flushing disable it, at my office every time I go to wipe it flushes then I have to manually flush the paper. Also urinals still use about 1gal to rinse a few cups of pee when only a little more water than the p-trap holds is actually needed. Also mechanical flushing works without batteries and last a lot longer.","2017-01-26 13:59:42","2","seanthenry","1747866719.1784809","carbon footprint","manual"
"dcx94jv","t3_5q40yx","5q40yx","sustainability","action-oriented","I designed heat exchangers for my dryer exhaust and furnace exhaust. I havent built them yet. 

I estimate the dryer heat exchanger will cost $60 in material. Its made from a metal 5 gallon bucket and aluminum ducting. 

The furnace exchanger is really just a heatsink or radiator. It uses peltier modules and very low voltage dc motors with fan blades. The idea is for the waste heat to power the fans via the thermo electric effect of the peltiers. It should cost less than $20","2017-01-26 06:25:25","1","cv512hg","1747866719.182131","carbon footprint","manual"
"dcxdppy","t3_5q40yx","5q40yx","sustainability","action-oriented","A building at my university a few years ago was a fantastic example of sustainable design, it achieved a relatively rare six star certification. Although you're not building from scratch, some of the ideas might be possible to retrofit. The article below explains a little bit about it.

"dcykdoy","t3_5q40yx","5q40yx","sustainability","action-oriented","My first suggestion would be Programmable thermostats. If you already have them, then *teaching people how to use them.* I've found that most people don't bother ever actually using them, especially in the office environment. This includes (for offices) getting them turned off on holidays. 

I like George's suggestion of composting. A community compost program would be great for people to not only reduce food waste, but also spread familiarity with the practice.

Third, I'd suggest a rideshare program. The building you manage must be a common destination for a lot of people (be it an office or residence) so just seeing if people are going similar places at similar times may have significant impact. This is also free...

Finally, you can higher an energy auditor to take a look at the building. They'll look for specific weaknesses in your building like insulation, etc. and tell you the most profitable investments. Could be anything from replacing a roof, insulating water lines to planting trees for shade outside.
