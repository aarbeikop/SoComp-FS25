"9uew8c","climatechange","action-oriented","BBC posted a list of ten simple changes anyone can do to reduce carbon footprint","The time to bicker about what is the best way to fight climate change is long gone. EVERYONE needs to be doing EVERYTHING they can to flight climate change.

1. Limit use of fossil fuels.
2. Hold industries accountable by exercising right as a citizen and a consumer.
3. Take public transport as much as possible.
4. Opt for renewable energy wherever possible.
5. Go Vegan or Vegetarian or at the very least reduce meat intake.
6. Reduce taking flights.
7. Buy local.
8. Less children
9. Spread your message
10. Use carbon footprint calculator.

And for the love of God, stop bickering and finding faults with each other. Support anyone and everyone who takes even the tiniest of steps to fight climate change. I am specifically referring to Republics and Democrats who are both passionate about Climate Change. I am also referring to Vegans who have problems with climate change warriors and also climate change warriors who hate Vegans. You are both in the same team. Stop hating each other. Support each other. #EveryBitCounts.

"9t71um","climatechange","action-oriented","Average carbon footprint","Since I'll be voting on a carbon tax initiative, I'm re-familiarizing myself with basics of climate change by reading an essay I wrote in high school (ha). Anyway, I cited a statistic from the EPA's website: ""In the United States, approximately 6.6 tons (almost 15,000 pounds) of [greenhouse gases](https://web.archive.org/web/20000407085600/http://www.epa.gov:80/globalwarming/climate/index.html#GHG) are emitted per person every year."" But Wikipedia and other websites are telling me per capita we're about 16-20 tons per capita for the last 20+ years.

In 2000 the EPA's website said ""Total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions rose in 1997 to 1,813.6 million metric tons of carbon equivalents (MMTCE)"". Today, their website says ""In 2014, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions totaled 6,870 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.""

The graphs I'm seeing show a slight increase, not a dramatic increase in emissions.

In many places wood left  on it's own just decays and the carbon gets released anyway. Burying or utilizing wood permanently is expensive and burdensome, but charcoal can be used for things other than combustion and is less prone to biological decay. It's even lighter. It can be compacted. Why aren't we doing this?

"9vbk4w","environment","emotional","Ask Reddit: Feedback on offsetting carbon footprint by printing using upcycled air pollution? (Fresh off the labs)","Hello reddit hive,

(kind of newbie here)

We are a group of researchers that have been piloting a technology for the last couple years, around air pollution capture and re-use. We would love critique and feedback from the wider community on how can we make this work.

**Background of the Project**

We are a spinoff lab from MIT which conceptualized the idea of recycling air pollution back in 2013. Since then we've been finding ways to make this recycling accepted into our conventional industries.

In parts of India, China, and SE Asia PM levels are so high that we've hazardous smog all the time. Most industrial particulate emissions are *however rich in elemental carbon*, which we learnt *how to utilize*. We created methods to capture/harvest that pollution, and up-cycle it into high grade inks. We were earlier concerned with safety of the inks since they're made from a waste/pollution stream. *We now ensure our inks meet safety standards before they go out of our lab.*

After [earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwy549sOYb8) pilots...We eventually target static sources of pollution. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj9cuVZS-IQ) is one of the ways through which we get our pollution captured from polluting sites (without negative effects on engine). While a lot of polluters are beginning to send their pollution to us.

**Why?**

We want this to take this project beyond its coolness to make larger real world impact. We are exposed to a lot of pollution through air, and water streams because of incorrect disposal of pollution waste. We are trying a new economic model, where the waste that we will work with brands on helping them *reduce* their carbon footprint, marketing tool, and use the *profits* to incentivize the polluters to let us handle their pollution.

**Need feedback on**

* Fashion is one of the most polluting industries in the world. We are now piloting fabric that can be printed with this ink. The idea is that one T-shirt printed from this ink will offset pollution that is released from 40-50 mins worth of diesel car (averaging PM emissions across Euro 4,5 and 6).
* Conventional black-ink is made by deliberately burning fossil fuels to produce carbon pigment. We are not only using AIR-INK to confine that pollution, but replace the conventional fuel burning to produce the pigment. Any ideas on how should we go about quantifying the footprint impact? Or are we overthinking it by getting into footprint calculations.
* We have only tried to do this non-commercially yet via Kickstarter and via collaborations with independent art groups. Is it advisable exploring looking at scaling this up, and getting into sustainable fashion?
* Just like recycling paper symbol has a symbol ♻ ... Our black color looks like other black colors, how do we create a symbol that brings a community of early adopters together?

Here's some fabric we've printed.

Could increasing poverty decrease civilisations carbon footprint?

Or would poor people buying cheap poor quality goods that don't last long increase the churn rate and boost our carbon footprint?
