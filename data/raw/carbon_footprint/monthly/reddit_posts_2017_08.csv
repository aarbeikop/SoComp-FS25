"6x8hmw","collapse","skeptical","An (In)Convenient Excuse","I keep seeing people blame politicians and corporations and and capitalism, Baby Boomers, etc. for climate change. They are taking the easy way out, blaming convenient scapegoats for a collective problem - and also conveniently excusing their own behavior.

The typical U.S. person has a carbon footprint of 20 metric tons annually. Even with effort, the typical conscientious green consumer still can't really get below 8.5 metric tons - there is a carbon floor.

So long as we continue to choose to live in an industrial civilization: drive cars, eat factory farming, take plane rides, use electricity, run air conditioners, heat our homes, buy manufactured goods, etc. then we are complicit. We are choosing convenience and comfort over the hard choices. Every day, we make the easy choice to continue as before.

Anyone has the ability to drop everything to go live a short existence of subsistence living in a tropical forest. That they are not choosing to, tells you what they are prioritizing. (And yes, I'm just as guilty.)

That they are blaming everyone else but themselves tells you that they are willfully ignoring an inconvenient truth.","2017-08-31 17:55:48","26","17","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/6x8hmw/an_inconvenient_excuse/","True","hillsfar","1747877508.1504278","carbon footprint","manual"
