"68if8l","collapse","skeptical","Isn't extreme inequality a blessing in disguise since it reduces the consumption of resources?","The very rich can't eat 30 meals a day. They might use more energy inefficient forms of transportation but they can only use so much.

The very aggregate number of the poorer people means even if their individual ecological footprint might be smaller, overall their impact is not small.

Right now, the only variables we have are climate changes, pollution and resource consumption. The first two are debatable so only resource consumption matters in the end.

If the mass of world pop fall into abject poverty, including a lot of the so-called middle class in the advanced world, then their consumption plummets to the bare minimum (something the denizens of Lagos, Nigeria, will feel the bare minimum, if you know what I mean)and the world gets to keep such resources for better use.

That extends the life span of industrial civilization, although it will mean bad news to the newly poor.

If extreme inequality can extend the show, it will take place. Whether you like or not. Since that is the best alternative out of all bad choices.","2017-04-30 22:52:54","0","40","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/68if8l/isnt_extreme_inequality_a_blessing_in_disguise/","True","kulmthestatusquo","1747871584.439167","carbon footprint","manual"
