Not occasional heroism, a remarkable instance of it here and there, but constant heroism, systematic heroism, heroism as a governing principle. —Russell Banks, Continental Drift, 1985


	 In March 2015, representatives of 186 national governments met in Sendai, a city freshly reconstructed after the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami four years before. The Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction convened to decide on the final text of the so-called Sendai Framework, which would guide national efforts against disaster by setting goals for the year 2030. All of the countries discussed at length in this book—Australia, Russia, the Philippines, the United States, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, China, Bangladesh, Cuba, India, Uganda—were in attendance. (Montserrat joined the drafting of the previous framework in Hyogo, Japan, in 2005, but in 2015 the island was represented only by its territorial master, the United Kingdom.) The Sendai conference started off a year of major UN meetings that would lead up to the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, and from within the climate wars Sendai appeared as an oasis of optimism and easy consensus; after all, everyone agrees that disaster risk must be curbed, and everyone believes that it’s possible to do something about it. The organizers hoped that disasters, as always, would bring people together. And like the climate conferences of recent years, the meeting coincided with a calamity: Cyclone Pam, a storm nearly as strong as Typhoon Yolanda, had bulldozed the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu the day before. The country’s president came to Sendai to plead before the delegates, urging them to take real action. Action proved not so easy to plan. Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager at the organization ActionAid, reported from within the conference: The draft document . . . had taken a major leap by proposing specific targets for reducing disaster risks. All [seven] targets had different options of specific numbers but six out of them have now ended up without numbers and just with the subjective language suggesting “substantial” progress in comparison to the last ten years. 


	The only target that is currently under intense negotiations is around international cooperation that includes providing financial and other support to developing countries. Facing the heat at climate negotiations year-on-year, developed countries are in no mood to concede to the demands of “additional and predictable” funding for developing countries. The negotiations dragged late into the final night. The members of a children’s choir, standing by to sing at the closing ceremony, were sent home to bed. Jokesters from one aid organization delivered cases of emergency food and water rations to the assembly hall where delegates sat trapped. Finally, fear of commitment won out. The final version adopted all of the watered-down goals and dropped the mention of “additional and predictable” in favor of “adequate and sustainable” funding, an objective rich countries could interpret at will. The United States blocked a section on sharing technology with poorer countries, fearing for intellectual property. Only the host country, Japan, put actual money on the table, pledging $4 billion over four years to support disaster efforts in developing countries. At the end of that year, rich countries would follow a similar playbook to soften the Paris climate agreement, deflecting further attempts to hold them accountable by, among others, a Philippines-led bloc called the Vulnerable Twenty. 


	For the foreseeable future, it seems, the global South will see neither reparations for loss and damage nor an international disaster fund. What did shine through at Sendai was the doctrine of resilience. In the 166 pages of the conference proceedings, the words “resilience” and “resilient” are used 364 times, while “vulnerable” and “vulnerability” appeared only fifty times and even “hazard” only ninety-six. Instead of action, resources, or technology, the people of nations such as Vanuatu were offered advice on how to become resilient on their own. 


	To live resiliently, we’re told, communities have to abandon as a mirage the old promises of security and development and embrace a dizzying world of unpredictable hazards. They have to open themselves up to catastrophe; like the painter Cézanne, they must become one with the rainbow of chaos in which they practice their arts. The reward for this is not stability and security but nimbleness, adaptability, survival. For Brad Evans and Julian Reid, the most prominent theorists who have examined resilience with a critical eye, it also means a managed retreat from our hopes for the future. They argue that “accepting the imperative to become resilient means sacrificing any political vision of a world in which we might be able to live better lives freer from dangers, looking instead at the future as an endemic terrain of catastrophe that is dangerous and insecure by design."" After publishing their 2014 book Resilient Life, in fact, Evans and Reid decided the whole discourse had gone down a cul-de-sac from which it could never emerge. When the journal Resilience dedicated an entire issue to analyses of their book, they responded with a renunciation: And to repeat, we are also exhausted by resilience. Its nihilism is devastating. Its political language enslaving. Its modes of subjectivity lamenting. And its political imagination notably absent. That is why we have decided after this volume to never write, publicly lecture or debate the problematic again. We will not engage with those who would have us brought into some dialectical orbit in order to validate its reverence by making it some master signifier in order to prove its majoritarian position. Yes, the doctrine of resilience at the level of policy and power is ubiquitous. And yet in terms of emancipating the political, it is already dead.


	 The suspicion that resilience is simply one more scheme for protecting the status quo has dogged the concept ever since it entered the social realm. There have, however, been attempts to retrofit resilience with a capacity for radical transformation. In C.S. Holling’s later social-ecological work, he has expanded on his adaptive cycle (the famous figure-eight diagram) with pathways called “revolt” and “remembrance,” the former having the capacity to carry change up to larger scales of the system and enact abrupt or transformational learning. In this version, nested loops of resilience can be infected by change from below or contain it from above. Geographer Mark Pelling has promoted the related concept of “transformative adaptation,” a nonlinear change in a system caused by dissatisfaction with the status quo. In a study with David Manuel-Navarrete of two coastal towns in Mexico, Pelling used the resilience lens to show the internal contradictions that maintain a rigid governance regime and development pathway pointing away from climate adaptation. The researchers observed that a direct hit from Hurricane Dean in 2007 instigated transformation away from this institutionalized state, as residents organized themselves newly during reconstruction—but, like Occupy Sandy years later, these were temporary transformations, far from the centers of power, and their achievements were quickly reabsorbed into the rigid whole. In this and other work Pelling identified different forms of resilience that can either hold a society to a set path or break it free. His notion of transformative adaptation was eventually included in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, of which he was an author. Meanwhile, Kevin Grove has described more subversive local interpretations of resilience in Jamaica, running quietly alongside the development doctrine. Subversive resilience reaches for an empowerment that exceeds the neoliberal definition of helping individuals make proper adaptation decisions. 


	On the one hand, resilience-building programming facilitated communities’ access to resources from state or international agencies by teaching them to translate their needs into the terminology of the donors, in much the same way that Don Romeo is urging Montserratians to block all British attempts to run out the clock. This is not a capture of local struggles by outsiders; instead—drawing on familiar themes from anticolonial resistance—it secures a negotiated self-determination while keeping alive the potential for alternative social and ecological futures. Another neoliberal message, communities’ responsibility for their own survival, resonated in Jamaica with Christian and Rastafarian belief in being “your brother’s keeper,” with the potential to be affected by others’ suffering, and with the history of resistance to race-based oppression. Thus, where Evans and Reid saw neoliberal resilience foreclosing on alternatives, Grove saw it shadowed by other, often hidden transcripts. “Resilience is saturated with the potential to be otherwise,” he wrote, “and can thus be both radical and reactionary at one and the same time. Resilience techniques and rationalities articulate with other cultural, political economic and ecological trajectories in ways that create new possibilities for both power and resistance."" It’s starting to look as if resilience can be anything and anything can be resilient. This is close to the truth. 


	Resilience is not a normative concept—it includes no built-in “performance measures,” no innate morality. To deploy it is to deploy a set of definitions, what ecologists call “defining the resilience of what to what."" A city can be resilient to an earthquake, but a dictatorship can also be resilient to dissent. Diseases, invasive weeds, and fire ants are resilient to extermination. Patriarchy and apartheid are resilient to justice. The world’s most destructive corporations spend millions of dollars planning their resilience to everything. An international terrorist network is a master class in resilient design. Resilience is an art as much of the powerful as of the powerless. Of course, the powerful are much better at it, and they seldom get their own feet wet. As Zygmunt Bauman, the sociologist of liquid modernity, wrote, “The prime technique of power is now escape, slippage, elision and avoidance, the effective rejection of any territorial confinement with its cumbersome corollaries of order-building, order-maintenance and the responsibility for the consequences of it all as well as of the necessity to bear their costs. . . . Holding to the ground is not that important if the ground can be reached and abandoned at whim, in a short time or in no time."" This is the same dance we expect of the poor, but the rich are its adepts. Regarding them, Bauman warned, “Attempts to anticipate their moves and the unanticipated consequences of their moves (let alone the efforts to avert or arrest the most undesirable among them) have a practical effectivity not unlike that of a League to Prevent Weather Change."" 



	If resilience methods entail a decentralization of responsibility for disaster management, then where does power lie within the system? There are clues in the standard definitions of resilience, such as the Sendai Framework’s: The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions. The phrase “essential basic structures and functions,” or something like it, lingers vaguely inside many such definitions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change replaces it with “essential function, identity, and structure."" But what are the essential functions of a community? Resilience hinges on the power to define them. Once we start defining, the questions start coming and don’t stop. Is a community’s essential function to provide its members with bodily security, a healthy environment, and natural resources? Is it to offer livelihood opportunities—and if so, how good should they be? Is it essential that the community provide something to the outside world as well? If we observe that one essential function of a slum is to absorb risks from surrounding areas, do the residents have to accept this as part of their role? If we observe that one of the essential functions of an American suburb is to be a thirsty market for fossil fuels, do its residents (and the rest of us) have to accept that? To remain itself, must a community maintain its function and structure in a particular place—or will it still be the same community if it’s thirty or three thousand miles away, out of range of the storm surge, mud volcano, or fire? What if that hazard is also the source of livelihood? Conversely, is it the same community if the settlement stays put but the people change? In Australia and Russia, can human resilience build on the concept’s volatile ecological fundamentals? Do fires threaten us, or do invasive species (like us) threaten fire regimes? Are fires sustaining or destroying the functionality of the landscape? Are the fires of the fossil fuel economy sustaining or destroying the world? In the Philippines, can cultural mechanisms of solidarity, risk acceptance, and a healthy cynicism continue to sustain the indomitable poor as they strive to live and work in the country’s most hazardous zones? Do these tools increase Filipinos’ resilience or deepen their vulnerability? Do perpetual cycles of disaster make the country what it is or keep it from becoming something more? In New York, would the Lower East Side become more resilient with the importation of a different, wealthier group of residents, or is it essential that the neighborhood function as a safe and pleasant home for the people who live there now? When homeowners on Staten Island fight for the right to retreat and to let their former neighborhoods become Phragmites wetlands, do these areas cease to become a functional part of the city, or do they gain a new, stronger function? Has the Lusi mudflow victims’ determination to fight the corporation that buried their home been an essential part of their resilience? Did the Bakrie conglomerate prove to be even more resilient in the face of that rebellion, ducking its responsibilities for nine long years and living on to keep creating fresh hazards with its mining and pumping? When the resilient poor come up against the resilient rich, is it a clash of functions or a class war? Where did the system fail in the L’Aquila earthquake? Was it the function of science to interject lifesaving signals into the city? Or was science just a scapegoat for a government that failed to do its duty? And can a new, more resilient L’Aquila survive the hole in its heart where the old city was? Is Miami the least resilient city in the United States or the most? In denying the importance of geographic place in favor of a wholly economic resilience—a plan that says to get out of town at the first sight of surging water or falling property values—has this metropolis built on swamp and sand in the hurricane belt become no more than a fragile Ponzi scheme? Or is it the future: a trillion-dollar tent city for a nomadic society? Will Mumbai, Kampala, and other cities of the global South become even more central to the global economy and ecology than Miami and Rotterdam? Their slums are very much part of the urban machine, but to what end? Do they recycle hazard into innovation or just soak it up? Is their life of risk and repair a service that slum dwellers provide to the city, or has their city failed them? Can a people living on one-third of a tiny island keep finding silver linings in anything the Earth chooses to hit them with? Should they have to? If Montserrat has outlived its function in a colonial system of exploitation, is it time to call it quits? Or, once the Soufrière Hills have quieted down, will the intense desire to live again in “the Caribbean the way it used to be” draw the community back to the island’s twice-destroyed south? And would doing that show resilience or recklessness? Is the function of a rural Kansas town simply to give people a place to live and work, or is its carbon footprint also part of its (dys)function? Is the new Greensburg’s greenness intimately tied to the whole of the atmosphere, as its planners and architects maintained, or is it just an economic development strategy unrelated to climate change? If Greensburg is rebuilt green and the population doesn’t come back, has it still proved its resilience? Will it become a frontier town of post-carbon America or just another traffic light on U.S. 54? Finally, in Uttarakhand, what is more resilient: to rebuild the roads to the four holy temples in order to keep the pilgrimage economy going, or to withdraw, allowing the gods to reclaim their abodes and the people their forests? Does hydroelectric development need to bounce back from the floods and landslides of 2013, or does Uttarakhand need to bounce back from hydroelectric? Do the sources of the Ganges function as a spiritual landscape for all Hindus, a renewable power source for all Indians, a fragile ecosystem, or a homeland? No model will get us out of answering questions like these.


	 The hinges of resilience—of “resilience of what to what”—are moral questions, political questions. They are decisions about what we should change in the name of adaptation and what we should defend to the bitter end. Who gets the power to answer these questions? Catastrophic events might sound a wake-up call, but they won’t naturally, effortlessly lead us to the right answers; they can too easily be hijacked. Fitting events into the existing shape of individual, state, or corporate agendas is something everyone is skilled at. From this perspective it looks as if it’s those in the economic power centers of the neoliberal world, the disciples of creative destruction, who are best placed to master resilience. This is their claim on the future. And it must be contested: their resilience is catastrophic by design, morally unhinged, because it counts on the vulnerable to absorb what the market sheds so that the market’s irreparable fragility can be conserved. The vulnerable and the marginalized must have power, but not just the power to adapt; they must recapture the terms of adaptation, recapture the means by which a consensus of the vulnerable is possible. The fundamental choices are rightfully theirs. The answers should not belong to those who float free in the rainbow of chaos, never setting foot in the mud and ash and black water of disaster.","2016-12-07 13:14:29","3","10","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5gzt0s/catastrophic_events_might_sound_a_wakeup_call_but/","True","gitacritic","1747864444.5617201","carbon footprint","manual"
"5jbye8","sustainability","action-oriented","A wiki for the environmental impact of goods and services (carbon footprint, water consumption, material use).","When I want to consider the environment in my decision to purchase a product or change a behavior it is often difficult to obtain objective information on which to base the decision. Search results frequently yield articles without many useful facts or mention of where the author obtained their information. I want quantitive information, like that found on nutrition labels, that can be used to quickly compare products and measure my impact on the planet. 

In October I began collecting the information I found about product environmental impacts using an [open-edit wiki](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Main_Page) platform. The focus has been mostly on **quantitative information** about goods and services including:

- Greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint)
- Water consumption
- Energy use
- Material use

The goal is to facilitate quick comparisons between options and allow users to learn the effect a decision will have on a person’s overall impact on the environment. Additionally, we can prevent duplicate efforts by making the research, that many people may already be doing, publicly available for collaboration.

The wiki currently contains about 90 product and comparison pages. The [product pages](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Category:Product) provide a concise account of the environmental impact of a single product or service. These articles often detail how each stage of a product’s life cycle contributes to its overall environmental impact. The [comparison pages](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Category:Comparison) include tables that allow quick comparisons to be made between similar products.

The website uses the same software as Wikipedia, so it allows for collaborative editing. You are welcome to utilize the wiki and contribute citable information that others can use when making purchasing decisions.

Edit: The URL is [wikifootprints.org](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Main_Page)

TL;DR: Created an [open-edit wiki](http://wikifootprints.org/en/Main_Page) for product environmental impacts. Please use the information to decrease your footprint, and contribute information if you can.
