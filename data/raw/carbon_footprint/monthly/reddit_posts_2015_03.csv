*Did/do you think that the situation can/could be reversed and that we (humans) would/will do what was needed to be done years ago and didn’t?”*

I feel I’ve listened to enough experts, read enough scientific reports, lurked around enough internet forums, and observed my fellow man enough to say that there is no point in trying to keep up with the latest newsbite for any sign of real change in the status quo. I see that the IPCC is consistently overly conservative and in fact incorporates into its global warming projections the [assumption that we will invent technologies to pull CO2 from the atmosphere](http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2772427/survivable_ipcc_projections_are_based_on_science_fiction_the_reality_is_much_worse.html) in order to avoid the worst-case scenarios. The IPCC also [does not event count](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12525) the CO2 emissions from the single largest polluter on the planet -the U.S. Military. No government has a coherent plan and in fact repeatedly works to undermine any such plan that is intended to deal with the collapsing biosphere. For instance, CO2 emissions from First World countries were simply [off-shored to developing countries](https://www.youtube.com/embed/E2QkkgNDV3Y). Pete Dolack of [Systemic Disorder](http://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/) blog told me these new trade agreements like the TPP would “speed up global warming and other environmental destruction.” Anything that interferes with more and more growth is eliminated or disregarded because economic growth is what generates profit and tax revenue to keep the whole Ponzi scheme going. From one of Pete Dolack’s recent essays:

>…The earliest countries that adopted capitalism could “export” their “excess” population though mass emigration. From 1820 to 1915, Professors Foster and McChesney write, more than 50 million people left Europe for the “new world.” But there are no longer such places for developing countries to send the people for whom capitalism at home can not supply employment. Not even a seven percent growth rate for 50 years across the entire global South could absorb more than a third of the peasantry leaving the countryside for cities, they write. Such a sustained growth rate is extremely unlikely.

>As with the growing environmental crisis, these mounting economic problems are functions of the need for ceaseless growth. Once again, infinite growth is not possible on a finite planet, especially one that is approaching its limits. Worse, to keep the system functioning at all, the [planned obsolescence of consumer products](https://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/the-high-cost-of-new-and-improved/) necessary to continually stimulate household spending accelerates the exploitation of natural resources at unsustainable rates and all this unnecessary consumption produces pollution increasingly stressing the environment.

>Humanity is currently consuming the [equivalent of one and a half earths](http://footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/world_footprint/), according to the non-profit group Global Footprint Network. A separate report by WWF–World Wide Fund For Nature in collaboration with the Zoological Society of London and Global Footprint Network, calculates that the Middle East/Central Asia, Asia-Pacific, North America and European Union regions are each [consuming about double](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/images/uploads/LPR_2012.pdf) their regional biocapacity… – [Link](https://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/2015/03/18/unemployment-double-official-rate/)

Nearly all the population is ecologically illiterate, and this includes well-educated doctors, technical and engineering experts, public officials, teachers, etc. The environment is invisible to most of these people because they are blinded by bias and ignorance, inundated by mass media feel-good consumerist propaganda, or simply too tired from the drudgery of their work to give a fuck. I can no longer pretend that the human species has anything but an increasingly dysfunctional, dangerous, and dark future. Look at how the Middle East is unraveling right now. That area can’t be cleaned up or made even halfway normal again because they are suffering systemic collapse from climate change, overpopulation, resource wars, and overreach of American empire.

No, the situation cannot be reversed any time soon because the global economy is already committed to many more decades of fossil fuel burnings as so many have already pointed out. For Example:

>“Greenhouse gas emissions are expected to continue to rise—nobody thinks we have reached maximum emissions and things will soon be turning around,” Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif., said…

>…“Substantial reductions in emissions are possible for both the U.S. and the rest of the world, but it will take herculean efforts and transforming the global energy system into one that does not use the sky as a waste dump,” Caldeira said. “Tiny, but positive policy moves, like increasing automobile efficiency, certainly help, but if we are to get serious about avoiding the risk of dangerous climate change, we need to up our game by somewhere between a factor of 10 and 100 over what we are doing now.” – [Link](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-does-flat-co2-pollution-mean/)

and…

>…Since 2000, global carbon intensity has dropped by about 1% per year. But if we want to avoid more than 2°C of global warming, global carbon intensity has to drop by about 6% per year… – [Link](http://www.vox.com/2015/3/16/8224915/economic-growth-carbon-emissions)

Of course the oft-repeated 2°C global warming limit is, as we know, an arbitrary number concocted by politicians and business leaders for their convenience and not based on any sort of evidence that such a limit would actually protect us from ruin. Indeed, the 0.85°C that we have already experienced has set into motion catastrophic ice sheet melt at the poles and disrupted the earth’s hydrologic cycle, Jet Streams, and weather patterns. Sea level rise is accelerating exponentially and could reach 7 meters by 2070, according to the [calculations of physicist and climatologist Paul Beckwith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N330egsJD8A). Florida, one of the most vulnerable states to SLR, forbids its government officials to even utter the words climate change or sea level rise and then forces them to undergo a psychiatric evaluation if they do. These sort of antics that we keep reading about in the news certainly don’t inspire confidence that this species has a long and prosperous future before it. Hell, even supposedly “biodegradable plastic” really is [not biodegradable](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/msu-atb032015.php). Humans have created a bubble civilization which has completely detached its inhabitants from reality and the fact that their economy is entirely a subsidiary of the natural world, not vise versa. Rather than accepting this, what are we doing? Building sea walls and desalination plants, establishing new shipping routes and exploiting resources in the thawing Arctic, and studying ways to geoengineer the weather. This is how this civilization defines progress and anyone who gets in the way is a terrorist of some sort. Many things could have been done decades ago and they never were. Each day that goes by is simply another nail in our already sealed coffin.

We haven’t changed for decades except to increase global consumption of all resources and expel [ever-larger amounts of waste](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/10/30/global-waste-on-pace-to-triple) -GHGs, trash, plastic, and chemical pollution. Africa and South America are working on destroying the last two large rainforests in the world. Capitalism has spread like a cancer across the globe and the peasants are moving to the megacities in developing countries. Growth, growth, growth. All while the natural world continues to dwindle with [mass die-offs happening at an ever-increasing rate over the last century](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150113-mass-die-off-disease-animals-environment-science/). If we are changing, I think it’s more like a tumor metastasizing and engulfing its host. This isn't ""self-loathing"", this is an objective view of humanity from someone who cares about the continued existence of his own species and the well-being of all life on earth.","2015-03-28 14:52:18","61","50","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/30lpjq/an_increasingly_dysfunctional_dangerous_and_dark/","True","xrm67","1747823703.8340402","carbon footprint","manual"
