You're basically talking about building a commune from scratch. It will take a large investment of capital that has to come from somewhere. Unless you can convince a traditional developer to build it in place of a large suburb project, but then they would be selling the housing units back to people at a price equal to or higher than what they would get putting traditional suburban cookie cutter houses on the land.","2019-10-10 19:02:19","19","DorkHonor","1747925370.938595","carbon footprint","manual"

"f3a4ky8","t3_dg2irl","dg2irl","collapse","skeptical","Cities are physically located where they are for particular reasons which are too numerous to enumerate.  Equally, there are not cities in many places for specific reasons, and if it really was a good place for a city, well there would be one there already.  The long term success or failure of a dense population center is closely linked to where it is located and why.  Without making that linkage, a city from scratch is unlikely to succeed.","2019-10-11 02:39:26","4","greenman5252","1747925370.945384","carbon footprint","manual"

"f395k3f","t3_dg2irl","dg2irl","collapse","skeptical","Well the short answer is....it's too expensive: transportation infrastructure is but a small part of what keeps a city functioning. You also need to provide electricity, clean water, sewage treatment, flood control, emergency services, etc. To set those up from scratch and pay for it would require a massive investment and unprecedented cooperation between the landowner, construction contractor, the county, state, and federal government. It is orders of magnitude easier to implement changes piecemeal in existing cities (like converting 2 lanes of a four lane road to bus lanes). 

Then there's the fact that with the way things work now, people need to live close to jobs. And they like the trappings of modern life. So for now, this is about as close as we can get:

"f3aocqt","t3_dg2irl","dg2irl","collapse","skeptical","The problem is that people might not want to move to these cities, because of the following points:

* Friends don't live there
* No companies are there to work for
* Housing is not necessarily cheaper
* it's far away from many important infrastructures, such as airports or ports. 

Most important locations are already cities, so you would have to tear that city away and then rebuilt it in it's place.","2019-10-11 08:39:56","1","gaunernick","1747925370.950619","carbon footprint","manual"

"f24c5fm","t3_dbvc9e","dbvc9e","collapse","skeptical","It's a tricky situation, but what's messed up is that much of the health problems associated with obesity are due to low quality food products being pushed out, mixed with a lack of education and will power. 

With that said, the ""fat free"" movement was the worst thing to happen to food in recent times because fat was replaced with sugar. 

Now in terms of the malnourished, as others have stated, war and infrastructure are the reasons - not a lack of production. That's not to say our current methods are sustainable - they aren't. However, in meantime, we are in a post scarcity civilization where it's cheaper to send food thousands of miles on a train to a distributor, than 20 miles in your uncle's pick up to a farmers market. 

And worse yet, it's a requirement, in today's world, for the purposeful destruction of food in order to maintain prices and supply.","2019-10-01 16:54:06","2","[deleted]","1747925378.616405","carbon footprint","manual"
