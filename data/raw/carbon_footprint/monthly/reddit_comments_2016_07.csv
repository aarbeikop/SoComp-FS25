That would be a contradiction of the humans biological imperative. All creatures are reward seekers, but only the humans live in the abstract and thus have no upper limit on dopamine hits. I live in a fat spoiled country and almost everyone in my family and all my friends are among the global 1% and most can't shut the fuck up about their desires for the next dopamine hit. Same for a great many other in Canada. It's an ever growing bucket list of gizmos, movies, cars, vacations, food trucks, etc. Never content. Chasing the dragon. If civilization was at it's very very best with the rule of law still in effect and leaders and many citizens with some integrity, then maybe the humans could have extended their run by a number of decades or maybe a century. As it is, the humans are fastly approaching one of their worst low points for leadership and decadence and all this technology has made it so very convenient to spread  propaganda and manipulate the sheeple  at a level never before seen or imagined. The mindless cheering at COP 21 is just the humans clinging to magical thinking in the face of an oncoming existential crisis. It's a group coping mechanism. Evolution programed the humans like this and history is littered with these childlike fantasies in moments of crisis. COP 21 celebrations were like watching a big tribe of well to do white folks doing a 21st century Ghost Dance. As if by cheering and simply claiming everything is awesome over and over makes it a reality. Stay tuned, there will be more ghost dancing and ever more retarded promises of techno fixes, ole time religion popping up, fanatical nationalism and who knows what else - the humans are infinitely creative in their story making.","2016-07-16 01:34:04","5","[deleted]","1747855748.897074","carbon footprint","manual"

Aside from a few oddball outliers (myself included) does anyone know anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely serious about climate chnage, the environment, limits to growth etc that they take it so seriously they do something about it in their daily lives ?  Do they 'be the change they want to see in the world' ?  As /u/endtimesranter points out as an example, his entire groúp of family, friends and peers is about how to consume and spend more.  Everyone I know is the same, a few may even profess to care about 'our impact' but their actions show otherwise, COP21 is exactly that.  From their point of view it was a genuine success and it was a success... like Pokemon Go is a 'success'.  It boosts GDP,  Parisian Tourism garnered a huge boost, hotels were full, thousands of people booked airline flights and on and on.

It's the same reason Zuckerberg is 'successful'.  Being able to better target advertising to sell people stuff by garnering a massive audience, he like Gates etc before him gets to talk to head of states etc.  Do you think [Ms Joan Pick](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/13/ethicalliving-carbonfootprints) gets to ?  It is that very essence of 'success' that will ensure the biosphere is so changed we may not survive as a species.  Until we fundamentally change, there is coming back and we need another few thousand years for that, waaaay to late.  We are 'living proof' of the Fermi Paradox.  

We have folk like James Hansen and Michael Mann etal who emit vast quantities of CO2e advising us how dangerous it is to emit CO2e, we have crusaders like Naomi Klein etal doing the same thing ... this dystopian disconnection from reality is endemic.  

COP21 was hugely successful... you just need to better understand what success means.  There was never any intention to cut emisisons, COP's aren't about that, you cannot run a civilisation like it is today without fossil fuels, you need to completely change the entire economic, business and political systems and that will not happen. So we have COP's as a substitute for action, that's the success ! 

>Business leaders recognise that the biggest risk to their business is energy transition. **The most popular concept of this transition involves a substitution of renewables for fossil fuels and development of elusive tail-pipe technologies like carbon-capture and storage. This concept is comforting and simple. But it is also profoundly wrong. There is no way to achieve an energy transition without completely reworking every aspect of our infrastructure, industry and economy to vastly reduce energy demand. Changing the global economy to nearly eliminate the use of fossil fuels is a “wicked problem” – a problem with no known solution**

>When asked whether it was feasible to leave all the remaining fossil fuels in the ground, Dr. Holdren noted that it is not, because the U.S. — and the world — still depend on fossil fuels for more than 80 percent of all the primary energy we use,
