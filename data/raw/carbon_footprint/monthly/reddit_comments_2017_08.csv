Key word there is short. 

Not that I disagree with your post - it is fundamentally correct, and we are all guilty (in varying degrees) of contributing to the ecological clusterfuck that will inevitably crumble human civilization.

That said, I'm not sure that advising individuals to move to a tropical forest and try to hack it as farmers is necessarily good advice.  

>blaming convenient scapegoats for a collective problem

There might be a bit of chicken/egg condition here. On the one hand, our collective desire for AC, cheap-ass meat, cars, and all the other shit you mentioned drives the mechanism of capitalism into action - wherein a company will attempt to provide said service/item because it will allow the company to accumulate profit. Sometimes this can be done without overtly exploiting other humans, animals, or the environment, but most of the time it is more profitable to squeeze your resources as hard as you can.

On the other side of the coin, however, those same companies are also, in some cases more than others, responsible for creating our desire for the products they sell. Think of things like cigarettes and soda - they're both awful for us, both addictive in their own ways, and both have been marketed extensively in order to be ingratiated into our collective culture. Go out to eat? The waitress will list you what kind of soda are available. Having coffee in the morning? Enjoy a cigarette to make it even better - everyone knows - coffee + cigarettes = delicious - even if you don't smoke you know of this pairing of chemicals that so many of us cannot begin the day without. There's lots of examples of this, but to avoid belaboring the point about advertising and the creation of desire, let's suffice to say that the effort to normalize the use of a product is a hallmark feature of modern capitalism/consumerism. 

So our desires feed a system that creates products that meet our desires, while this system simultaneously instilling in us the desires that its products are made to fulfill.  

What might be missing from this cycle of desire is an impartial judge of utility, or value. Is merely wanting something to exist all it should take to have something created, or should the larger cost to manufacture, promote, and distribute a product also be scrutinized, perhaps by someone who will not profit from the final judgement? 

I don't necessarily blame politicians, or corporations, or people of any generation for not trying to stand in the way of a system that in essence creates and fulfills human desires. What I find troubling is that there is no governance that can, at least in my humble opinion, effectively stand in the way of such a system. Is it not innately human to desire more than we have? I think that capitalism is, in essence, the free expression of that infinite well of desire that we all regularly tap into. 

I don't necessarily blame capitalism for our inevitable collapse - I attribute our slow, collective, industrialized suicide on the fundamental desires we all share as human beings.","2017-08-31 18:52:59","11","CatsFantastic","1747877510.369636","carbon footprint","manual"

What about a multi decade billion dollar a year denial campaign to lie and muddy the waters and create an army of useful idiot true believer deniers? Think it has had zero effect? Why do it if it does not work? Why own politicians? Hook line and sinker. You have bought into the well orchestrated propaganda myth. Who the fuck do you think came up with the guilt trip recycling? Corporations and think tanks and their bought and paid for enviro NGO's.

Big fucking difference between owning some responsibility and criminal guilt.

Perhaps if the populous had not been lied to by the biggest criminal conspiracy in history, they might have chosen differently? I guess we will never know since that choice was taken away by decades of lying to the public and corrupting politicians.

I suppose you believe corporation are people too?

It's fucking ludicrous that you are condemning everyone equally for the choices they made when many of their choices were made based on lies from a gaggle of psychopaths. 

Like the anti immigrant crowd who wants to dump everything on them when it is in fact the law makers who on behalf of their corporate masters who create the conditions for excessive amounts of illegal immigration, you lack the courage to go after those who own the lions share of the guilt. Much easier and safer that way which is why scapegoats are always peers or minorities and not the powerful who call the shots. Too fucking scared to take on the man.

That has to be the dumbest idea ever.  For almost all of us, it would be a painful and tedious way to commit suicide.  For probably a majority of Americans, they don't even have enough money to get there.

Who wouldn't pick ""living in an unstable world"" to dying?","2017-08-31 21:34:30","4","[deleted]","1747877510.379476","carbon footprint","manual"

The only hope of averting ecological catastrophe is if we can transform the world energy system and invest in carbon sequestration (approaches that are simple and that work such as organic farming to build up organic matter in the soil).

Collapse can be viewed as a population problem.     Modern society wouldn't be exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth if world population was much smaller.  The Earth could support America for a long time but it can't support all of humanity much longer when it is living the same way as Americans.  I sometimes blame Clinton for the climate crisis for his role in bootstrapping the industrialization of China.  

The most positive contribution you can make is by remaining engaged and working to transform society. Continuously educating yourself about the crisis and potential solutions is important.  Not having children or having a small family helps.  Certainly we should avoid wasteful energy use: driving inefficient cars, using air conditioning unnecessarily, failing to invest in the efficiency of our homes. 

I guess killing people on as large a scale as possible, especially those with the potential to reproduce, could also make a meaningful contribution to avoiding collapse, but I can't condone that.
