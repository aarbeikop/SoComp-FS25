If everyone lived like an American [we'd need about 4 earth's worth of space and resources](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712). Also, if resources were socialized so that everyone in the world was middle classed, the carbon footprint of the world would increase by 150% (citation needed, but the study exists). 

Paradoxically though, this is exactly why the overpopulation excuse is not good enough for first world citizens, because these people [consume exponentially more resources than africans](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/810). Of course poverty has its own set of environmental challenges, but it is safe to say the world is better off without 7 billion middle class, car driving, meat overeating, concrete house inhabiting people.","2017-05-01 00:04:55","6","[deleted]","1747873224.798839","carbon footprint","manual"

Yes, you're right, in the same way.

The only 'solution' is genuone sustainability ie each person gets to use 1/7.5 billionth of the resoirce that are available as renewable.  We've yet to even decide to countenance that as a solition because the inevitable outcome of that as a choice is unpalatable to the majority, let alone the 1%.

The question to ponder now is: How do these lives enrich existence? The European's standard of living allows him to make inventions, read classical literature, visit mountain tops or travel to the depths of the ocean""

Your first mistake was assuming that theres anything in life that is genuinly fufilling or meaningful or 'enriching'. What you see as enlightened activities are just further delusions and time killing activities. If life is not a horrible mess of sadism and survival, dog eat dog, its a mediocore, boring comedy with a shitty punchline. Whatever good there is, is either a coping mechanism for anxiety or boredom or pain or a mechanism to perpetuate more empty puppets into the grinder.

Life is dukkha, realize the european isnt all that better off from the starvinf african. A life of comfort, sure, and for what? A more comfortable ride to death, nothing more. All the while feasting on the victims of the worst holocaust in history (animal agriculture), lying on the backs of slaves, for the pleasure of being bored, anxious, empty, and unsatisfied.

Ironically its only in the depths of hell that those coping mechanisms really kick in. Hallucinations of god or loved ones, deep bonds formed on the edge of death, the rush of adrenaline and meaningful struggle and pain. Read up 'War is a force that gives us meaning' for this great irony.","2017-05-09 09:53:41","2","NihilBlue","1747873324.125052","carbon footprint","manual"
