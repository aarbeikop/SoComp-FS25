I'd say if you can start with something other than basketballs?  I like it but was a little confused on the measurement reasoning. Maybe a prompt in how the miles would be measured to allow folks to choose?","2019-06-03 21:03:27","1","CodfishCannon","1747919638.750703","carbon footprint","manual"
"epxvqwc","t3_bwewbi","bwewbi","environment","emotional","Interesting, as an avid skier myself I often think about the environmental impact. It seems easier to green your skiing if you live in Europe; living in the Eastern US where the majority of the population is, it is almost mandatory to fly to ski anywhere near the same level as the Alps.  The increased level of flying produced by skiing make organizations like Protect Our Winters almost comical, but I do appreciate their efforts.","2019-06-04 01:35:41","1","EclecticEuTECHtic","1747919729.233964","carbon footprint","manual"

2. Plenty of vegan products are terrible for the environment. Someone else already mentioned the problems with almonds, but consider that leather alternatives are usually made from plastics, plenty of vegetables are grown in harmful ways (pesticides, etc.), and so on.

3. Saying things like ""Your not a *real* environmentalist if..."" doesn't do much to convince people to become vegan. You just come off sounding like a gatekeeper.","2019-06-21 14:49:43","21","[deleted]","1747920337.0779982","carbon footprint","manual"
"err2apl","t3_c3as38","c3as38","sustainability","action-oriented","One point concerning veganism is that you have to consider the ecology of pure plant farming vs mixed livestock and plant systems. There are many advantages, from an agroecological standpoint, to mixed systems.

&#x200B;

So from this standpoint, having some livestock production can be more beneficial.

&#x200B;

As far as the emissions aspect -- newer research suggests that even with beef -- the worst offender -- emissions can be offset by carbon sequestration with the right grazing systems.

"ers89bx","t3_c3as38","c3as38","sustainability","action-oriented","We as a species tend to have very absolute and myopic views about things and leap before thinking, whether it’s really horrible shit (DDT) or alternating recommendations like a certain food is bad for you/no wait it’s actually good (e.g. wine and eggs). It’s one thing to say dairy production for butter has a high load on our environment, it’s another to go buy margarine made with palm oil. (There is no such thing as sustainable or responsible palm oil.)

So consider the idea of [permaculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture). It hinges in having as complete an understanding as possible of what processes exist and you are participating or interfering with. You can integrate livestock into these systems, as the animals we eat/take stuff from have been part of the ecosystem in general for a very long time. Meat didn’t appear in the last two hundred years. 

You should also consider your own situation and what choices you’re in a position to make. Farmer next door to me sends cattle from pasture to slaughter. The impact is vastly different from those animals spending their lives in feed lots and travelling huge distances. On the other hand there are a lot of specialty plant products that ride the Heavy Fuel Oil ship across the Pacific. Of course there are examples in each category of the opposite; I’m trying to point out that things are not black-and-white.","2019-06-22 12:01:31","6","holysirsalad","1747920337.083501","carbon footprint","manual"

There are plenty of valid critiques of veganism (an over-dependence on synthetic fibers being one of them) but most important part is that it’s important to do your best. 

Also, yes the animal-industry is taking a huge environmental toll, but where do you source your food? (Actually, you should ask this of all the food you eat. Hell, even the stuff you buy you should ask yourself ‘where did this come from and how did it get made?’) Buying from small farmers -including eggs and meat- would get you a platinum star as an environmentalist.","2019-06-21 20:22:48","1","Sturnella2017","1747920337.093316","carbon footprint","manual"

But seriously, environmentalism is a mindset. It's about being conscious of your relationship and humanity's relationship with the planet's biosphere. It's about being good stewards of the garden, the home we call Earth.

Veganism is a lifestyle that has a positive correlation with the environmentalist mindset. But the two are not the same; nor does one require the other.","2019-06-23 07:43:14","2","silentstorm128","1747920337.0963259","carbon footprint","manual"
"erqqyqm","t3_c3as38","c3as38","sustainability","action-oriented","I would argue that is not what you eat, but how it was produced. 

If you eat vegan from monocultures I would argue you are not an environmentalist, it degrades the soil anyways and kills biodiversity.

In my opinion what we need are fully functional ecosystems and for this plants, fungi and  animals (all types) are needed. Any production that is degrading the soil or killing biodiversity is not sustainable at the end.
