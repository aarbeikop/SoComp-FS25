"5tjsb8","collapse","skeptical","Is it true that Europe no longer has any natural resources worth fighting over? - Europe would not be the best continent to escape collapse","I don't know who said it. I think it was Dmitri Orlov, who knows more about Russia than most people interested in Collapse, but I could be wrong.

Anyways, I did hear that Europe has no longer any resources worth fighting over, and the last major resource of Europe is the coalfields in Donbass, now controlled by two puppet republics who answer to Putin.

During the Great War , and even in the 2nd world war, Europe still had considerable resources to fight over. 

But now it seems all Europe has are old buildings and lots of 'refugees'. 

Even before the beginning of the Great war Britain was importing most of its food, which was why the submarine war was so important (and the idiot Prime Minister of Germany, Bethman-Hollweg, threw away the best chance to win the war by ending the submarine war for a while).

Now, all of Europe need lots of imports to feed its people.

It seems that in a breakdown of international trade, Europe would be as f'ked as Africa and some overpopulated Asian coutries, and even more so since Europe's carbon footprint is considerably larger.","2017-02-12 05:09:25","1","7","0.53","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5tjsb8/is_it_true_that_europe_no_longer_has_any_natural/","True","kulmthestatusquo","1747868374.361299","carbon footprint","manual"
