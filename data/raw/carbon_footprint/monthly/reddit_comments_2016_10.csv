But you can't spend away debt.  Nothing to do but make money and then pay off that debt.","2016-10-06 18:24:12","5","Jesuselvis","1747861692.466718","carbon footprint","manual"

A fucking machine extraordinaire, decided by secret ballot. So, if less clever people were in charge we would be what? Already extinct? Luckily we still have a handful of decades until the human caused 6th mass extinction claims us too. Golly gee are our masters ever clever.","2016-10-06 23:50:59","2","[deleted]","1747861692.477176","carbon footprint","manual"

"d8hpr7b","t3_566jef","566jef","collapse","skeptical","No guarantee that those most suited to this society's rules are the most able to adapt to change, and Darwin's definition of 'fittest' (as in 'survival of') is those most fit to adapt to evolutionary change, not 'the currently most successful', as it seems to have been redefined by... well, the currently most successful!

I think the turkey's faith in the future was strongest right on Christmas Eve morning (Thanksgiving day eve for our American turkey cousins), another great night's sleep in the coup, fed and watered looking forward to another great day of turkey luxury! Why not? It had all worked out perfectly so far. Confidence must have been high.

By the way, talk of what would have to be a high percentage of the richest 1,000,000 all flying off to Mars together is hilarious***. Assuming Musk gets one of these rockets off the ground (and his current pricing claim is about a third less than a boeing 777 jet isn't it, which is clearly suspect given it's half way across the solar system and all that?) Lets hope he makes sure to beam back footage because it will be the funniest reality shit-show ever.
