"e0tb65z","t3_8rpnj3","8rpnj3","collapse","skeptical","Interesting thesis, but for a non-American it seems quite absurd.

* It tries to shoehorn issues from contemporary American politics into a long-standing global debate. I understand the minutia of immigration between low/high footprint cultures (though even the link you posted says *""The estimated CO2 emissions of the average immigrant (legal or illegal) in the United States are 18 percent less than those of the average native-born American.""*). However, it 
 is used here to completely detract from any real criticism - the extraordinarily high footprint of US consumer culture (and other cultures, for that matter). Same goes for coal (where it's even more ridiculous as coal was pushed aside more by market forces than by activism...)

* Painting climate activists at large (it didn't seem like you were limiting yourself to politicians, of which very few deserve that label) as white, rich, disconnected, elitist hypocrites who don't 'practice what they preach' leads to a contentious straw-man argument. Again, maybe in the US the divide is really as clear as the author would have me believe, but foreigner me sees this depiction as a bit cynical.

* Most egregiously, the thesis assumes that the last generations of climate-change deniers (from both ends of the political spectrum) were arguing in good faith, and that if not personally alienated (by climate activist 'elitists') these people would otherwise engage with the scientific evidence. 

All-in-all, it seems like your argument makes the same mistake you outlined in the beginning by letting it devolve to partisan American politics. There are so many reasons why climate change was never addressed, and I feel like ""progressives in the US"" isn't at the very top of that list.","2018-06-17 10:40:17","20","MaximinusDrax","1747891264.65696","carbon footprint","manual"

Oh yeah, you just see tons of progressive politicians in our government who wield all kinds of power...What the fuck?

This is nonsense. ","2018-06-17 23:10:14","5","[deleted]","1747891264.6617758","carbon footprint","manual"
"e0teltd","t3_8rpnj3","8rpnj3","collapse","skeptical","> Climate change and environmentalism have been assimilated into a broader progressive agenda, that effectively exclude people outside of the traditional progressive demographic.

[Paul Kingsnorth](http://paulkingsnorth.net) wrote about this in “Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist”. It’s worth checking out. Many of the essays in the book can be found online.

> But how many progressives are able to spare some of the rage they have towards Donald Trump, for Justin Trudeau? 

FWIW, Bill McKibben came out against Trudeau’s decision, but I didn’t see any reaction in the mainstream (liberal?) press.
