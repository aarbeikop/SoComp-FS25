Yes. A great deal of heat is wasted in the production of electricity: [https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/charts/Energy/Energy\_2018\_United-States.png](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/charts/Energy/Energy_2018_United-States.png)

Global Scale:

Individual Scale:

In all honesty, if the situation gets as bad as you think it will, sports will simply turn from a private venture into a state-run venture. National sports teams already exist, and militaries are known to have their own sports teams, plus keeping sports going has a morale boosting effect in hard times, it keeps a sense of normalcy alive even as the world is burning all around.
