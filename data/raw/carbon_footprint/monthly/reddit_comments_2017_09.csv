Perhaps I liked it because he had a go at the denialists like McKibbon, Gore etal ? and their ""same as it ever was, we just need moah solar panels and wind turbines ideology"". While they are needed, we also need to recognise that ""success"" depends on transitioning the entire polotical and economic system we live under into a very low energy future, the wind turbines are the easy part.  

That said, I understand them wanting to do something and we all understand what happens when people are genuinely truthful about the size of the task in front of us, people switch off and go back to dog and cat memes.

Here's another energy expert, [Professor Susan Krumdieck](http://low-emission-future.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/can-engineers-change-world-energy.html)

>Business leaders recognise that the biggest risk to their business is energy transition. **The most popular concept of this transition involves a substitution of renewables for fossil fuels and development of elusive tail-pipe technologies like carbon-capture and storage. This concept is comforting and simple. But it is also profoundly wrong**. There is no way to achieve an energy transition without completely reworking every aspect of our infrastructure, industry and economy to vastly reduce energy demand. Changing the global economy to nearly eliminate the use of fossil fuels is a “wicked problem” – a problem with no known solution.

Electric car dream collides with reality on profits (FT)

https://www.ft.com/content/cfa0544c-9962-11e7-b83c-9588e51488a0

The average person causes 1.5 gigabytes of data per day. By 2020 your car will cause 4.5 terrabytes per day.

FT QUOTE: A self-driving car of the future will be equipped with at least 20 sensors using cameras, radar and lidar to ‘see’ its surroundings. Some of the data must be transmitted to the cloud so the car can communicate with its surroundings, but programming the software to only send the relevant data is a central challenge. (Enter 5G)

A person watching Netflix in HD at home would consume three gigabytes of data per hour; Mr Degenhart says a self-driving car collects raw data volume of up to 15 gigabytes per second. “We need a different kind of electronic architecture in the vehicle to handle these volumes,” he says.

The energy just required to power these self-driving systems is so great that a prototype electric car with a 400km range can only drive 200km autonomously, notes Scott Gallett, vice-president of marketing for BorgWarner, a maker of propulsion systems. “One of the things people don’t talk about is just how much energy is really required by the computers, the sensors, the radars,” he says. “Some of the prototypes out right now require just as much as energy to drive autonomously as it does to propel the vehicle.”","2017-09-16 20:32:01","5","b_l_a","1747878765.934486","carbon footprint","manual"

One thing that I haven't seen here is the effect of supply and demand relating to profit driven corporations in the electronics industries marketing products that run on energy. It's the 'bigger the bucket, the more holes' example that was given from Ozzie Zehner. Companies have been very successful in marketing their products using emotional reasoning, propaganda, etc in their advertisements. I think that if we had a surplus of energy, companies/corporations would meet that surplus at different levels. I also believe that people would develop a group think compared to that of 1950's (limitless expansion), as new generations seem to forget history. 

We also still have yet to see the effect of the Common Core standards/education which just was implemented in 2009 and David Coleman went on to revise College exams in the same Common Core fashion.

No, they don't. If you are 'subsistence living', then you have **no income to secure title** to the patch of forest you inhabit. Therefore you are subject to eviction, arrest, seizure of goods and other harassment. Not to mention the plethora of local regulations on building construction, occupancy, zoning, etc. You are very much compelled to live in a narrow range of possibilities.
