You may want to actually do some reading. That is plainly impossible.

From google, ""At the Earth's surface, the energy **density** is reduced to approximately 1,000 W/m2 for a surface perpendicular to the Sun's rays at sea level on a clear day"". A typical sedan is roughly 6 ft wide and 15 ft long ... so 90 sq ft = 8.36 sq meter. 

Hence, even if you put 100% efficiency solar cell on a car, it can generate roughly 836 W = 1.12 horsepower.

From google, "" A typical **car** in America **has** something around a 120-**horsepower** engine. A big SUV might **have** a 200-**horsepower** engine, and a tiny **car** might **have** only 70 **horsepower**. A moped, on the other hand **has** only a 1- or 2- **horsepower** engine, and it gets great gas mileage -- 70 or 80 miles per gallon.""

It is not even close. It is less than 1% of the power in a typical car. 

Sure, electric car which you CHARGE help the environment. But solar power on a car is so weak that it is not worth the effort to consider.","2019-11-25 14:10:16","3","[deleted]","1747926154.585401","carbon footprint","manual"

"f8ovi3d","t3_e1f461","e1f461","climatechange","action-oriented","> **What do we need to change to stop climate change?** 

Everything. Like, your suggestions are a good start but they're basically useless without larger societal change.

The problem with climate change *isn't* that we don't know what needs to be done but rather that everyone in a position to actually do something either doesn't care or would prefer keeping the political, economical, and social systems that keep them in power over meaningful action.

We need to rapidly shift towards a society that does all the things you mention **and a whole lot more** and that does so in a way that doesn't make the world worse for the most vulnerable communities. 

Like I said, the things you suggest are things I'd consider the bare minimum and they'd need to exist in a much wider societal approach.

> I would say, starting immediately, recycling is mandatory, and we need classes and videos showing us and teaching us what can and cannot be recycled, and how to prep things we will recycle.

Classes and videos are a good start but people also need the time and energy to learn these skills and go to these classes and that'd mean reducing the amount of hours it means to work full-time **and** ensure that you can actually survive on the wage that gives. 

It also means ensuring people have spaces for these classes and things like repair cafés and a reliable way to access them. This means having infrastructure that allows **everyone** to easily access public transportation and having enough space to safely cycle to these places. It also means building and staffing these places.

Additionally, this also means trying to have more local production that's controlled by the community *and* either banning or heavily restricting products that rely on things like planned obsolescence or make it harder to repair your own devices (looking at you, Apple).

> Discontinue use of fossil fuels, there are clean energy fuel alternatives in the works, and soon there will be solar powered cars that charge themselves while you drive: imagine never having to get gas again? I'm waiting for flying cars, but I don't have information on them. 

Cutting out fossil fuels will be necessary but we should also change how we think about generating and consuming power. So-called green energy often relies on battery technology that's incredibly harmful to the environment and requires materials that pollute the earth and are associated with severe human rights abuses. Apart from looking for different ways to generate power we also need to find ways to consume significantly less power.

This means that flying cars aren't happening and also that personal cars in general should be **heavily** reduced. Again, this means ensuring infrastructure that allows for better access to public transport and non-car travel *and* building our communities in such a way that we simply don't need cars to begin with. 

> P,lastics have to go, we're already bringing our own bags to grocery stores, we have so many products stored in plastic, it's hard to imagine living without it, but it's come to a point, if we want to live, we have to live without it. There are other materials like glass or ceramic, even cardboard, that would suffice. 

Apart from different packing materials, more localized production could also be a factor. You don't need to pack vegetables in plastic if you can just get them out of your local community-managed garden.

You don't need to make them trendy, you need to make them a necessity for staying in power. Do you think politicians and CEOs don't know what needs to be done or that they think it's just not cool enough to do these things?

"f8pn6ar","t3_e1f461","e1f461","climatechange","action-oriented","If we switch to Bamboo-based products we could reverse the climate crisis: (20% Net Carbon Removal and 90-99% GHG reduction)

Compared to trees, bamboo (actually a grass!) is a better Carbon investment, due to it's rapid growth and harvest potential, and can replace our commercial fiber needs.

Actually, scientists say ""We urge the adoption of timber bamboo as a new global source of structural fiber and the only realistic near term CDR strategy we have on hand."" (Hinkle, et al., 2019 Carbon Farming with Timber Bamboo: A Superior Sequestration System Compared to Wood)

So why aren't we doing this already?

AWARENESS. ""Bamboo simply has less research, fewer publications and diminished resources focused on its opportunistic exploitation compared to wood."" (Hinkle, et al.)

But did you know Bamboo can be turned into Ethanol and used as a BioFuel! In fact, ""Bioethanol from bamboo is shown to be both technically and economically feasible, as well as competitive with petrol in China."" (Littlewood, et al., 2013 Techno-economic potential of bioethanol from bamboo in China)

*(Also, it's the lowest GHG emitting biofuel out of all the biofuels....)*

Pretty cool right?

It gets better!

We can do both!

1. We can send the Bamboo Timber to a Bio-Refinery where Ethanol and Paper (Carbon-storing products) are produced.

2. After the Paper or various Carbon-storing products are used and recycled, they are returned to the Bio-Refinery to be turned into Biochar (Another Carbon-storing product).

3. The process of making Biochar (Pyrolysis) also leaves us with Bio-Oil and Syn-Gas. All 3 are Fossil Fuel replacements! Giving us the ability to switch to cleaner energy.

4. Biochar is then sent to the Bamboo Farmers to put back into their farms as a soil amendment. Increasing future yields, increasing soil fertility, and storing Carbon back into the soil reducing our Carbon Dioxide abundance in the atmosphere which is over 400 ppm (That's bad).

5. Bamboo shoots are picked for food every year during pruning/upkeep of the farm. Any agricultural waste is sent to the Bio-Refinery to be converted to biochar and energy. The biochar is then returned to the farmers and put back into the soil.

This is a Carbon Negative Cycle with Bamboo Farming.

Could you help me bring more attention to this?

The mileage required in carbon offset will vary based on country and standard of living... And if course what is actually being done for offset.

But the claim you can offset your carbon footprint with $2 is inaccurate for people living in the developed world by many orders of magnitude. More accurate to say this is your base unit to begin carbon offset.

For the average US citizen... I have no idea how much that would cost but it would be many thousands of dollars every year.

Maybe if you built a tool to calculate people's approximate carbon footprint you could figure out how much purchase is needed for that person. That would be interesting but also daunting when you do the math. It would get very expensive... Inputs would include; vehicle make and average mileage, electric bill and power source, grocery items and distance traveled to store, purchase of personal items and footprint....

To do so accurately would require a huge amount of accounting so maybe installing some average figures for the little things would be most realistic.","2019-11-23 20:40:24","1","[deleted]","1747926216.691663","carbon footprint","manual"

"f8bug0q","t3_e042kt","e042kt","climatechange","action-oriented","OP, the list posted is a great start. To your specific examples...

The climate change debate isn't just about temperatures and carbon footprints. In fact, most people have a really hard time dealing with that threat mentally, because it is largely invisible to us and the outcomes difficult to accurately predict.

Regarding plastic straws, the idea there is simply that it is a disposable plastic. Bags, wrappers, cheap toys, even the fibers in your fleece jacket...all contribute extremely negatively to the environment. It is literally poisoning all life on earth. You can't buy sea salt that is free of plastic anymore. It is a part of your body at this point, and the long term effects are still unknown.

Habitat destruction and the resulting wildlife die-off, if you didn't know already, are near cataclysmic. We've lost over half of all wildlife on earth in the last 50 years. In just the oceans, that number is more like 80%. And almost all of that is the product of habitat destruction caused by...humans.

Carbon footprints and habitat destruction are very closely linked. From poisoning an ecosystem with chemical runoff to clear-cutting a forest to sell logs or create a farm, the end result is clear. More carbon in the atmosphere, less chance for animal life to thrive, less healthy vegetation to sustain it all.

If you're looking for what to focus on because you can't do it all, look at your consumption, especially of single use items. The three Rs are a hierarchy. First, reduce. If you can't do that, reuse. If you can't do that, recycle.","2019-11-22 17:59:43","2","[deleted]","1747926222.349013","carbon footprint","manual"

There is simply no way to predict what might happen on a scale that could affect this person. Really awful things happen around the world every day. They're generally increasing in frequency. When something will happen where any given person is on any given day is a craps shoot.

Something untoward is probably much more likely to happen in that span of time there, than here, wherever here is for you, and them. How great that risk is, is unknowable, and up for debate.
