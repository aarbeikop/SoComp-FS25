Apparently, the energy required to send an email is the equivalent of 4g of CO2. The numbers for spam mails and mail with lengthy attachment are 0.3g CO2e and 50g CO2e respectively.

Go to your mail box, unsubscribe from all of those newsletters that you've and will never touch. Governments and corporations are not doing enough to combat climate crisis, we have to do anything we can to slow it down.","2019-05-29 03:34:52","5","28","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bu9qss/unsubscribe_those_newsletters_you_never_read_to/","True","ArciusRhetus","1747912994.470952","carbon footprint","manual"

I’ve started to care more about the environment, and I thought that I should try my best to live a more sustainable lifestyle. Do you know of any resources I could use to learn about what I should do? Any help is appreciated :)","2019-05-11 14:59:12","67","31","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bncy8j/looking_to_live_more_sustainably_where_do_i_start/","True","me_at4am","1747919132.627684","carbon footprint","manual"
"bmo4o2","sustainability","action-oriented","Raising a bit of awareness :)","From my perspective and what I know( I study Enviromental Engineering at univesity) the biggest *INDIRECT* pollution comes from buildings being inadequatly insulated and engineered.

The fact is we get heat from burning fossil fuels and even renewable sources have a ""carbon footprint"", so if you are truly aware of the problems, you should know that around 30% of energy we generate is being used on heating and cooling our living spaces, and that leaves a hefty carbon footprint.

Pic is from college presentation we study from, subject is called Energy management.

Edit: 

Some sources say that buildings consume around 40% of the total energy produced in the world, ""around 30%"" may just have been for Croatia or the EU . One source is [https://www.iea.org/topics/energyefficiency/buildings/](https://www.iea.org/topics/energyefficiency/buildings/)  , which also states that buildings are responsible for 40% of the emissions of CO2

Also, apologies for my un-scientific expression, it is not ""*INDIRECT pollution""* but rather just emission, because I did not talk about waste in this post.

BTW, first post :D
