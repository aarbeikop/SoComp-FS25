"dbkvek","climate","scientific","Open Letter / Suggestions To Introduce More Greenery and Reduce Carbon Footprint Worldwide","Hello. I'm writing this in response to growing concern regarding climate change and our society's consumption.

I suggest that as a means of reducing human footprint, and restoring livelihood to the Earth (including oxygen-generating plants, trees, animals, insects, and other non-human aspects of the natural biome), city planners seek to consolidate local businesses into specific parking lots, while moving all vacant lot spaces to dedicated lots, and deconstructing these consolidated VACANT lots in order to plant trees, plants, and reintroduce animal life to the environment.

I propose that those in charge of shaping and expanding cities nationwide be given limitations in regards to concrete coverage on the ground, removal of greenery, and in fact, make clear efforts to shape communities in favor of natural flora and small animal integration to society. 

Furthermore, I propose that the possibility of reshaping community layouts be investigated. Fuel and carbon exhaust can be reduced by reducing the distance needed to be traveled for people to work, and attain things necessary for livelihood,  aside from material luxury. That means food, water, and interaction with other humans as well as nature. 

I propose, in addition to consolidating vacant lots and deconstructing them to plant trees, that the freed land be also used to plant local agriculture, around which communities can be shaped. This would provide jobs to people supporting their local agriculture, also reducing the costs of importing produce, making food more attainable, and cutting down the exhaust otherwise needed to ship, by ground or air, produce cross-country, or further.

This would also make way to explore options for consolidating humans' living conditions. More eco-friendly domestic buildings can be built, allowing humans to live in closer habitation, needing to travel less for produce, exercise, and medical care, among other necessities.

I suggest these actions in the interest of reclaiming much of the needlessly concrete-covered Earth for green, oxygen-generating plants and natural life forms. We cannot endlessly consume the life of this planet and call it ""human growth"" or ""economic growth"".

Steps need to be taken to respect the fact that this Earth is not ours to kill. It will not be recreated. Time will not be able to be reversed. And no development of technology will be able to re-freeze the ice caps, should they continue to deteriorate. 

If these issues are to continue to be ignored, we may not be able to live out the duration of 4 or 5 more presidential elections. And no amount of ""new revolutionary products"" will be able to distract the 7.5 billion people on Earth that the planet and its people, animals, and everything that makes life worth living, is about to be no more.","2019-10-01 00:12:41","1","0","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/dbkvek/open_letter_suggestions_to_introduce_more/","True","jcriddick137","1747924979.4489758","carbon footprint","manual"
"dg2irl","collapse","skeptical","Why aren't we building more cities from scratch?","So everyone keeps talking about this transformative change that we need to do in society, but trying to accomplish that while keeping everything mostly the same and just adding new technological gizmos like electric cars and solar panels seems like the height of folly to me. It's clear we need to actually have change that goes to a deeper level if we want to actually have a chance of reducing our carbon footprint to where it needs to be. Instead of trying to transform existing cities which are built around cars and other inefficiencies, it seems much easier to just start from scratch and build a city based around different infrastructure. 

You could have most roads only be for bikes, and small electric vehicles like scooters and stuff and then do other roads which are all public transportation. Building 100 electric buses is going to be way better for the environment than building 1000 electric cars. Get a source of renewable energy for the entire city first and everything can be green. We could integrate the agricultural production of the city into the city design itself to remove the risk of food disruption and reduce the amount of transportation for food. Instead of doing heat and air conditioning, we could just build two cities in the north and south for summer and winter and have people migrate. You could keep everything that is normally sold in single-use plastic be sold in washable jars that are then collected and washed and redistributed to businesses. We could do a lot of things if we started from scratch with a community of people who all self select and agree to join on to the project and give it a go.  I think there are many people who want to start living in an eco-friendly way, but they don't know how because they can't afford a farm or something off by themselves. 

If we're ever going to figure out what we're actually going to transform into, it's going to take a lot of experimentation. I think this could be an opportunity to experiment with different social, economic, and even political structures. A lot of these would be necessary for reducing the carbon footprint. Like for example you could mandate that all appliances are standardized and designed to be easily and indefinitely repaired so that they are easily maintained long-term and have the government provide them to people. You could implement a ""labor tax"" where people are required to do a certain amount of labor for the government, or else pay an alternate fee to get out of it. Using this pool of labor you could provide things like housing, maintenance, education, food, water, electricity, internet, renewable commodities, etc. to the people in the community while still allowing them enough free time to pursue business or pleasure. There are many different possibilities to tweak things, we should be out there beta testing all of it in new cities with special rules and special infrastructure. 

If you try to get any existing group of people to all agree to new rules, you will end up with many unhappy people who hate change. If you start new though, you just get enthusiastic people who are excited to try something new. So why aren't there hundreds, if not thousands of proposals for new eco-cities in the works at this point? If construction were kept simple like with habitat for humanity, all the people who are looking for something to do can get busy building.","2019-10-10 18:48:48","24","18","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dg2irl/why_arent_we_building_more_cities_from_scratch/","True","Cannavor","1747925369.686056","carbon footprint","manual"
"dbvc9e","collapse","skeptical","What if we rebalance the human populations in line with food production?","There are about 2 billion malnourished people on the planet along with about 2 billion obese people...

So it sounds like we have a food distribution problem, right?

What if we view this as a population distribution problem...

If we move people to where the food is and away from where the food is not sustainable.  For instance some countries like the UK and Japan can only locally feed about half or less of their current population.  A one time movement of people could massively reduce the carbon footprint of food transportation globally.

Ideally this migration based strategy would also relocate people to be as close as possible to their food sources without disrupting their production, thereby minimising transportation costs and carbon footprint.

I realise this is just an interesting hypothetical as currently we have rising global tensions and nationalism and this idea would be viewed as evil invasive globalism\*.

But it would be interesting to work out how much we could potentially reduce our global carbon footprint by moving the people to the food once as opposed to constantly moving the food to the people.

Also it's a lot nicer than the potential future where oil, transportation or harvests are disrupted and countries that cannot sustain their population without imports enter a apocalyptic level of collapse and civil unrest.

>In 1906, Alfred Henry Lewis stated, “There are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy.”

\*Just realised that Nationalist could adopt a generational policy to export people not born here or both parents/grandparent not born here to reduce their country to sustainable food levels.  The idea here is could we migrate the global population scientifically to minimise global food transportation.","2019-10-01 15:51:51","0","16","0.44","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dbvc9e/what_if_we_rebalance_the_human_populations_in/","True","Arowx","1747925377.547976","carbon footprint","manual"
"ddmzt0","collapse","skeptical","I'm fed up with Greta worshipping and revolt posts everyday.","Take one day off and you get a memo. Take part in anything 'illegal' and you will be fired to protect reputation. Have 1 Arrest record and you can't get a govt job anymore. I had already gotten a warning to get detained from my institution when teacher heard me talking about clatherate gun event (last year)

Hey listen, I too want to be like Greta but the difference is that while she got all the money, media and big people rolling around her due to being from a rich family with good connections HERE I AM trying to arrange money for my next meal. Give me about 10mil so that I won't have to worry about basic survival of me and my family and I'll go and personally stab those rich oil lobbyists.

I go along with the wheel I'll collapse next decade. I try to play Greta and I'll collapse tomorrow.

Also collapse is getting mainstream because it has started making money now not because of some 16 year old girl. It is getting stronger because now owners of green tech like solar, nuclear are also lobbying against oil giants. Corporates are shifting towards renewables because oil is drying up. Its now businessmen vs businessmen.

Heck we have known about environmental crisis from 1950s. Thousands of scientists and activists were warning us since then and many have been 'Episteined' over it. I find mindlessly echoing 'A brave teen who alone shook the world in a matter of days and everyone should be like her' insulting to those who actually did work in this field and sacrificed their life for it.

I do what I can

I don't have a fuel based vehicle. I own a manual cycle and I use public transport for long distances

I have stopped single used plastics now. Why now shills will ask, because only now shopkeepers have stopped giving things in them. I never bought one plastic bag. I was just using what came with shopping.

I don't have an ac. I have a desert cooler.

I have a veg garden

I have solar

I'm getting skills

I'm telling people I know about upcoming collapse. But not by crying out loud , by having a proper discussion with them. Yes they argue at first but when shown facts, graphs, bunkers rich people are making, sea ice conditions etc I can proudly say that I've turned 3 out of 13-15 people I've talked to into reducing their carbon footprint. They still use car for office commute but not anymore for shopping, nightouts etc. They don't waste potable water anymore, don't throw litter anymore etc.

And other things which I CAN DO. But don't expect me to do something out of my pay grade.","2019-10-05 13:04:00","3","9","0.52","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ddmzt0/im_fed_up_with_greta_worshipping_and_revolt_posts/","True","cooltechpec","1747925420.577559","carbon footprint","manual"
