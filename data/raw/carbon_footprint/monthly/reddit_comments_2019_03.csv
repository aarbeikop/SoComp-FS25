If money is an issue, work out what changes you can start with that will cost you the least, but help financially in the long run. For example, I bought trash cans to rig up as a rain water system so I can keep my veggies and shade providing natives alive during severe drought, water rationing, and raising water bills. Updating to a less dilapidated bike and getting baskets is cheaper than buying an electric car, saves me gas money, and has improved my health dramatically (nice legs without a gym membership!). Cutting up old t-shirts and using a jar of cleaner instead of buying disposable wet wipes saves resources and cleaning product bill that used to make my husband complain every time we ran out of cleaning supplies. Signing petitions with a group like Change.org means you can help lend your voice for positive changes like more wildlife protection and human rights, without any cost to you, unless you choose to donate.

There is a lot of value in just learning what you can about global warming, and working out which eco-friendly activities work best for you, then sharing that info with people around you. My friends and family used to kinda tease me about my weird quirks like gardening, making shopping bags out of old clothes, hassling people to remember their bags, making my own cleaning stuff, getting my bike fitted with baskets to ride to the grocery store, etc. However, since more info has come out about our affect on the planet, and I've been able to share the benefits of the little actions I take, more have started trying to make changes themselves. I even get reminded to bring my reusable take out containers, and pack with straws, napkins, cutlery, and salt/pepper shaker, because the people around me have started seeing the value of having these reusable items instead of using single use items when we eat out together. Climate change, pollution, and the apparent apathy of humanity can be pretty overwhelming, but Rome wasn't built in a day, the World Wars took years to win, with civilians all pitching in to reduce their consumption, recycle, and pitch in whatever work they could, like growing their own food. We've faced plagues, wars, famines, and all kinds of huge problems before, but by working together, and focusing on whatever we can do to help, we can overcome the seemingly impossible. About a decade ago I felt like I was going crazy because it was like everyone was in total denial, would laugh at you for wanting to help the environment, and just totally gave zero fucks. Then I guess the fires, sever storm events, floods, unforgiving droughts, etc. started getting hard to keep brushing off, and people are suddenly willing to make changes, starting to look for solutions (your post is evidence of this). 

Never underestimate the power of one person to make change, or to inspire others to change. It's seriously amazing what one person can accomplish on their own, and awe inspiring what we're capable of once we start working together :)","2019-03-03 19:42:51","14","sheilastretch","1747909731.422223","carbon footprint","manual"
"ehppkyb","t3_awvtun","awvtun","climatechange","action-oriented","One person alone might not be capable of much, but the collective effort of everyone will truly make a difference. You can encourage your friends and family to help out and do their part, and tell them to tell their friends. 

Just a small personal example: when I bought an aluminum reusable water bottle, I told my friends to do the same and now we bring them everytime we go out. We also organize beach cleanups together during the warmer months; you would be surprised at how much trash is left behind some people don't take any responsibility for the waste they produce – it's disgusting.

You're right about the large manufacturing corporations producing most of the emissions, to my knowledge all we can do is pressure governments to enforce more environmentally conscious practices regarding emissions and production. Perhaps we would have to rely on technology to mend the environment issues – in their current state at least. To do this maybe we should be spending more resources on advancing public education as to inspire young minds to think about the future and be environmentally conscious. Maybe cheaper or free college would encourage development and growth as a population.

Its hard not to feel overwhelmed or hopeless in these efforts because a lot of times it seems like the masses and the corporations are not going to change unless they see the more immediate impact of climate change – they don't care until it affects their life. But if you are truly trying your best, that's all you can do I suppose.

You might think you'll be long dead by the time any major disaster happens, but we are already seeing disastrous effects from current environmental practices: ocean acidification killing off reefs and wildlife, smog so bad in cities like Xiangyang, China, Dehli, India, and Mexico City, Mexico is so bad that there are days where people are advised not to be outside, weather patterns and temperatures are becoming inconsistent, and there are massive islands made of plastic and chemical sludge floating in our oceans – one in the Pacific Ocean is nearly twice the size of Texas. That said, it would be wise not to take our comfortable lives for granted.

To but this all in perspective: not a single item of plastic ever made has fully decomposed. Future generations – assuming humans are alive – are going to be dealing with the mess created by environmental practices thus far for centuries.

TLDR; We can't do much alone, but if we urge our friends, family, and community to make a difference on a personal level and by standing up to the corporations and politicians who are sitting idly by while they profit at the expense of future lives.","2019-03-03 18:41:28","9","niceboy4431","1747909731.428564","carbon footprint","manual"

"ehri5v1","t3_awvtun","awvtun","climatechange","action-oriented","> But honestly, what can one person really do? 

Unite others. Whenever there is a problem which can't be solved by one's own efforts - collective effort is the only answer. However, in this case, uniting per se will not be enough, because there are powers that be which look to corrupt and disable such collective efforts. Therefore, even before starting to anyhow coordinate collective effort, it is required to properly foresee how and why any collaboration of the kind could be corrupted and/or opposed, and find ways to avoid that. One particularly useful consideration is to exclude any plans and activities which could anyhow endanger profits of the corporate world.

And you don't need to start this action global-scale. You can always start small: try to make your neighbours / friends / family aware and willing to do something - even if a little something, - about climate change as a group. 

Like, for example, achieve an agreement within the group to never use anything bigger than a small city car, make the group publish its decision, and perhaps being a start of a larger ""small cars only!"" movement in your city / region / country. Could even get global. Point is, learning to make do without any large SUVs / multi-ton cars not only helps to reduce emissions, but also saves on fuel bills, _and_ in the same time makes oil business remaining more profitable in observable future, by slowing ongoing global oil EROEI decrease. It's a win/win/win solution for said parties (world / car owner / oil business), and only corporations which would not like such a movement - are car makers. Well when it's oil business vs any other business, some chances are the former will win, so i'd say this worth a try. 

But chances are, even with your own neighboorhood, you'll find it's quite difficult to convince people about such a change, though. Quite many _want_ them SUVs and such, and quite many could afford fuel bills easily. One advice: don't waste your time if you see with high confidence than any particular person will not for any reason join the effort; instead, move on to find more people, some of whom might. Learning from one's mistakes on this small scale will help. ""Practice makes perfect"", you know. So, maybe you'll be good at it one day, and maybe you'll see yourself able to try larger scale of doing it. Maybe not. But without trying, you'll never know. Ultimately, while in itself having some minority to use smaller cars won't any significantly tackle climate change, - one's ability to organize and motivate that minority may end up the key thing to future attempts to do something actually major about climate and its effects on human communities, even if regionally.

> What REAL impact can one single individual make about climate change?

Create powerful enough ideas, propose widely accepted solutions, etc. One can be a start of really big and mighty useful action this way. Example: James Lovelock invented his electron detector and with its help, demonstrated to the world that certain chemicals then-used on a large scale - certain kinds of freons, - rapidly destroy Earth's ozone layer. Nowadays, those chemicals are not used anymore. Industrial usage of those chemicals is banned. James was able to communicate out powerful enoguh idea for the whole world to change its ways about that particular issue. Similar can be done about climate change, or at very least some of its implications. Would take a brilliant mind and years of effort, though.

> I truly doubt that a non-average person can make a difference on their own.

It's unlikely, but in the same time - doable, as per above.

> Would it even matter if a multi-millionaire spend all of their money buying land & planting trees to offset carbon emissions?

No, it wouldn't. Please understand that trees do not ""offset"" carbon emissions any much, for the simple fact that every tree dies sooner or later, and then has almost all of its carbon released back into athmosphere once its wood is decomposed back into CO2, bit of CH4 and water by rotting and such.

> Industrial emissions would need to be heavily regulated

No. Regulations have no good effect if they can't be enforced. However, nothing can truly ""enforce"" corporations, as long as corporations are the largest force around. It's them corporations which can and will ""enforce"" things which are truly important for them. 

Also, please understand that not all humans are made same and equal. Relatively small percentage of humans are born without ability to feel compassion, for example. It is not their fault, as research indicates this is a genetic thing, prominent since very early age of 3...4 years old, in such individuals. And then, ""career selection"" pushes many of such people to the top, simply because ruthlessness is more profitable in business. They do get higher profits, the ""cruel"" ones. Unfortunately, they also act mercilessly whenever opposed. And some of them are quite bright and smart, too. In public, they behave as if they are noble and kind and honest, because this sort of social mimicry makes their betrayals stronger. Ones who made to very top are also highly experienced in all kinds of ""under carpet"" struggle, and thus are highly effective to remove any danger to themselves, their position in the corporative world, etc. 

Much like natural evolution creates species most capable of surviving, - ""corporate evolution"" does the same. And in nature, this is achieved via all means possible, - including killing, eating, poisoning, even mind-controlling (famous fungi-on-ants case, etc) opponents. Corporate ""top"" is not much different. And it'd be as silly to ""blame"" them about it as it'd be to blame a tiger for killing a lamb. Both do what their envoronment and genes shaped them to do, quite very much. And modern social environment humans are much affected by - includes plenty non-genetic information from their peers and mass media, of course. Sadly, as much of such information itself is a subject of manipulation done only with short-term monetary motives, - human behaviour in general rapidly deteriorates nowadays, which of course is not helping. And there is also ""dumbing down"" policies / phenomena, which perhaps is most dangerous of it all.

Still, there are few other kinds of people who despite all the above remain able and willing to devote part of their life effort towards long-term and/or non-monetary goals. Those are ones who can and should be united in a working manner, if anything actually useful about / related-to climate change is to be done on global scale.

> Technology is the only other answer that I see

Not an answer at all. Technologies are _tools_, only. For example, nuclear weapons is a technology which kills life, including humans, on a mass scale, - but can also be used to deflect certain kind of an asteroid which would otherwise hit the Earth and cause mass death. For another example, a hydro power technology can both provide sustainable electrical power for large regions, and in doing so save great many lives via air conditioning, home heating, etc etc, - but can also result in catastrophic flooding of large areas, causing massive loss of life. I.e., even without human intent to use technologies in this or that way, consequences are often _both_ good and bad. By using ""more"" technology, if done only for the sake of ""getting higher-tech"" and nothing much else, - you'll get more of both. Problem is, good consequences are ones which are known and intended (for those consequences technologies are created in the 1st place), while bad ones are often unexpected and often times are even impossible to know before they hit. For example, long-term (decades) effect of many modern medications just can't be known in advance, since it'd take decades of clinical studies on large number of patients to figure them out. And obviously, global climate is yet much more complex thing than human body, so for climate change, many technologies' long-term effects are mostly unknown in advance. I say that's not a way any ""solution"" works.

> I'd like to help, but I just don't see anything that I do is going to make any significant difference.

I see it, though. You just did this post in here. It helps, if a tiny bit. But it does. There is no large-scale action without planning and collective effort. And both of those require discussion and understanding. Your here post helps to achieve a bit of both. Do enough of those, and things will move towards planning, coordination, and then effective action (if only for limited - but realistically achievable - goals). 

I'd say it also helps very much to have more people with clear understanding of what's going on with modern mankind and with Earth climate in particular. As such, it helps if you study those things as best you can, and then share the understanding with others.
