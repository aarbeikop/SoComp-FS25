* An A4 sheet of paper used to print documents at office has about 12 gms of CO2e requiring a medium size (15 ft wide) sugar maple tree about 2.5 hrs to absorb

* A paper coffee-cup used to serve coffee at a coffee shop has about 0.5 KgCO2e that requires 4 days to absorb

* If I were to shower in water that was 1C colder than normal, I would save 0.7 KGCO2e i.e. 6 days of absorbtion time

* If I were to drive 10 km/hr faster in my morning commute (of 5 kms), I would be emitting 0.5 KgCO2e more requiring 4 days for the tree to absorb

As mentioned above, these are ballpark numbers but I've begun to use them to guestimate my daily carbon footprint & see how I can reduce it.

Do you have any similar scenarios that you want me to estimate?","2018-04-03 02:05:12","1","bearhugger404","1747887796.550133","carbon footprint","manual"
