Reduced volatility in resource markets (reduced international exploitation v. Resilient use) should also help alleviate abrupt changes that are used for leverage to further exploit populations.

Just from reading the title of the post I knew this would be about agenda 21.  I won't deny that certain things about that topic have been said by people in power.  However they said something like ""if things get really bad then we might have to do X or Y or Z to keep everyone alive.""  Then the conspiracy theorists decided that X and Y and Z is the Illuminati's unchangeable plan for humanity.

Here is the thing: anything can be used for oppression.  It depends on the society and if the society allows for the rise of an oppressive dictator.

You aren't going to see many outright bans.  Certain things will get more expensive either because they get scarce or because governments recognize them as damaging and tax them heavily.  Meat for example will never be banned.  But more on this in a bit.

You've heard the phrase ""The freedom to swing your fist stops at another person's nose.""  Over time population density rises and we develop more powerful tools that increase individual's agency and as science proves more interconnections.  This means that the reach of your punch gets further and more powerful.  And the other person's nose gets closer.  Changes to laws and regulations follow.  Is this oppression?

300 years ago if you wanted meat you went out and shot it.  Now gun ownership is more onerous and you have hunting seasons and hunting licenses and bag limits and tags.  Oppression!  No.  We've got more people and less wilderness and more powerful firearms and less wildlife and are aware of how we could ruin mating populations and drive animals to extinction.

You are going to see a lot more of that sort of thing.  It won't be reserved for the 1% and banned for everyone else.  Either the price will go up or it will be regulated down to sustainable levels.","2019-09-27 14:40:05","3","parametrek","1747923977.653159","carbon footprint","manual"

Transportation: Coffee is pretty light and it's shipped in bulk. I only go through about 12lbs a year which is probably not a large carbon footprint from the shipping compared to the rest of my carbon footprint. 

Packaging: I buy my coffee from the bulk bins at grocery stores or the food coop and I reuse the little bags 3 or 4 times before they are worn out. I could instead bring a jar which would probably even keep it fresher.

Farming practices: This is more tricky to measure and track but you could look into some of the brands that are available in your area in bulk bins. I like the equal exchange brand but I havent done much research on them. This is also somewhat tricky since people have different values around farming. Are you concerned with how much the farmers are getting paid or just the climate aspect? I'm not sure about coffee farming in particular, but I've worked on several small orgainc vegetable farms and given some thought to the impacts of farming. Counter intuitively, sometimes large scale monocrop farming with huge equipment can actually have a lower carbon footprint than small diversified farms since they can grow such huge quantities of food. Another counter intuitive example is a pesticide or fungicide might reduce damaged crops and increase yield per acre. These practices have other serious drawbacks to sustainability including insect collapse and chemicals leeching into groundwater but they might not look so bad from a strictly carbon footprint perspective.","2019-09-27 19:03:30","2","[deleted]","1747924553.159203","carbon footprint","manual"
