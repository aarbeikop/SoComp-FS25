"da0d22","collapse","skeptical","What if climate change is used for oppression?","I believe global warming is real and our environment is screwed and we are looking at severe problems. Just some background, I am an ex fundamentalist Christian so keep this in mind, deconverted three years ago. I used to believe Agenda 21 was a problem, new world order, some conspiracy stuff too. Agenda 21 conspiracy theories, said that global elites were using climate change and that climate change was a hoax, meant to grab world resources and used for oppression. We were told in fundie circles that the elite wanted to do depopulation. [Think Georgia Guidestones and all that crap]. I escaped the fundies but I have had to deprogram myself from a lot of crap. I was in churches and very conservative communities where no one believed in climate change. Where I live now, only a few fellow liberals and UUs believe anything is going on. EVERYONE ELSE DENIES IT.

I of course changed from these views after studying science and no longer depending on a 2,000 year old book for reality testing. 

That said, what if the rich and powerful, decide to use climate change for a money clean out, and to oppress the poors. It would be easy for them to take the air conditioning away from poor people in first world nations ensuring more death and suffering and to change food to ""soylent green"", already food in America is processed into a bunch of low nutrition slop.  They could make rules oppressing the third world about the use of resources, access to food--probably some of that is already happening.

They could issue endless rules that still enrich themselves, while living in their giant mansions, and jet setting across the planet. I don't trust those assholes even now as a post-Christian agnostic to really fix anything. 

So they could issue edicts, that one can only eat meat once a week, air conditioning is stripped out--I'll be dead from severe lung problems and the constant heat--in the first world, deny cars and transportation---car-less city stuff freaks me out because I cannot walk well and destroy the food even more---I refuse to eat that GMOed to death 'impossible burger"" stuff they are pushing and make lives even harder using the environmental crisis to oppress people further.

They won't change or give anything up. They still want their endless vacations, new toys, consumerism and profit. I agree with people who say capitalism is unsustainable, but I hope people are realizing no ""world leaders"" are going to fix these problems. 

Grassroots may be the only way, but then what do you do about the fact that most lives are dependent on a modern industry? We live in a system where we need modern things to literally stay alive, like refrigeration, medicine, etc.

Instead of pouring money into war, and military, countries should be pouring money into researching and changing the system for environmental sustainability. My worry is their ideas for ""climate change"" will just be about oppressing the poor and still wanting to earn their billions in profit. Maybe I got left over fundie influences but I don't trust any rich or powerful people who only care about their status.

I live a life now with a low carbon footprint. I can go a year without leaving my county easy. I buy everything used even clothing if I can obtain it. I buy from vegetable stands and organic farmers. I can't grow my own food and don't have money to prep or do permaculture things but I do not live the same life as the ""typical American"". I am of the involuntary simplicity set.

There's a lot of waste and greed out there. So some folks have to change things on an individual basis. 

I think our society to deal with climate change, needs a more bottom up approach but then outside of a real grass roots movement to change society from the bottom up, where there's more attention to sustainability and more and reformating the economic system, and dedicating monies to research more then war for scientific solution, we are screwed. 

There's definitely no god in the Christian sense or a ""divine planner"" to have made an animal with the ability to screw up an entire planet just from trying to get it's emotional and physical needs met. 

By the way, I was not going to last with fundies too long as I love to read, and non-fiction at that. I read multiple books on climate change including ""The Water Will Come"", all this information CHANGED my MIND. 

Please tell me if you have concerns about leaders using climate change for oppression. Maybe this is just some left over vestiges of my fundamentalist indoctrination or maybe some of you have some of these concerns.

If you are Republican or denier, please don't answer this post, I've heard all that before. I am seeing and experiencing definite changes to the climate I live in that cannot be denied.","2019-09-27 13:24:27","47","59","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/da0d22/what_if_climate_change_is_used_for_oppression/","True","fivehundredpoundpeep","1747923975.235988","carbon footprint","manual"
"d7fk7p","collapse","skeptical","Climate Change and Veganism","**Introduction**

Climate change, despite still being denied by many, is a well established theory with overwhelming evidence to support it. Climate scientists have been warning governments around the world for decades to take necessary steps to reduce global carbon emissions to avoid climate catastrophe, but so far not enough has been done to combat this major problem.

&#x200B;

**Effects of climate change**

The destabilisation of the climate negatively impacts just about every area of life. Below are three areas of life that are being impacted due to climate change:

**1) Ecosystems**

* **Erosion of the coral reef** \- “experts project that 90% of the world’s reefs will be gone by 2050. Coral reefs are among the earth’s most precious natural resources. They harbor a million species and provide food for 500 million people around the world. But warming waters, pollution and overfishing have badly damaged these precious ecosystems; roughly 50 percent of the world’s corals have been lost in just the last 30 years. [http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/](http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/)
* **Species extinction** \- “Human-caused climate change appears to have driven the Great Barrier Reef’s only endemic mammal species into the history books, with the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lives on a tiny island in the eastern Torres Strait, being completely wiped-out from its only known location. It is also the first recorded extinction of a mammal anywhere in the world thought to be primarily due to human-caused climate change.” [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change)
* **Toxic red tide** \- ""Florida is having a 10-month streak of toxic red tide. This so-called red tide has killed hordes of marine animals and is entering its 10th month of existence—making it one of the longest-lasting cases documented to date...According to Glibert, there are two key factors contributing to this worldwide shift: increasing nutrient run-off from farms, lawns, and other land-based sources, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns occurring as a result of climate change. [https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632)

**2) Social**

* **Water** **shortages**: ""Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought in many parts of the United States and the world in the decades ahead."" [https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/](https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/)
* **Increased** **nutrient** **deficiency**: “**Climate** **change** will make hundreds of millions more people nutrient deficient. Crops grown in a high CO2 atmosphere are less nutritious, containing less protein, zinc and iron” [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient)
* **Increased** **risk** **of** **diseases**: “After West Nile virus kills 22 people in heatwave, experts warn of more mosquito and tick-borne diseases due to climate change...“ [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise)

**3) Energy**

* **Wind** **turbines** \- “Heatwave knocks wind out of onshore turbines” [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp)
* **Hydropower** **dams** \- ""African nations could face devastating blackouts as rising temperatures dry up their hydropower dams. Based on recent years in which extremely dry conditions saw electricity drop off in large areas, a new report by climate scientists has warned that the trend for dam construction may be misguided.” [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html)
* **Nuclear** **power** \- ""Europe’s heatwave, however, hasn’t just increased air temperatures but also water temperatures. Regulations protecting wildlife mean that the usual water sources drawn on by nuclear plants cannot always be used for cooling, leading to shutdowns. It’s not the first time this has happened: Heatwaves forced nuclear shutdowns or curtailments across Europe in 2003, 2006, and 2015. Worse still, scientists warn that thermal power interruptions will worsen because of climate change—not just because of heatwaves but also droughts. It’s ironic that human-induced climate change is threatening a climate-friendly source of electricity.

&#x200B;

**How can veganism help**

There are many things an individual can do to reduce their carbon footprint, including: have fewer or no children, recycle more, walk, cycle and use public transport more, use automobiles and planes less, use less electricity, and educate others.  
One of the best ways, that is often not talked about, is to go vegan and switch to a plant-based diet.

>“Which diet is best for the environment? **According to the most comprehensive analysis of farming’s impact on the planet, plant-based food is most effective at combatting climate change**. Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, who led the study, said adopting a vegan diet is “the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth..."" [https://livekindly.co/eating-vegan-is-the-most-effective-way-to-combat-climate-change-says-largest-ever-food-production-analysis/](https://livekindly.co/eating-vegan-is-the-most-effective-way-to-combat-climate-change-says-largest-ever-food-production-analysis/)

**1) Less water use**

[https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable](https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable)

* About one-third of the world’s water consumption is for producing animal products.
* According to data from the Pacific Institute and National Geographic, a single egg takes 53 gallons of water to produce, a pound of chicken 468 gallons, a gallon of cow’s milk 880 gallons, and a pound of beef 1,800 gallons.
* Growing crops to feed animals killed for food consumes 56 percent of water in the U.S.
* Animal agriculture is responsible for 20 to 33 percent of all fresh water consumption in the world.
* Because animals are so densely packed on today's industrial farms, they produce more manure than can be absorbed by the land as fertilizer. The runoff from these facilities grossly contaminates rivers and ground water.
* Tyson, America’s largest meat producer, is responsible for dumping more toxic pollutants into our waterways than companies like ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical.
* Animal excrement and agricultural runoff have polluted nearly one-third of rivers in the U.S.
* One hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce—the equivalent of two months’ worth of showers.
* A pound of chicken requires 71 percent more water to produce than a pound of soy.

**2) Less pollution**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock operations on land have created more than 500 nitrogen flooded deadzones around the world in our oceans. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of ocean dead zones…water pollution. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**3) Less environmental destruction**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* The meat industry is the cause of 85% of all soil erosion. [https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/)

**4) Less species extinction**

* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction…and habitat destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Up to 137 plant, animal and insect species are lost every day due to rainforest destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**5) Less energy waste**

* “In general, each trophic level relates to the one below it by absorbing some of the energy it consumes, and in this way can be regarded as resting on, or supported by, the next lower trophic level. Food chains can be diagrammed to illustrate the amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to the next in a food chain. This is called an energy pyramid. The energy transferred between levels can also be thought of as approximating to a transfer in biomass, so energy pyramids can also be viewed as biomass pyramids, picturing the amount of biomass that results at higher levels from biomass consumed at lower levels. However, when primary producers grow rapidly and are consumed rapidly, the biomass at any one moment may be low; for example, phytoplankton (producer) biomass can be low compared to the zooplankton (consumer) biomass in the same area of ocean” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic\_level#Biomass\_transfer\_efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level#Biomass_transfer_efficiency)
* “Th**e ten percent law** of transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next can be attributed to Raymond Lindeman (1942), although Lindeman did not call it a ""law"" and cited ecological efficiencies ranging from 0.1% to 37.5%. According to this law, during the transfer of organic food energy from one trophic level to the next higher level, only about ten percent of the transferred energy is stored as flesh. The remaining is lost during transfer, broken down in respiration, or lost to incomplete digestion by higher trophic level.” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological\_efficiency#Ten\_percent\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_efficiency#Ten_percent_law)

&#x200B;

**Summary**

Climate change is real, human activity has been proven to be a major cause, and there are several things you can do to reduce its impact:

1. Have fewer or no children
2. Recycle more
3. Walk, cycle and use public transport more, and use automobiles and planes less
4. Switch to a plant-based diet
5. Use less electricity
6. Educate others

"d9ad48","collapse","skeptical","[Coping] Cheerful Nihilism in the face of Collapse","I am a regular poster here, but using an alt for reasons. I want to share my ironically sunny view of the inevitable economic/ecological/social collapse of our Earth.

For years I have subscribed to a philosophy I call “cheerful nihilism“. I believe life is inherently meaningless and arbitrary, God is a lie and religion is a tool to control the foolish, suffering is widespread, the mechanisms of power act only in greedy self interest, climate disasters will wipe out life as we know it, etc. However, that’s no reason to be bummed out! I revel in the absurdity of life and take joy in the experiences I am afforded by my privilege. 

Typically I am a straight-laced guy but as the reality of our situation becomes evident and ever more dire, I’ve begun to take more risks. For example I’ve always been a fan of hallucinogenic mushrooms, but they’re so hard to get I started growing my own for fun and profit. I finally got my hands on some acid and it is AMAZING. MDMA is next on my list. I have been going to more shows and doing ever more ridiculous and dangerous fun things because why the fuck not?

Much to the annoyance of [some people](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d81a01/for_as_many_young_people_who_rightly_want_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), I’ve been traveling internationally even more than if I thought the world wasn’t dying. I went to Mexico last year and I’m currently planning a trip to Thailand. Most of the places I want to visit will be underwater soon and who knows how long air travel will even be an option. I want to experience these places and cultures while they still exist. I’m aware of the irony that as my personal carbon footprint expands, I contribute to the death of the planet I am making a point to enjoy more of.

I am not entirely selfish though. I’ve also been volunteering at the local homeless shelter, public arts program, an LGBT advocacy group, and started a meet up. I’ve abandoned all rules and social norms when it comes to my personal life and relationships. This “relationship anarchy“ allows me to have experiences in sex, love, and romance that I may normally be too timid for (don’t worry it’s 100% consensual). I attempt to facilitate community wherever I go. That’s what will help us most in the end times- being able to pull together and rely on our communities in the absence of order and resources.

Of course I’m also taking some steps to prepare. I am setting aside some dry goods and water; planning for electrical outages, heat waves, and cold snaps. I’m taking a gardening class for when food is scarce/unaffordable. I have not yet but want to get involved in the climate protests. I’ve never been in a riot, could be cool.

As objectively terrible as things are globally, for me personally things are going suspiciously well. Being a straight white man with disposable income in a climate-stable region of the US has a lot to do with it. Sure, I have the occasional HOLY FUCK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING panic attack, which is accurate and warranted. Otherwise though, I am calm as Sir Roger on the gallows. I did what I did as hard as I could do it and this is the end of my story. 

As much as I hate the Bible, “Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.” kind of sums up my thoughts here.
