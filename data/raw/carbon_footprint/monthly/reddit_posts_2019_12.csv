"ehw27l","collapse","skeptical","The carbon problem is insurmountable. Let's have some fun with the math and do a sci-fi thought experiment to show how fucked we are!","The average American's carbon footprint per person in 2014 was 21.5 metric tons of CO2 according to the University of Michigan. Let's use these numbers along with some pretend technology and do a little thought experiment to visualize what we're up against. 

These emission numbers represent a whopping 47,400 lbs (21.500 kg) of carbon dioxide per person per year. That's about 130 lbs (59 kg) of carbon dioxide per day per person. Holy shit, right? A family of four is pumping out 520 lbs (240 kg) of CO2 per *day*. Day in and day out, year after year. That's almost their entire body mass per day emitted as CO2. (Let's be realistic though... The average American is way heavier than 130 lbs.)

Let's set a lofty, albeit ultimately necessary goal and see what we're facing. We not only need to curb carbon emissions (which is not only *not* happening, but emissions are accelerating as I think most of us here know), but we also need to pull that carbon out of the atmosphere to even begin to attempt to undo climate change. Literally, let's imagine pulling some carbon out of the air! 

To that end, imagine a theoretical device that runs entirely on non-carbon emitting energy sources, draws in CO2 from the atmosphere, and outputs pure oxygen and carbon. Let's also say the carbon comes out in pure graphite form. 

In order to return the atmosphere to pre-industrial times, we'd need to be zero carbon emissions while our mythical machine produces 35 lbs of graphite per day per person. (That number accounts for elemental carbon only making up 27% of the mass of the CO2 molecule.) And that's just for Americans. Our average family of four would need to draw a 140 lb (63 kg) brick of graphite from the atmosphere per day. At 0.641 g/cm3 for graphite, that's about a **154  gallon (583 liter) block of graphite every week.** And that fucker would weigh over a thousand pounds. It's laborious enough to collect garbage... Imagine what it would take to haul away 1,000+ pounds (450+ kg) of graphite a week for every average household in America! And that's week after week, year after year, for all the time it takes to repair the atmosphere... It's beyond absurd. But that's what it would take, or something equivalent. It's not likely possible, practical, or feasible, even scaled up. 

The problem we're facing is comical in its proportions. I thought it would be fun to imagine this all from a literal carbon perspective and do the math. Please correct me on any calculations, I did it all very roughly!","2019-12-31 02:01:11","118","45","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ehw27l/the_carbon_problem_is_insurmountable_lets_have/","True","TheBroWhoLifts","1747928003.60335","carbon footprint","manual"

But he said decreased rainfall and a lack of remediation of the land  degraded by flames and agriculture meant some of the millions of tonnes  of carbons from this year's bushfires would remain in the atmosphere.

""If there were no changes in fire frequency over time, it would be carbon neutral,"" he said.

""\[But\] carbon neutrality breaks at the point where you start burning more than regrowth can catch up with.""

Professor  Bowman said we may already have entered a ""*slippery slope of negative  feedback*"" where forests become sources of carbon instead of carbon  sinks.

""The *nightmare scenario* is that because of climate change, the forest isn't able to recover itself,"" he said.
