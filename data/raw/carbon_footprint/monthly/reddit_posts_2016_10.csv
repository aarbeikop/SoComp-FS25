**IMF says global debt tops $152 trillion, urges some to spend more**

>Global debt, both public and private, reached 225 percent of global economic output last year, up from about 200 percent in 2002, the IMF said in its new Fiscal Monitor report.

>The IMF said about two thirds of the 2015 total, or about $100 billion [*sic*, meant *trillion*], is owed by private borrowers, and noted that rapid increases in private debt often lead to financial crises.

That typo in this article is telling: What is the reality, the physical basis, of these astronomical numbers?

You take out a student loan because you are confident in your future. Your subsequent trips to pawn shop come with much less optimism. But those who have lent out over twice the annual economic product of Global Civilization, and at a historically low rate of interest, must hold an unbounded confidence in the future. They do expect repayment, preferably with some actual gain, don’t they?

>""I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today"".

J. Wellington Wimpy made that frequent promise in the classic *Popeye* cartoons. Loaning $152 trillion at interest seems to presuppose that there will be much more hamburger in the future. If the production of an additional quarter-pounder (without cheese?) requires sixty liters of fresh water and results in two kilograms of carbon footprint, maybe that is a bad bet.

How will a small planet with rapidly declining resources repay this incredible debt? What will support the future prices of equities, real estate and collectables? Will your retirement plan return you hamburger or cockroach milk?
 
Their stock answer is ‘Do not worry, Technology will solve everything’. Never mind the appended qualifier, ‘Past performance does not guarantee future results’, we are all fully invested in this enterprise. *Caveat emptor* is the Latin for ‘fuck you’.
