Sustainability can be an overwhelming endeavour so my list is going to be pretty food focused and easy steps to get started. 

1) Eat less meat, start with something silly like “Meatless Monday’s”
2) Meal plan, eat leftovers, and reduce food waste. And use reusable grocery bags.
3) Bring reusable containers with you when you eat out
4) Walk or cycle to places close to you
5) Change your lightbulbs to CFLs or LEDs. Use natural light in the day.
6) Turn your thermostat down a couple degrees. Open the blinds to let heat in to passively heat your home. Open windows to create airflow rather than use AC.
7) Use a reusable water bottle. 
8) Check out thrift shops when buying clothes. A lot of times you can find practically brand new clothing for cheap. 
9) Try to buy food from within 100 km of where you live. Farmers markets are great for this
10) Reusable beeswax food wraps are a great alternative to Saran Wrap. 

These are ten low-disruptive ways to become more sustainable. Other people may have more things to add, but I’d stick with this list until they become part of your habits and second nature. I wouldn’t try and go further until this is mastered as that is an “unsustainable” start to a lifestyle change. Baby steps. Don’t let people say that you need to make big changes or you’re not doing enough. If you hit half this list you are doing great! It’s about starting!

Reusing stuff or repurposing stuff. I save empty containers, so for example a used up moisturiser jar is actually quite useful so it gets cleaned and used for another purpose.

I can't tell you how many times I've been in somebody's home, it's \~72F degrees inside with the AC running, and \~60F degrees outside.  Huge waste of energy considering you could just open the windows and take advantage of zero-carbon, free cooling.  But we're so used to just turning a blind eye and letting the HVAC system do its thing to keep our desired temperature.

Recently I've become very interested in energy-passive buildings, such as Earthships and other earth-sheltered or high-mass homes.  Some of these homes are in the desert of New Mexico and literally use zero energy to cool the air.  Pipes or ducts will pull air from outside through low-temperature soil underground, providing cool air into the space.  The occupant opens a window near the ceiling and the hot air naturally rises out, creating suction to pull the cool air in through the underground ducts.  No compressors, no fans, just zero-energy air conditioning.
