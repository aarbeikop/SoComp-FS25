Is a new Prius better or is it possible that fixing my old junker has a smaller overall footprint when calculating the impact of mining, assembly, and transportation of materials? How about that $85k hybrid SUV? Organic food (are you sure)?

The calculation is actually pretty simple to generalize: if you spend a lot of money, you have a big environmental impact. Leo DiCaprios and Al Gore's footprints are huge compared to the ""little"" people like you and me, no matter how emotional their message for everyone else to change.

Stretch goals:

I'd love to see this remove barriers to gardening. I don't think I've seen anyone link photos and recipes like that.


If this is linked to a ""when to plant"" alert system for your location.

""Plant today to enjoy this squash risotto, swiss chard and roasted Jerusalem artichokes."" 

There are 5+ plants that are nearly idiot proof in almost any climate. People are just intimidated. You could make a revenue stream from sponsorship seed packs.

You could keep engagement high with a user picture ""nailed it"" style Instagram.
