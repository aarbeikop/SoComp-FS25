And remember our society is a blip on the radar in the grand scheme of geological time. Even the dinosaurs will probably have had a better run than us when all is said and done, with their chicken brains. There's no sense feeling depressed and guilty about humanity's mistakes. You are not responsible for all the world's problems. You're only responsible for yourself. So just try to be a good person and remember to stop and smell the roses even if they're covered in glyphosate. ","2018-09-01 04:56:52","2","paper1n0","1747896888.130357","carbon footprint","manual"
"e6rpwah","t3_9ji8oj","9ji8oj","collapse","skeptical","I’ve dramatically reduced my animal product consumption. I only ever eat animal products when it involves family, which is on average once a week/ish. As my existential nihilism increased so were my lack of emotions towards nonhuman animals, **but** I haven’t dumped my awareness of it all. I’m proud to say I don’t ever pass the meat section at the grocery store.

I didnt know the consequences of animal industry on climate change until recently (1 year tops) so im not your guy.
