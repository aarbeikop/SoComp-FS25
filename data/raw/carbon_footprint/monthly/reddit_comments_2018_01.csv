"dtccsaz","t3_7tg7ik","7tg7ik","collapse","skeptical","Bitcoin stands out because the way it wastes energy and resources is so absurd, its mind boggling but after you realize that resources are finite you start to notice this type of insane wastefulness everywhere. Supermarkets and restaurants throwing away tons of food, not sufficient isolation on buildings, promoting cars instead of more efficient ways of transportation, Saudis burning 1.5 million barrels of oil to desalinate water and much more.

And the worst thing is that everyday we add more and more people to our hydrocarbon party. To get out of this you need to first stop growth and then you can start increasing efficiency in every sector. It doesn't work the other way around.","2018-01-28 00:15:51","25","oskosan","1747884205.2846029","carbon footprint","manual"

I wonder how much energy thats use around the planet ? go to sporting events, how much does that use around the planet ? concerts ?  fly for holidays drive to work? own a meat eating pet (a large dog has the annual emissions of an SUV) ?

Be aware of your impact, work to lowering your annual emissions to about 3-4t.  80% of emissions are from the richest 20%, 50% of emisions from the richest 10%, we know who the filthy fuckers are.  If the richest 10% emitted like the average European, we'd cut emissions by 30%

"dtcoinj","t3_7tg7ik","7tg7ik","collapse","skeptical","I would be delighted to be proven wrong... but I think that you're the one who doesn't what carbon footprint is. Carbon is an element that is released when burning stuff. Like gas and cole. I don't know how computers are powered in your country, but in Canada we make electricity by letting water turn a turbine. So I always cringe when a massive company sending toxic fumes from making their shitty products tell ME that I shouldn't leave my computer open because I cause global warming, and that I should change my lights to shitty LED that are way too bright, hurts my eyes, and have the wrong hue that actually damages the eyes...

How about using the electric metro instead of a car. Or a bicycle. Or helping china get clean electricity instead of burning cole until they can't see the sky.

I agree that bit coins are stupid, but I don't think they can cause lung cancer. Even telling people to stop smoking would stop carbon footprints and global warming better than how they spend virtual money.

But I do resent bitcoins for sending viruses that will mine more bitcoins and waste my processor. I just refrain from installing programs. I don't use bitcoin.","2018-01-28 04:31:15","1","[deleted]","1747884205.295667","carbon footprint","manual"
"dtd0z12","t3_7tg7ik","7tg7ik","collapse","skeptical","I think you are making a mistake to a degree because as the block reward goes down the subsidy to bitcoin miners decreases, within 3 more block halvings the reward will be negligible, and the total economic value driving the electricity consumption via transaction fees will be economically incentivized to move to the scale-free network on the second&third lightning layers being implemented currently. These 2nd layers have near zero energy use per transaction. This economic incentive shifting transactions to other layers makes miners less profitable which makes them shutdown power consumption which causes the difficulty rate algorithm to auto-adjust mining difficulty, and thus electric consumption, downward, potentially drastically. This is essentially proof of stake being implemented in bitcoin in a smooth transitional way. The only argument against what i am saying is if bitcoin price continues  to increase so much that the block reward subsidy continues paying for increasing power consumption. The system will achieve an equilibrium. This is all planned as a way to make miners die off to the minimum level required to provide security for the system and break the energy consumption increase spiral.

Alternatively if the economic dogma of modern economists is correct, then the deflationary aspect of bitcoin becoming a dominant currency would almost completely end consumerism globally which would do much more good for the environment. see the great depression for historical precedent of deflationary times. Not to mention all the middle men and wall street fat cats that won't be able to drive their superyachts around anymore because their parasitic industry got disrupted. If bitcoin destroys banks and fractional reserve lending we won't get ""tomorrows growth today"" by borrowing from the future anymore and growth will slow to the natural rate of increase the economy can produce with real capital formation.

None of the Proof-of-stake coins are proven secure or safe security wise. Once ethereum switches to POS then i would bet bitcoin value mostly flows out into ethereum and the problem will be self solving. It just take a little time. People are already waiting because they hate bitcoins current energy use.

In a few years from now, people will look back and see the mistake they made was looking at things like bitcoin as though they were static protocols instead of looking forward into what they are evolving into. You think the teams of 160IQ freaks aren't solving the energy consumption problems as we speak?  they have to do it sneakily to break out of the miners stranglehold because miners have the perverse incentive to keep the arms race of mining going for their own profits. This is why you saw the huge fight about segwit and bcash and all that other drama.

Yes morally you should sell bitcoin to crash the price and lower its power consumption but if you wait another few years the problems will be solved regardless through technical upgrades.","2018-01-28 12:00:23","1","[deleted]","1747884205.30097","carbon footprint","manual"

In the summer, they can be transported to the opposite hemisphere.  Right now, most of this heat is being wasted.

Until then, as long as Bitcoin continues going up in value because it inflates less than fiat currencies, there is no problem.  If you truly wanted to make a difference in global energy usage, tell central banks to stop printing.  Then cryptos will go down.","2018-01-28 00:53:30","-1","benjamindees","1747884205.3055859","carbon footprint","manual"
