"etl62kz","t3_cc6rl6","cc6rl6","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","there’s a lot of decent carbon footprint calculators on the internet that may interest you, like [this one](https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx) but it focuses primarily on like transportation, which is almost definitely not the majority of your carbon footprint, if you’re considering the food you eat, the clothes you buy, how your house is powered, etc etc. I guess it depends if you’re worried about direct vs indirect though.

As for helping against climate change, think locally; take part in a climate justice group (there’s several in my city I didn’t know about until recently), become active in local politics (sitting in on city hall meetings for example), organize or take part in a general strike with your coworkers (r/earthstrike), etc etc etc.

Something I also don’t see people mentioning enough is wilding their lawns, with native species of plants that will attract pollinators, or literally just cleaning up trash. Even without politically organizing, you can typically help the ecosystem near you become more resilient, it just requires some research. With any luck, there’s conservationists in your area that have websites set up specifically because they hoped someone like you would find it. 

The reason I put so much emphasis on local action is because it’s more likely to reap change that you’ll actually *see*, not to mention local changes are liable to build up to bigger changes. Honestly though, I don’t think anything matters more at this point than building resilient communities that are willing to prepare for increased natural disasters, food shortages, drought, disease, you name it. 

The drastic consequences of climate change were here, over a decade ago— if nothing else, drill that into the heads of whoever you meet.","2019-07-12 09:24:39","5","tubularical","1747921017.669763","carbon footprint","manual"

Personally, I wouldn't adopt. That's a big commitment, all focused on a small number of people, for life.

Curiously I've been accumulating/accommodating much older protégés recently. Individuals who took traditional paths into adult life and gotten screwed over by current culture/economy despite doing everything 'right'.

Older adults take my guidance to heart. And they're perseverant, keep plugging away until they get it right. And they're so pleased when life shifts the way they want it.

"evka6vk","t3_ck46c6","ck46c6","collapse","skeptical","""Society""? What ""society"" encourages or frowns upon - is of little consequence. Societies do not make laws and regulations, nor enforce them, directly by themselves. 

So if you're asking if governments should encourage or simply tolerate suicidal behaviours, - then the answer is, they can't. Every person gone - is 1 tax payer less. They won't cut the branch on which they themselves sit - which is, the population of their countries.

More importantly, however, is that suicide is not doing good for the future. If you want to do some good, you gotta leave a mark. Change something and/or someones for the better. You can't do that with a suicide. As for your personal carbon footprint, - removing it from the pictuire could possibly matter a tiny bit about ~50 years ago or earlier, but nowadays we're already locked in for HotHouse Earth anyhow. At best, your suicide would delay things to come by something like few minutes. Not prevent anything. This is how much i can tell from all the science i learned through the years. 

That said, for sure, i agree that one's life is one's own. If someone seriously, calmly and continuosly feel he must perform suicide - i believe no force on Earth will be able to stop them. One does not need no ""encouragement"" nor ""permission by law"" to do it, anyway. 

Even if it'd be a crime, - noone's able to ""punish"" it for the obvious reason: the criminal is dead, i.e. does not physically exist as a person anymore. However, always remember: anyhow assisting any other person to do suicide - is often seen as a crime and in many jurisdictions is indeed punishable by law, as in this case the criminal is still alive - and can well be punished for doing things which helped to ""remove a tax payer"" from the population over which a government exist.

The latter is why you should never, in particular, use the word ""encourage"" if you speak about suicides. Might get you fined or, even, jailed.
