That human nature, that is to say our human nature, is much more created than it is discovered. We design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work. And so you people … should be asking yourself a question … Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design?"" -- Barry Schwartz

""Human nature"" right now is how humans behave in a competition based society, where screwing other people is good for your own success. 

It's not an innate human quality. In a cooperation based world, people would act differently because acting differently would give them an optimal outcome. Not because they were touchy-feely, but because acting differently would be in their best interest.

Transcending capitalism and creating a society built on organized cooperation would have the potential to save us. Unfortunately, almost nobody understands this, on a global scale. ","2019-02-07 10:41:02","14","cr0ft","1747908642.39806","carbon footprint","manual"

"efxzdbk","t3_anxfge","anxfge","collapse","skeptical","You've nailed the crux issue - human nature. You seem to argue that human nature is bad, that we are unavoidably greedy and cruel.

I have found that when you remove yourself from the dominant culture (by hitch hiking or traveling with little money) the world opens up and so long as you treat others well, they will do the same to you. I ate better from gifts while hitch hiking for a month than I did while at uni. So the idea that human nature is broken is disproved by my immediate experiences.

Why then do humans act so shitty? I would argue it is because we have systemic impoverishment as the status quo. In our world, more for you is less for me, so we are culturally inclined to withhold and find a small group that ""deserves"" our gifts.

So you are right that humans work well in small communities. What is happening right now, I believe, is that all the changes to culture and human nature you desire are happening with no force, because the reality of what we think we want and what that does to the living world around us is increasingly shocking. Something in our hearts rebels. We have a couple generations of materialistc affluence, our American society has had more than enough time to gauge whether more physical goods lead to increased happiness. We know that they do not.

What is a good life, then? It looks different for every person, but it ultimately aligns with their interests. I like animals and the outdoors, so I am devoting my energies to farming using regenerative methods, to be that change I want to see in the word.

For example, imagine if we engineered people to experience the same pleasure from taking care of the environment as they get from sex. Or if we could make people feel the pain of loss of a loved one when a species goes extinct.

"eg83wjz","t3_apefff","apefff","sustainability","action-oriented","In an ideal world, whatever system you’re looking at should have a balance between social, environmental, and economical sustainability. 

Obviously it’s very rare for that to happen, so generally most companies will look towards economical sustainability to make sure they’re still profiting at the end of the day. In contrast, efforts to conserve the environment may have social supports to sustain an organization, but may lack financial support.

When you get into more specific scenarios, it really depends on what you’re trying to achieve. For example with energy generation and net zero concepts. You can try to achieve net zero site energy - a building produces as much energy used on a site, or net zero source energy where the same amount of energy is produced as used at the source (but then you have some amount of energy lost during transmission.

Ultimately it depends on the context of the situation to try to make a win-win situation for everyone and everything.
