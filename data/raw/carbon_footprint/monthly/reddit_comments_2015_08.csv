Could you give a laymen's overview of how solar cells operate and how we currently store energy in case readers aren't familiar with the science/technology?

"cu792z0","t3_3hfja5","3hfja5","science","scientific","I actually worked in a lab in undergraduate (UMD Class of 2010, Chemical Engineering) creating potentially photo active copper oxide films using chemical vapor deposition for water electrolysis [(link to my professor's site and our paper)](http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/CACSE/A-Team/projects/CuOCVD.html)

I now work at the USPTO examining patent applications for thin film deposition, particularly sputtering and PVD. So **my question:** are there any particularly interesting techniques used in the creation of the next generation of solar cells?

"cu79gq1","t3_3hfja5","3hfja5","science","scientific","So one of the things often cited in why solar energy has limited potential is due to the limiting ability to capture the sun's energy. Your approach of imitating photosynthesis on an organic metallo framework is interesting, but I'm curious because natural photosynthesis converts ~[3-7%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency) of the solar energy into chemical bonds. Do you hope to surpass this number? And if so, how?

Also on a side note - how easy is it for you to choose what chemical bonds the energy is stored in? If you could produce a lot of methane from it, it would lead to a lot of new opportunities in hydrogen fuel cells as well.

"cu7f6fc","t3_3hfja5","3hfja5","science","scientific","Hi, I am currently a student studying Chemical Physics and am very interested in researching Solar Cells in the future. However I feel like there is this impossible barrier to get over between people who understand Solar Cells and people who don't. I have read through around 20 different peer reviewed articles on Solar Cells, trying to get a better understanding of what kind of research is being done today. But I struggled trying to understand several of the articles, it sometimes felt like I was reading a completely different language. That's why I am wondering if there is a class or something that can help aspiring researchers understand the jargon and methodology used in current solar cell research today?

My question is regarding biomimetic photosynthesis. How about using protein-based systems & organic approaches?  Of course, the efficiency of natural synthesis is low (~7%) but it could be a good starting point, right?  Do you know of any such approaches/research. I think it will be a good paradigm for artificial synthetic approaches. Could you kindly comment. ","2015-08-19 04:29:43","1","madebymaya","1747831453.660782","carbon footprint","manual"
