"3hfja5","science","scientific","[American Chemical Society AMA] Hi! I am Amanda Morris, an Assistant Professor of Energy Chemistry at Virginia Tech. The Solar Solution! I am here to discuss methods to make solar energy competitive – lower cost solar cells and energy storage through artificial photosynthesis. Ask Me Anything!","Hi Reddit! I am a Professor of Chemistry at Virginia Tech. I was hired as an Energy chemist and my research focuses of solar energy harvesting and storage. At Virginia Tech, I am affiliated with the Center for Energy Harvesting Materials ([link](http://www.me.vt.edu/cehms/)), the Sustainable Energy Thrust of the Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science ([link](http://www.ictas.vt.edu/research/sust_energy.php)), and the Macromolecules and Interfaces Institute ([link](http://www.mii.vt.edu/)). With the American Chemical Society, I serve as an ACS Expert in the field of sustainable energy.

In one and a half hours enough solar energy hits the earth surface to power human civilization for an entire year. Remaining challenges that limit the wide-spread use of solar energy are the development of economical solar harvesting materials and advances in energy storage. Along those lines, my research group focuses on two next generation solar cell architectures – quantum dot sensitized solar cells and hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells. Both of these architectures use inexpensive, nanocrystalline titanium dioxide as the bulk of the solar cell. Therefore, these cells can theoretically be made for a fraction of the cost of a silicon solar cell. Even if the cost of the solar module is reduced, there is still the issue of the intermittent nature of the sun.

So in addition to research on photovoltaics, my research group explores methods to store solar energy in chemical bonds. Nature’s photosynthetic system — a complex assembly of light harvesting arrays, electron transfer relays, and catalytic centers — achieves just that using energy from the sun to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars (our stored fuel!). In our lab, we try to mimic the photosynthetic system with metal organic framework arrays. Metal organic frameworks are porous networks of inorganic clusters and organic ligands. The function of the framework (light harvesting, catalytic, etc) can be tuned by the type of clusters and organic molecules incorporated. We are interested in the guiding principles behind efficient light harvesting, energy transfer, electron transport, and catalysis in these arrays. Check out our recent publications in the areas discussed above:

* http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b03071
* http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am500101u

So feel free to ask me anything about next generation solar cells including dye-sensitized solar cells, quantum dot sensitized solar cells, bulk heterojunction solar cells, and hybrid bulk heterojunctions solar cells, artificial photosynthesis, water oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, metal organic frameworks, and chemistry. I would welcome discuss around the economic outlook for solar energy. Additionally, I would be happy to answer steps we all can take to reduce our carbon footprint and the role solar energy can play in our own households. Lastly, I am open to discussions around academic career paths and diversity in science.

I will return at 11 am ET to answer your questions.

[EDIT] I am here with members of my team (Dr. William Maza, Spencer Ahrenholtz (PhD Candidate), Andrew Haring (PhD Candidate). We are ready to answer your questions! AMA!

[EDIT] Signing off now (12:15 PM ET). I will try to return to continue the discussions that have started. Thank you for participating!

[EDIT] Back on (3:30 PM ET) to try to answer some more questions! Glad to see the discussions kept going!

[EDIT] Signing off again (5:18 PM ET). I hope to come back again to answer the remaining questions!

[EDIT] I will keep returning to answer any more questions that pop up! Thank you for a stimulating discussion!

###Abortion

-Donate to organizations that give women access to abortion. Nothing is more important than abortion, yet nothing will make you more unpopular in some circles than to provide women access to abortion. Most people today have access to contraception. What they don't have access to is an option to use when their contraception fails, when their fetus has birth defects, or when they are raped. [Gail Tverberg donates her money to Planned Parenthood.](http://ourfiniteworld.com/2015/01/06/oil-and-the-economy-where-are-we-headed-in-2015-16/comment-page-2/#comment-51494)

[Every child born in the United States today will add lifetime emissions of 9,441 pounds to a parents carbon footprint.](http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/aug/04/population-climate-change-birth-rates) 

**Donate to:**

[Women on Waves.](https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/donate) Dutch organization that provides abortion to women from countries where abortion is illegal. Personal favorite of mine.

[Planned Parenthood.](https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12913&12913.donation=form1) Provides abortions in the United States, where per capita CO2 emissions are very high and where abortion is gradually being criminalized.

[Marie Stopes](http://mariestopes.org/donate) For women in the UK and the third world.

[Pathfinder fund](https://secure2.convio.net/pf/site/Donation2;jsessionid=1B4F3745D4A13B49027714CAADAF4535.app273b?df_id=5120&5120.donation=form1) for women in the third world.

**Further information:**

[After Tiller](https://kat.cr/after-tiller-documentary-mp4-t9463390.html) Documentary about the last four men and women who maintain a third trimester abortion clinic in the United States. You'll never look the same at abortion again.

###Contraception 

Optimum Population Trust [did the calculations](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/03/carbon-offset-projects-climate-change) and to reduce CO2 emissions by one tonne, requires either:

-£4 spent on contraception

-£8 investment in tree planting, 

-£15 in wind power, 

-£31 in solar energy

-£56 in hybrid vehicle technology.

A single return trip between Sweden and the Netherlands, which emits 0.24 ton of CO2, would thus cost me 1 pound in money spent on contraception to compensate.

**Further information:**

[Jane Goodall on overpopulation in the third world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6JLvIxdbjQ) In most cases, the aid workers were afraid at first to visit the villages, not knowing how the people would react. In all cases, they were thankful they visited, wishing they had come earlier. The culture has changed and people are seeing the effects overpopulation has.

###Immigration

Vote for lawmakers who are pro-choice, but anti-immigration. Those are rare, but they can be found. Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd, well known for his fight against whaling, is [outspoken](https://candobetter.net/node/605) about the need to reduce immigration. 

If the 482 million ton increase in global CO2 emissions caused by immigration to the United States were a separate country, it would rank 10th in the world in emissions. The impact of immigration to the United States on global emissions is [equal to approximately 5 percent](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3f3a7z/iama_greenpeace_climbers_suspended_from_a_bridge/ctkzl6a) of the increase in annual world-wide CO2 emissions since 1980. 

Immigration robs the third world of its most secular, most intelligent, most productive and most dissatisfied share of the population. Those people are the only ones who can stabilize their nations.

###Redwoods

The Redwood tree is unique. Its enormous size allows a redwood forest to sequester more carbon dioxide per acre than any other type of ecosystem. Europe used to be covered in such trees, but they went extinct when carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere declined. After Europeans discovered the Redwood trees, we began planting them too from the 19th century onwards, they are doing well here.

It is a good idea to plant Redwood trees on any land you may have where Redwood trees can grow. As the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increases, the Redwood trees become capable of growing in a wider variety of environments. Unlike other trees, the fact that Redwood wood burns poorly makes it unattractive to people to chop them down in the future. They will also be well protected against the forest fires that are starting to affect the whole planet.

I am planning on visiting Sweden soon. I will try to plant some Redwood trees there on secluded locations, so that hopefully, long after I am dead, giant Redwood trees may grow there. Redwood tree planting is a reverse black swan of sorts. There's a 99.9% chance that the Redwood tree you planted won't do anything to help reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the air. However, in the 0.1% chance that 1000 years from now, your Redwood tree still lives, you have created a Redwood forest!
