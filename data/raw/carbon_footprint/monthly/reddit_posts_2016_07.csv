"4t0g30","collapse","skeptical","Further Evidence that the Paris Climate Accord is a Fraud","Indictment One: The agreement contains egregious loopholes. This is one stunning example of the carbon-counting shell game.

> **Gold’s hidden climate footprint**

>The collapse of the Soviet Union left Bulgaria achieving in the 1990s what the rest of the world is working hard to manage in the 2020s, a reduction in its carbon dioxide emissions of more than 45%.

>But while a lot of inefficient mines and smelting plants have closed, the rump of the minerals industry survived. It is now expanding again, destroying pristine forests and wildlife and raising questions about Europe’s policy of transporting ore across the globe for smelting and refining.

>Vast quantities of raw material are transported by ship, but the emissions caused are not counted because shipping is not covered by the Paris Agreement of last December.

>Two-way traffic: …the banning of the use of cyanide means partly-separated silver and gold ore [from Bulgaria] will be sent to Namibia for processing. Additionally, to feed spare capacity in European smelters for zinc and other metals, ore will be imported from South America.

Indictment Two: The agreement is unenforceable. It is voluntary, and a non-compliant nation will suffer no penalty except a public shaming. Changes in governments or economic conditions are sure to bring changes of mind.

> **Climate change department closed by Theresa May in 'plain stupid' and 'deeply worrying' move**

> One of Theresa May’s first acts as Prime Minister was to move responsibility for climate change to a new Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.

>The news came after the appointment of Andrea Leadsom – who revealed her first question to officials when she became Energy Minister last year was “Is climate change real?"" – was appointed as the new Environment Secretary.

Indictment Three: The goals set by the agreement are much too little, far too late.

>**UK could warm by 4°C this century**

>Scientific advisers warn that, by 2100, temperatures in Britain could rise by twice as much as the internationally-agreed limit set at the Paris climate conference.

>[The Committee on Climate Change] says the UK could, by the end of this century, experience dangerously high temperatures far above their pre-industrial levels. “Global emissions of greenhouse gases will need to peak soon and then decline rapidly for the Paris Agreement goals to be feasible.


>“Even in this scenario, the uncertain sensitivity of the climate to greenhouse gases means there would remain at least a small chance of 4°C or more of warming by 2100.”

>By 2081-2100, warming in the UK is likely to be between 1.4°C and 3.2°C, under a scenario assuming the highest level of greenhouse gas mitigation. The highest emissions scenario, though, suggests a range from 3.4°-6.2°C.

Let us not deceive ourselves. The global community cannot meet the goals of the agreement, so assume that the climate of the British Isles will become four Centigrade hotter.

>The report acknowledges that climate change could offer the UK opportunities, including perhaps increased agricultural and forestry production, if enough water is available and soil fertility is managed.

So Britain can become a significant exporter of pineapples and bananas in the 22nd Century?
