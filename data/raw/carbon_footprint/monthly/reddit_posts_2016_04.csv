"4d85wx","environment","emotional","Need Help with Reducing Carbon Footprint","I'm kind of new-ish to the being green thing. I had no idea that some of the products I was using (laundry detergent, dish washing soap, etc) were hurting the environment so much. I never thought about how much waste K-Cups make. It's not that I didn't care, it's just that I didn't know / think twice.

What are some ways that someone could cut down their carbon footprint? What are some eco-friendly brands that you guys like? Are there some 'normal' things that people do that cause more harm than they think? 

Also, if anyone has any insight to this - I was ordering eco-friendly things on Amazon, then realized that the shipping of the products cause a lot of transportation pollution and have lots of packaging. Does this cancel the eco-friendliness of the products out?

Sorry, just trying to get a handle on everything. Any advice is appreciated! ","2016-04-03 22:04:43","8","14","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/4d85wx/need_help_with_reducing_carbon_footprint/","True","ms_blaze","1747848619.986433","carbon footprint","manual"
"4ev0pi","collapse","skeptical","There Can Be No Bargaining with the Greenhouse Effect",">The Kübler-Ross model postulates a series of emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death, wherein the five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. [Often referenced by the acronym, DABDA]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model

Most of us are no longer intimate with Planet Earth but this DABDA model seems pertinent to these times. Most people still do not comprehend that this Anthropomorphic Greenhouse Effect will bring our extinction, more surely than thermonuclear war. The scientific evidence that supports this truth now increases by weekly installments, conveniently gathered to this sub-Reddit: After reviewing it, if you disagree, then consider yourself to be in *Denial*.

*Anger* is more problematic. Most are still directing their anger at the messengers, another facet of denial. The rest us find ourselves in the position of the evicted tenant farmer in Steinbeck’s *Grapes of Wrath*, who asked, “Who can we shoot?” The answer remains the same: “I don’t know. Maybe there’s nobody to shoot.” Then as now, the responsibility is collective and so, autonomous.

If you have made a direct descent into *Depression*, it is not a sign of weakness but of clear reasoning. Many are still tempted to *Bargain* with the Greenhouse Effect. From the Wiki citation:

>Bargaining — The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle.

I peruse the *Naked Capitalism* blog almost daily, and found this link and commentary by ‘Yves Smith’, the usually astute lead blogger (April 12, 2016).
 
**Can GDP Growth and Carbon Emissions be Delinked?**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF6NxLkKCYk

>This Real News Network segment marshals data to make a provocative argument: there are more ways to decouple carbon emissions and GDP growth than most observers believe. This isn’t airy fairy idealism but a look at the experience of the 21 countries that have increased GDP while lowering their carbon output.

>If there were a full bore effort to tackle this issue, I believe vastly more could be achieved on this front than is now dreamed possible.

Here is the source publication for the Youtube clip:

http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/roads-decoupling-21-countries-are-reducing-carbon-emissions-while-growing-gdp

Of course, this paper is bullshit. GDP is a dubious statistic, the trivial reductions represent the least difficult transformations (not a saving trend), and outside of these 21 cherry-picked nations, carbon emissions continue to rise. Here is a rebuttal that appeared on the same day of Yves Smith saw this glimmer of hope.

**Economic development does mean greater carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions**

http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/lu-edd041216.php

>""Some people argue that extensive investments in green production and sustainable consumption can increase economic growth without increasing the emissions of greenhouse gases. We wanted to test how this connection holds up in reality, taking a global perspective""

>…study of 138 countries is the first ever to take a global approach to the connections between growth, prosperity and ecological sustainability.

>One of the researchers' conclusions is that because of the urgent need to reduce emissions globally, the possibility for an economic degrowth should be seriously considered - that is, a deliberate de-prioritisation of economic growth as a policy objective.

Making a few lifestyle changes will not mitigate the coming catastrophe. By admitting this, you are prepared for *Acceptance*. We can then ask, What will be necessary for Survival?
