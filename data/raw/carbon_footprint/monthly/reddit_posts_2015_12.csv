"3vpkxm","climatechange","action-oriented","I do my part to try and minimize my carbon footprint, but I do not think it matters.","1. ""The Earth"" will be ""just fine.""  If we screw up and can't grow food, or process water for drinking, etc, the Earth /will/ continue on without us.  Life /will/ adapt.  We, humans, are insignificant.

2. We are going to run out of cheap oil.  Easy to get to oil.  Easy to process oil.  We can only change the climate so much from oil if there is only so much oil, and we are going to, effectively, run out.  Additionally, the market already supports fracking and tar sands, both of which are expensive and inefficient.  Now we're trying to buy oil from Iran while the price of oil is low.  This is as good a deal as we are likely to ever get.

3. Many of our power plants use [prodigious amounts of non-renewable energy](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/index.html) (2014, 3_1).  Those that do use renewable energy, like hydroelectric dams, do untold amounts of damage to the environment.  We stopped producing nuclear reactors in the 80's due to well intended, but erroneously founded fears.

4. The US currently has only ~[300](http://www.bna.com/us-desalination-industry-n17179876105/) desalinization plants online.  States have already started arguing over water rights.

5. Ocean acidity?  Over fishing?  If you think the animals going extinct due to poaching is bad, the 2006 numbers for over fishing called the ball at, ""all salt-water fish to be extinct by 2048."" ([NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/science/03fish.html), [Paywall Journal](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5800/787.short))  Given that technology and progress improve exponentially, I reasonably surmise 2048 is optimistic, but I don't have access to the actual paper.  Be the actual date in 2050, 2025, or 2100, it falls under the same category as oil.  ""Enough to hurt.""

6. We shifted from an industrial and production based economy towards a consumer based economy after WWII ([Quora Discussion](https://www.quora.com/When-and-how-did-the-US-make-the-shift-to-consumer-spending-as-a-leading-economic-indicator-replacing-manufacturing-production-and-exports)).  Our personal wealth is now tied directly to our dispensable income.  Contemplate the impact of rising oil prices while you compare this winter's $2/gal to last summer's $5/gal.  To be fair, this issue is the most complex and includes everything from the baby boomers' effects on the job and housing markets, erasure of the middle class, general lack of savings and/or investments, political decisions regarding fair trade/open markets, and countless other facets.

tl:dr: We are a resilient species to the point of stupidity.  At this rate, we are going to lose a game of, ""Don't Go Extinct,"" to a cascade of our own failures.

Climate Change is important, but it's just the tip of the iceberg.","2015-12-06 21:58:03","7","9","0.76","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/3vpkxm/i_do_my_part_to_try_and_minimize_my_carbon/","True","ammoprofit","1747839086.5077078","carbon footprint","manual"
