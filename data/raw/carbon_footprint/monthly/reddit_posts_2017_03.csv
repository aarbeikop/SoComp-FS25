First, I think euthanasia should be a right for everybody, with some limits of course, but that's not my subject.

Because overpopulation is one of the main cause of global warming, I think if you are an elder and you want to help futures generations have the best future possible you should have the right to asked to be euthanized.

We ourselves probably will never live past 90 years old, and I'm pretty sure our children and grand-children will have it worst than us. The elders of this generation had probably the best life in humanity, but at a great cost on future generations.

Maybe accepting to die some few years younger can be a small price to pay for their children and grand children to have an acceptable environment of life.

It would not change dramatically our emissions but it could also be a strong move that could really inspire society.","2017-03-27 20:06:08","1","16","0.52","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/61ul63/do_you_think_if_euthanasia_is_legalized_we_should/","True","justformeandmeonly","1747869740.145694","carbon footprint","manual"
