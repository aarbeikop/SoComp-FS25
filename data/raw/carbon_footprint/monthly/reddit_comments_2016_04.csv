After watching Cowspiracy, I instantly became vegetarian, though vegan is also pushed as an answer. Definitely watch that documentary - it's in netflix - for more information. It's amazing.","2016-04-03 23:45:14","4","[deleted]","1747848622.439025","carbon footprint","manual"
"d1or61v","t3_4d85wx","4d85wx","environment","emotional","Reduce, reuse, recycle, in that order, is pretty standard advice. Buy less (lots of people buy stuff they never use), reuse the stuff you buy (don't buy the latest iphone if your current one works just fine. And if things can't be reused, like K-Cups, look for a better choice), and recycle (including, donate items you're not using, rather than throwing them away).

I also think you can get more ""bang for your buck"" by looking at a couple other things - lower your electric bill, drive solo less and carpool / bus / bike / walk etc more, make your house or apartment more energy-efficient. There are lots of carbon footprint calculators out there, here's a decent one: http://www.nature.org/greenliving/carboncalculator/

It's an amazing organisation based in Australia and their whole blog is about cutting down on your carbon footprint. They have this tool called the carbon challenge too which shows you how to cut out the carbon from your life (it's free). I love them!!! http://www.1millionwomen.com.au/carbon-challenge/

"d1p1cjd","t3_4d85wx","4d85wx","environment","emotional","Eat less meat, go vegetarian or better, vegan. Buy things used, second-hand. Buy things that last forever, old shit -- like cast iron.

Don't buy anything disposable, like lighters, batteries, razors, etc... Instead, use vintage refillable lighters, vintage safety razors, and use rechargeable batteries.

Buy used cars, go electric. Replace incandescent bulbs and use dimmers.

Wear sweaters and turn down the heat in winter. In the summer, use whole house fan at night to cool your house to minimize the need for daytime AC. Better yet, use swamp cooler instead of AC if possible.

Lots of things you can do.

I'm always thinking twice before every purchase considering how much CO2 might be embedded in this item and do I really need it. I've ""thought twice"" about upgrading my laptop for years - it still works but is very old and I can afford a new one but, sheesh, electronics have massive amounts of CO2 embedded in them so I keep thinking twice. Everything has a calculus of CO2 and the world looks very different. ","2016-04-04 00:18:25","1","FF00A7","1747848622.451691","carbon footprint","manual"

If you have to drive, consider switching to a small electric car. If you can charge it with your own charger, and buy green energy that's good.

But individual consumer efforts are almost tokens, compared to the energy choices of corporations and governments. Become politically active. Consider supporting the most eco-friendly politicians possible. I switched from Democrat to Green Party years ago, but temporarily switched back in order to vote for Bernie in the primary. We've also donated to his campaign, because as long as politicians answer to fossil fuel companies everybody is screwed.","2016-04-05 00:38:02","1","HumanistRuth","1747848622.456257","carbon footprint","manual"
"d23mjcb","t3_4ev0pi","4ev0pi","collapse","skeptical","> Making a few lifestyle changes will not mitigate the coming catastrophe. By admitting this, you are prepared for Acceptance. We can then ask, What will be necessary for Survival?

Bit of a redundant question since it starts by saying that we cannot survive. With that settled though, I think a lot depends on numerous factors, most notably, how bad the feedbacks actually get. If they are moderate enough, then there is perhaps a chance of humanity surviving and even thriving in the new world. With catastrophic temperature rise, I'm not too sure, maybe our ingenuity can carry us along if we are at a good location that hasn't been severely affected by Climate Change, otherwise, we'll just have to make sure that we can preserve as much of the environment as possible so that another creature will spring to life before our adventure ends, because, even if society ends and the climate goes to shit, perhaps there's still some fun to get out of a post collapse world, maybe, so long as the sky isn't covered with ash, I guess there'll still be sunsets and sunrises to enjoy. 

Our future is so uncertain at this stage, given the recent ecological and economic developments. We could prepare (get land and get more in touch with the community) and see how far it gets us, but then we have ecological collapse and we have the possible spent fuel rod issue which still seems to range from the apocalypse to a local Chernobyl. Otherwise, if there is no other way, then perhaps it is impossible to reach the acceptance stage because now, with society just about to collapse with the ecosystem and everything else disappearing in the blink of an eye (weeks), what's the point in even getting knowledge about the coming collapse if it is just about to happen and, more likely than not, we will die to the song of men, women and children screaming as the naked ape devours itself. Why force people to go through the stages of grief that they can never complete, let them live their happy consumerist lives, for the alternative is a paralysing realisation that strangles you as you try to get whatever happiness there is out of life before you either throw the noose around your neck or somebody locks you in a cellar for food. Perhaps we can only go in between depression (nihilism) and bargaining (I can prep). Distribute the blue pill widely I say, let people have their happiness, because tomorrow, their existence will be extinguished.
