"77e4bh","collapse","skeptical","Weinstein Predatory Capitalism Vs. World Carbon Socialization","Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer once sponsored a bill that would allow the government to claim 66% of all carbon tax payments, with the remaining 33% going to private citizens. This is predatory socialist capitalism. 

James Hansen wants 100% of your carbon tax payments to be paid back to you, the private citizen, with 0% for governments and corporations. Conservatives agree this is the most equitable and quickest way to unite humanity for survival. 

Both Liberals and Conservatives use Sex, Race and Class politics to prevent this from happening and perpetuate the militarization of tax receipts whether it be social or military.

Ten corporations now buy food from 5 family monopolies in America while in India, small farms produce 75% of food. These 5 families want to monopolize food worldwide. They must be stopped or life on earth will die. 

Carbon pricing food will reduce its energy footprint. Make food great again.","2017-10-19 12:43:04","0","0","0.41","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/77e4bh/weinstein_predatory_capitalism_vs_world_carbon/","True","BeezelyBillyBub","1747880325.789456","carbon footprint","manual"
