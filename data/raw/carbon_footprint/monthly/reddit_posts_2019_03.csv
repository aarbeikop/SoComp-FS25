"awvtun","climatechange","action-oriented","What can one person REALLY do?","But honestly, what can one person really do?  What REAL impact can one single individual make about climate change?

One person making even an extreme change in their lifestyle (such as going from meat-eating to vegan as some suggest) isn't going to make even a minute difference in the big picture. Heck even offing oneself to thus ensure making a no additional carbon footprint in one's future isn't going to make a buy the world a additional millisecond.  Even if the average adult devoted the rest of their lives to fighting climate change (by living the most carbon neutral lifestyle, spending 100% of their spare time planting trees & working with climate change fighting charities) I don't' see where it would make little to no difference.

I truly doubt that a non-average person can make a difference on their own.  Would it even matter if a multi-millionaire spend all of their money buying land & planting trees to offset carbon emissions?  (Seriously, someone do the calculation on this please.)

The only real way to make any effective change is with power & influence.  The bulk of emissions is done by corporations.  So until those stop, climate change will continue.  Industrial emissions would need to be heavily regulated & corporate culture would need to change globally from ""make money first"" to ""go green even if it costs us money & is inconvenient"".  This is highly unlikely to happen, as the world's economy is based on these corporations making money.  Also, even if one major government would regulate its industry, that won't do anything to affect those in other countries (other than to give them an economic advantage).

Technology is the only other answer that I see, but that is dependent in large part on those very industries which need to be regulated.  Also, on having the right person in the right circumstances (i.e., intelligent, educated people funded to do research which probably won't make money) which in large part seems to be luck.

I'm not a climate change expert or economist, or hold any position of power or influence.  I'm just an average person struggling to get by in life (like billions of other people here on this planet), & wishing that I could do something that actually would make a difference.  I'd like to help, but I just don't see anything that I do is going to make any significant difference.  It just seems futile anyway unless those with greater power than me make big changes & I'm not too optimistic about that. So why shouldn't' I just live out the rest of my life the way I've been going & not worry about it?  I'll be dead long before any major disaster happens & its not like I could prevent it anyway.","2019-03-03 16:56:15","18","23","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/awvtun/what_can_one_person_really_do/","True","EarnestQuestioner","1747909728.925958","carbon footprint","manual"

Imagine that the world faced a global catastrophe that would harm all living things on the planet and threaten to bring down the entire human edifice of modern civilization. Imagine that this growing threat would affect the very ability of the human species to feed and sustain itself in the not-too-distant future. Imagine a threat so powerful that its biogeochemical impacts would reverberate throughout the Earth's geologic record for millennia. Imagine that despite decades of warnings by the scientific community of this gathering threat, world leaders chose to downplay, deny, or outright ignore it in order to protect the profits of polluting industries whose money bankrolled their political careers. Then imagine a global society so ill-informed, jaded, and oblivious to these grim realities that they fell into the sway of fascist-leaning leaders who rose to power by fomenting dark undercurrents of fear, racism and xenophobia.

Of course we don't have to imagine such a nightmarish scenario because we are living it, each and every day. The power of corporate money has corrupted the body politic and its decision making process. Rampant mass consumerism has depleted the planet's natural resources and left a trail of toxic waste and environmental destruction. Reports grow [more dire](https://www.unenvironment.org/zh-hans/node/24615) by the day. Contrary to what some may have you believe, [globalization is not unwinding](https://mronline.org/2019/03/04/capitalist-globalization-is-not-unwinding-tncs-continue-to-increase-their-power-and-profits/). Transnational corporations continue to expand their power and profits at the expense of nature and the common good of humanity while western governments abdicate their responsibilities to the supposed benevolence of private capital.

The existential threat of climate change, biodiversity loss, and the multiple other catastrophes from capitalism's infinite growth Ponzi scheme are hurtling us into a barbaric future of societal breakdown in which war, rape, murder, starvation and mass extinction are the end results. Born from this colossal failure of governments to protect their citizenry from such devastation is a courageous group known as Extinction Rebellion. They see the writing on the wall and have organized in a last ditch effort to move the governments of the world to act and mitigate this unfolding disaster. I have the honor of interviewing one of the group's co-founders, Clare Farrell:

**ML**: Tell us a little about your background. How did you help establish XR? What are your goals for XR and what timeline do you have for it to produce results that would satisfy you?

**ML**: Here we are at the doorstep of modern civilization's collapse and most people are worried about their next paycheck or medical bill. We know that organized human societies, the way they are presently structured, will not survive this century with the environmental damage that has already been put into the pipeline, and we also know that a rapid drawdown and cessation of fossil fuel burning is imperative if future generations are to have any chance of survival at all. XR is a work in progress and part of your organization is made up of research groups tasked with working out such technical details. I imagine a new type of economy would be required to replace our current profit-based capitalist system which externalizes environmental and social costs while maximizing short-term gain. A lot of vested interests are preventing society from changing this system. Can you share with us any details on how our society can quickly phase out fossil fuels within the next six years?

**ML**: There are around 454 nuclear reactors around the world with several dozen more currently under construction. At least 100 U.S., European and Asian nuclear power stations are built just [a few meters above sea level](https://truthout.org/articles/what-are-coastal-nuclear-power-plants-doing-to-address-climate-threats/). With [accelerated sea level rise](http://www.johnenglander.net/sea-level-rise-blog/how-long-to-fill-a-soccer-stadium-with-water/) and stronger storms on the horizon, we should be planning right now to decommission and close down these future nuclear disasters. What is XR's stance on nuclear energy?

**ML**: What do you think of people who carry out or consider carrying out violent acts in response to inaction by governments and corporations on climate change? Do you have children? If you knew for certain your children faced a horrible death due to the inaction of such institutions, would your present-day tactics change? Have they not already condemned billions to death? Would you give up your life if it meant the end of planetary ecocide?

**ML**: Who, living today, serves as a role model and inspiration for you and in what way? Do you follow any particular philosophy in your life?

**ML**: What do you think about [geoengineering schemes](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/03/scientists-maybe-if-we-only-dim-the-sun-a-little-it-wont-backfire-horribly/) by scientists to dim the sun in order to reduce global warming and buy humanity more time to ""fix"" the problem? Proposed technology that could pull CO2 out of the atmosphere at the scale required is generally considered a [pipe dream](https://cleantechnica.com/2019/03/14/air-carbon-captures-scale-problem-1-1-astrodomes-for-a-ton-of-co2/)? Do you think our society will ever loose faith in the capacity of technology to solve are problems and if so why and when?

**ML**: One thing that struck me about another XR co-founder, Roger Hallam, was the story he told about his organic farming business which became more untenable over the years due to crop failure from increasingly unpredictable weather in Wales. His business finally went belly up and another farmer he knew commented that growing conditions had become so unpredictable that simply plunking your money down on a casino table would be a surer bet. How do you see the world feeding itself in such an uncertain future, especially when industrial monoculture is actually [increasing worldwide](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190206161446.htm)? This would be another area of interest for XR's research teams.

**ML**: What do you think of the Dark Mountain Project whose members have ""stopped believing in the stories our civilization tells itself""? What new stories should we be telling ourself in this age of ecological catastrophe?

**ML**: I understand wealthy countries have much larger carbon footprints per capita than the rest of the world due to our inherently unsustainable set of living arrangements, but the other much overlooked factor is overpopulation. We are adding roughly 90 million more people onto the planet per year, many of which are striving to attain a similar western standard of living. Is there any ethical way to control population growth or will nature be the final arbiter? What do you think is the maximum carrying capacity for the Earth's human population?

**ML**: Many mainstream scientists feel that to “work within” the system, they have to use language that politicians and other economists can understand in order to maintain credibility, i.e. the “value of ecosystem services”. Attempting to place a monetary value on every aspect of nature appears to be a major flaw of our current economic system. We threw the precautionary principle to the wind and, in the end, failed to understand that nature was priceless! Is XR a proponent of making ecocide an International crime?","2019-03-14 21:08:32","16","13","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/b15tu8/1st_draft_for_interview_with_extinction_rebellion/","True","xrm67","1747910376.853955","carbon footprint","manual"
