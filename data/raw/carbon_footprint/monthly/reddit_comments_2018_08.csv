Also, I have not seen a single firefly in my adult life. It's actually quite tragic.

Fish in the Mediterranean are so rare these days, it's like winning a lottery to see something bigger than 30cm. Of course people fly to Palau...

I think from an American perspective the travel urge comes from the bankruptcy of our culture. At the altar of cheap gasoline we built a culture contrary to the organically historically created culture of elsewhere. So instead of trying to engage in the boring building of a more natural culture embracing locality and family; we just go observe another culture more engaged in the flow of time. 

I think the cultural touchstones of epic movies, travel docs, etc makes travel seem more worthwhile then getting to know your locality and its ins and outs.

In the USA embracing local history, appreciating local culture and supporting local agriculture is deemed the boring domain of nerdy hippies. Not cool like the instagram worthy travel and vanlife photo spreads.

"e3g09zw","t3_93tm5r","93tm5r","collapse","skeptical","Here's an activity, try arguing this from both sides--that air travel is unethical and that air travel is ethical. For the average joe. It's easy to argue why it's unethical, it's extraordinarily polluting, which almost seems like too kind a word these days, as if it's just soot that will eventually settle. How about it's literally destroying life on earth? You can go Rick Steeves on me and say that travel is the path to enlightenment or something, but so far the dividends are absent on people's vacations leading them to virtue that might collectively aid the greater good. Or if we are currently enjoying these dividends then god help us all.

For the opposite I can only say that there's an impulse to explore and to travel that people possess to varying degrees, some not at all, others are totally consumed by it. Tell some kid trying to join the crew of a ship in the 18th century that he should satisfy himself with exploring the countryside, or with seeing how far a donkey will take him. He won't go for it because the horizons are clearly there and only reachable by sea. Similarly you can only truly go into the unknown for most via an airplane, to seek out the mysterious or merely less homogenized, to actually get outside the walls of the city. My point is that it's a human impulse, and the urge to go into the unknown is present forever in myth, and it can't be satisfied with lame alternatives like go enjoy yourself in the woods rather than go to India. 

Now you can say it's all been done, India is full of air conditioners and trash just like everywhere else. But that denies the fractal complexity of humanity itself, which isn't as easily homogenized as the urban landscape. It twists and contorts, and so there is still much out there to explore, and it's changing in a chaotic and unpredictable way.

That was a shot at it. Anyway, this shift away from air travel has to come from the upper class. We're trapped in status imitation and will likely always be. We might chop off their heads from time to time but the first thing we do is then put on their clothes. I'm eating my lunch with a fork for this reason. Almost everything in my house is just so for this reason. A problem with this is that peace favors the elite being mobile. How do we make the peasants stop wanting horses? I don't know.

Travel is one of my favorite things. Why would I give it up in a vain hope to ""save the world"" when there are no large scale movements by individuals, corporations, or governments? Climate change cannot be addressed without the complete collapse of the global economy and the death of billions.

We either address it, everything collapses, and my small amount of emissions are inconsequential. Or, we don't address it, and keep accelerating down this rediculous path of infinite growth. In this case, my emissions become even more insignificant.

""be the change you wish to see in the world"" etc etc. Look, no one is going to change their lives because I don't travel. Even if I pressured all my friends and family not to travel, even if my whole fucking country stopped traveling, it wouldn't make a bit of fucking difference.

Air travel is something like 8% of all emissions. Great, so the whole world stops traveling and we commune through vr. Well, congrats, we've pushed back climate collapse by a year or five.

It just... Doesn't make a significant difference. You'd be better off pushing veganism or pushing for electrified public transit systems and banning personal vehicles. Not that those will prevent catastrophe, but at least they have a higher potential impact.

"e54te7p","t3_9bog1r","9bog1r","collapse","skeptical","I think you’re on the right track!! You should reach out to the Environmental Defense Fund and ask them for advice in how to best pursue that career.

And remember, you don’t have to fix everything to make a difference.  Ever hear this phrase:  “We don’t have to outrun the bear, we have to outrun the slowest person.”  In this case, we only have to protect enough of the environment long enough for a different collapse to occur before environmental collapse.  And there are a few contenders that are pretty imminent right now, including the peak oil/ resource crunch collapse and an economic collapse (which also becomes even more likely when companies are forced to comply with expensive environmental regulations).  Lets also keep our fingers crossed that we avoid ww3 and then we will be ready to transition to a bright, shiny, new future of learning how to live with less.  

Thank you for doing this.","2018-08-31 02:22:16","12","anotheramethyst","1747894647.366077","carbon footprint","manual"
"e54uykq","t3_9bog1r","9bog1r","collapse","skeptical","Hey OP,

I'm a social worker by trade. I've been doing crisis work for the last seven years going into homeless camps, shelters, homes, and hospitals. Providing therapy, food, whatever I can wherever there are people suffering. It's tough work, depressing to say the least. All the while I am watching the ecosystem collapse and doing my best to support a better world than we have or are likely to get. I want you to know that its okay to be depressed, to lose hope here and there. You clearly give a shit and are paying attention. When you need to rest, rest, then get back up and keep working. It probably is a lost cause but the alternative to fighting the good fight is to lose by non-action.

&#x200B;

For what it's worth even though there are plenty of people who don't care I think that most folks are too tired and too desperate to act. The effect might be the same but I think it helps my attitude to know that its not indifference usually. Use your energy to pull somebody out of desperation and then you can work on saving the world together. Its less lonely. 

&#x200B;

Be safe OP. We've got to watch out for each other!","2018-08-31 02:47:59","11","autistmouse","1747894647.369149","carbon footprint","manual"

I say fuck hope, we don't need it. We can't save humanity from itself at this point, and no amount of prepping can protect someone from the long term consequences either.

That does not mean that we should stop fighting. If we delay the total environmental collapse just one year then we had a great extra year. If we have one more nice summer we can enjoy that will be wonderful! If we have a nice extra weekend when we can drink some beers and grill some locally produced vegetables in a more or less functioning society then that's it, that's our extra weekend, that's our victory!

Go for that law degree for the environment, continue to pick up trash, promote environmental protection further, reduce that carbon footprint even more! I am also doing my part as best as I can. My main plan is saving up for a small solar power plant then reinvesting the returns from that and also saving up for another, bigger one and after that start saving for the next one, continue as long as I can keep going. 

Everybody should continue the work who is aware of the problem no matter what.

"e55m409","t3_9bog1r","9bog1r","collapse","skeptical","Environmental law is a great pursuit, but unfortunately it tends to remain just a pursuit and never a capture. For example, one of my best friends studied environmental law; because she is a good person, when she could not get a job in environmental law because there are more people who want to go into environmental law than jobs for lawyers in that field, she ended up working in Legal Aid and now is working for the Department of Child Safety, fighting losing battle after losing battle.

My sister studied international human rights law. Because one of the only jobs she could get was working 80 hours a week in maritime law, which she hated more than I thought someone could hate a job (she said being fired was the happiest day of her life), she has just now finished her PhD defense of her dissertation in geography, looking specifically at oral histories of the homeless in America and critiquing liberal approaches to homelessness while calling into question the enforced narrative of being housed (for her Master's thesis she first studied the massive tent cities constantly being raided and destroyed by the police outside of Fresno, CA, for example, as well as criticizing the corruption of the area homeless shelters stealing government funding). She will probably have trouble finding a job.

My brother the neuroscientist who did his post-doc at Harvard searched for work for years before he found a job as head of lab somewhere where he could do his own research. It would have been much easier for him if he had sold out and gone to work for a think tank or Big Pharma or any other private employer who would pay him to do the research they want to make money from, but he wanted to do science based in pure inquiry and also out of a desire to contribute to the human connectome project. How many other scientists out there who could have likewise contributed are now working in the private sector doing corporate-funded research?

I'm a writer more qualified by far than my father was when he got the tenure-track position at the college where I am an adjunct. Nevertheless, I'm going to press on in the hopes of being able to teach creative writing one day and not just intro comp, although I often think about giving up and going into the private sector as well, say, doing another degree in web design and e-pub and getting in on the ground on that. However, my passion is for teaching and writing, so I'm going to keep trying. 

I don't know what country you're from, but I know the recession has affected us all, and I know there are more people in law school right now than lawyers. Depending on your particular environmentalist bent and just how radical you are, you might be better off joining Deep Green Resistance, but that's just my two cents. I think at times we need to find other avenues for our energies and sometimes creatively rethink our dreams in the current environment. If I have to stay poor, I can start writing groups and join series in my community.

Good luck!","2018-08-31 13:52:04","1","Unabashed_Calabash","1747894647.394013","carbon footprint","manual"
"e5629m3","t3_9bog1r","9bog1r","collapse","skeptical","Which environmental lawyer has made the world a better place?

If you really wanted to make an impact create a business where you can solve an environmental problem by out competing non environmentally conscious companies. Figure that out and the whole world will shift.


Lawyers have their place. I can't make the argument that the law isn't important...but it is no coincidence that it's highly unlikely you will ever find a lawyer working in law that has done anything greater than making themselves rich on single small issues.

If you want to change the world be a businessman and solve a problem. Instead of being Holden caufield who just calls everyone phonies, step into the realm of action and address the issues there where the complexities cannot be avoided and your only possibility at success is to have a real solution.

I can't even recommend politics because all environmental laws have done is line the pockets of certain elitists while oppressing people and not solving any problems whatsoever.

You may not like Elon Musk, and there are reasons not to, but you can't deny that his push for the electric car, solar energy and quality battery packs has given the opportunity for mankind to be more environmentally friendly than anything any lawyer or politician has ever done.

Forget fixing problems through oppression. Choose innovation and have faith if people are given an equal choice that they will overwhelmingly choose the environmental option.","2018-08-31 17:43:45","1","Aro2220","1747894647.3960829","carbon footprint","manual"
