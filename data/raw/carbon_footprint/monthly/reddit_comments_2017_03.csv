I think we all need to have our own exit plan for ourselves and our loved ones but it would be in-extremis as an absolute last resort last gasp step only when all hope has been lost and the zombies have made it not only over the barricades but have partially broken in to the last safe room and are now about to bite down (or maybe 2 minutes before that).
