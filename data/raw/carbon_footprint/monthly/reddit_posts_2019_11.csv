"e1f461","climatechange","action-oriented","What do we need to change to stop climate change?","The weather is getting hotter, I'm in California where the seasons are now winter, spring, summer, fall, and fire season, and it's terrifying. Global warming is very real, and climate crisis can't be ignored. The problem I'm finding is the information given to the public tells us about the problem, but doesn't give us a solution? I've been digging through the internet looking for a list of alternative actions people can do instead of the actions that leave a carbon footprint. The articles with headlines saying ""things you can do to stop climate change"", but what I read are suggestions that sound more like holistic health habits than anything to do with climate.

I would say, starting immediately, recycling is mandatory, and we need classes and videos showing us and teaching us what can and cannot be recycled, and how to prep things we will recycle. 

Discontinue use of fossil fuels, there are clean energy fuel alternatives in the works, and soon there will be solar powered cars that charge themselves while you drive: imagine never having to get gas again? I'm waiting for flying cars, but I don't have information on them.

P,lastics have to go, we're already bringing our own bags to grocery stores, we have so many products stored in plastic, it's hard to imagine living without it, but it's come to a point, if we want to live, we have to live without it. There are other materials like glass or ceramic, even cardboard, that would suffice.

These are just a few ideas that would help, I'm trying to get answers and find solutions, I can't stand that this is happening, and I will do everything I can and more to restore the Earth, without the Earth, none of us would exist.

On an added note, I think they should ban guns and any type of firearms in the U.S., no one may own or purchase a gun, they will be assigned strictly to law enforcement and the military. I even have red flags about law enforcement having guns, there have been to many tragic incidents lately of the police shooting innocent people. And I know the NRA would disapprove my suggestion, I would like to talk with them about their policies, since I know nothing about them, and ask them if their children feel safe going to school?

If we make the tasks it takes to reverse climate change trendy, people will catch on, begin a new habit -intentionally, good healthy habits are the coolest things to do, they're at the top of all billboard charts, the headlines on every newspaper, in fact we need to start a global craze of good habits, and have fun cleaning up the Earth, we can restore it to a livable state, and know that we all made a difference.","2019-11-25 12:02:57","0","26","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e1f461/what_do_we_need_to_change_to_stop_climate_change/","True","theeyesthatglow","1747926153.0473459","carbon footprint","manual"

"dw8scf","collapse","skeptical","Corrosion: What Offshore Wind Farms And Nuclear Plants Have In Common","Something different, I'll try to be serious.

When German engineers designed the biggest offshore wind farms on earth, they didn't consider corrosion. They said in their own words that after designing them, they thought they could forget about them. Not only did they not account for hi-speed wind particle corrosion, they also didn't account for stresses the new big wind turbines encounter, especially in a harsher climate. The reason our new urban condos will last only 20-30 years is because of global money investors corrupt regulatory governance.

These big investors prowl the markets for government subsidized national green energy growth partnerships. The biggest investor groups get the biggest contracts, and commit the biggest frauds. Ever since 2008, the frauds and security threats they cause are super exponentiating under all scenarios.

Global investors don't care if the F-35 and Boeing jets won't actually fly. The F-35 undergoes maintenance 10 X more than it flies. This is a feature, not a flaw to investors. Boeing hid training costs to win global investor brownie points. It's the same with the recent announcement of trillions for offshore wind farm factories. Instead of making new ones, they'll be fixing them half the time.

When you mention how many bats and birds turbines kill, defensive cries about bird killing glass towers erupt. Green energy is additive, in killing, as well as total energy use. When dams were built in the 1930s and 40s, they were built to clear city air from coal dust. The coal plants kept growing outside of town and the new hydro dams only added more power to total energy growth.

It's the same with green energy. Wind turbines are made of fiberglass and glue, and when they get pelted by sea dust, they puncture, fracture and flake off into the sea. The fiberglass layers of glue become delaminated inside, meaning the layers weaken and separate from each other. Offshore wind turbines use 1,000 X more copper than land turbines do. Their environmental resource footprint is off the chart. They kill both fish and bird.

These wind farms will be massive, in both breadth and size. After the farms are built, tax payers get stuck with the maintenance costs before global investors sell and move to the next big thing. They did the same thing with GMOs. They don't care if their products kill vertebrates and insects. It's why we have all these nano particles eating our guts and brains. Petrochemicals are turning all male vertebrates female and making us sterile, weaker and stupider. Our jaws are shrinking so fast, that many cannot sleep or live without braces. Our heads don't sit atop our shoulders now, it hangs down between them. These evolutionary changes are happening faster than expected, which is secret code in this sub for, I told ya so.

Getting rich from the next killer app is what it's all about, but personal wealth is a climate killer because the top 20% produce 70% of emissions just from flying and yachting from house to house, toasting the war on climate change. Kids don't think living as something more than human is 100 year old propaganda. This whole explosion of wealth and knowledge happened in 100 years. The old rich super powerful are the sons and daughters of the old new rich. The commies and monarchists have been fighting 100 years. 100 years is 1 human lifetime.

The robber barons of 100 years ago are the global investors today. They use political assassins and media puppets to secure returns on investment. They piggyback and corrupt every facet of your life. We could legalize drugs and healthcare next week, but we're too stuck in the past 100 years, and we got 10 years to cut carbon 50%. Offshore wind farms stop delivering half their actual power in about 12 years, when their actual power is about 10% of proclaimed power. If the sticker says 100 megawatts you get 10 megawatts. This simple math is called the collapse of civilization, but there's more to it than that, collapse is more inter-sectional than all the mix-matched socks in my drawer.

These offshore wind farms are facing particle and wind extremes that are heading off the charts. The engineers didn't account for stress and wear as we are or as it is, never mind as it will be going forward. The biggest component of green investing are natural gas owners. Oil was never important as coal, but because petrochemical use grows 7 X faster than humans reproduce, it will be more important than coal ever was going forward. Natural gas owners are behind all this. By 2030, more oil will be used to make stuff than will be used to run 2 billion cars.

When economists or engineers tell you that we can get X number of green power by Y date, they are feeding you a complete line of bullshit. Green energy is the most corrupt business there is because the energy promised is 10 X less than the energy you get on a global energy scale. It's the declining material energy throughput return on investment.
