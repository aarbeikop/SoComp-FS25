My wife basically told me to stop whining and do something about it. LOL. She's right, of course. But what can I really do?

We can try to conserve energy and waste less food and water. However, the very fact that we live in a house in the suburbs makes us automatically use more resources than others. 

I thought, well maybe I'll sell the house and live in a smaller apartment. But then someone else would be living in the house and using as much, if not more, resources. 

I bought an electric car last year. I needed a new car. My old car had 160,000 miles on it and was strating to cost a fortune in maintenance. So I bought the electric car. I guess it's better than buying an ICE car, but the mere act of buying a new car increased my carbon footprint.

I want to do something. However, I don't want to be the only one making great personal sacrifices. Most won't make the changes necessary on their own. Therefore, one person choosing to live sustainably really won't make much of a difference.

If the whole world is going up in flames anyway, I might as well enjoy the time I have.

The problem is so big that only massive government intervention can solve it. However, that doesn't seem remotely likely in at least the near future.

Do I just cross my fingers and hope for the best? Is voting for the right politicians the answer?

Do your bit for the environment and eat bacon and steaks, burgers and pork chops.

By eating those cows and pigs, you're reducing their numbers and doing good for the environment.

Vegans are terrible - by not eating meat, they're increasing the carbon footprint of all those animals.          
We need to educate Vegans - they're destroying the planet!","2018-10-09 09:46:35","0","6","0.37","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9mnrtx/save_the_planet_one_bite_at_a_time/","True","SarahC","1747901118.874843","carbon footprint","manual"
