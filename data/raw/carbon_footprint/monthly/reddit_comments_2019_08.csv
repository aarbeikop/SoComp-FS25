What it would take to wipe out literally every single individual would have to be something truly catastrophic. People always seem to forget that nuclear war is still a thing that could possibly happen or antibiotic resistant superbugs that have no known treatment. Even farther than that there are countless asteroids that have every chance in the known universe to be on a collision course with Earth, and yet we made it this far. Humans are adaptable and we will adapt to the conflicts that are coming. Not everyone will be able to and richer countries and individuals surely have an upper hand in this but humanity won’t go extinct","2019-08-16 14:18:50","11","Harpo1999","1747922091.696088","carbon footprint","manual"

"ex2x0jy","t3_cr6wnf","cr6wnf","climatechange","action-oriented","I can understand thinking that people are avoiding sad truths - and I think some people are, considering that there [ARE terrible things in our future](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/) [whether or not we kick our butts in gear](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/how-think-about-dire-new-ipcc-climate-report/595705/) \- but there's a **big** difference between catastrophe and extinction. Rapid collapse of civilization is another matter, but that's still a possibility, [not a certainty](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/13/18660548/climate-change-human-civilization-existential-risk). The climate crisis is more nuanced than [""Welp, we're effed"".](https://twitter.com/DrKateMarvel/status/1135637164467863553)

So, realistically, we stand at a point where we're able to slow down warming, but probably not stop it. It's very likely [we'll be passing through certain temperature thresholds](https://climatetippingpoints.info/2019/04/15/fact-check-do-tipping-points-and-feedbacks-commit-us-to-rapid-catastrophic-warming/) like 1.5 and 2 Degrees - and the regional conflicts and food/water crises that'll come with that increased chaos - but the more we do to reduce our emissions, the easier it'll be to adapt to our changed world. If we end up at 1.8 Degrees, that's better than being over 2 Degrees, and if we end up at 2.3, that's better than 2.5 Degrees. How bad our situation is depends on how high our temperatures go, and the lower we can keep that number, the better we'll be.

You're right that for us to fix this, we have to do a heck of a lot, [and there's every possibility that we're going to fail](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/pa9vg8/climate-change-edgelords-are-the-new-climate-change-deniers). And you're right, we've barely done anything to even address the climate crisis. But it's 2019, and we actually have [climate change in the political discussion for next election](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/14/18662697/climate-change-2019-democratic-debates) (as sad as it is compared to other issues). [We have activists that got a major western power to start a climate assembly through civil disobedience](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/20/uk-citizens-assembly-on-climate-emergency-announced) \- weak as it might be right now - and it doesn't look like they're letting the UK stop there. As flawed as it might be, [we have a politician in the United States talking about a green economic revolution that's in the mainstream conversation.](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/aocgreen-new-deal-new-era-millennial-climate-politics/582295/)

"ex29vhj","t3_cr6wnf","cr6wnf","climatechange","action-oriented","I think 20 years ago they were focused on ""the end of civilization as we know it"" if all fossil fuel use wasn't fixed by now.  So, not human extinction, but the end of civilization.  Now, we only have a few months left to stave off actual extinction.  By 2030, we'll only have a decade left before Global Warming destroys the entire solar system.","2019-08-16 14:24:50","1","deck_hand","1747922091.708035","carbon footprint","manual"
"ex5vi6l","t3_cr6wnf","cr6wnf","climatechange","action-oriented","I think that despite the numbers, we're still figuring out things as we go. Numbers account for trends but humans are kinda unpredictable. What we do today, tomorrow, or 10 years from now could impact those numbers. That's why I take it with a bit of a grain of salt. Climate Change is still massively important but we won't know what happens until it does.","2019-08-17 09:09:34","1","[deleted]","1747922091.709816","carbon footprint","manual"

I see people talking about ""lowering emissions"", which would've been great 30 years ago when atmospheric CO2 was at safe levels, but now we're way past that. 

On top of that, no country aside from Bhutan is anywhere near carbon neutrality. And we don't have the means of the motive to be like Bhutan. We're resoundingly failing our paris agreement goals. We have politicians who still believe the problem doesn't exist.

It would be interesting to see how much carbon an acre of forest could trap compared to an acre of empress trees.","2019-08-09 15:31:39","1","[deleted]","1747922168.953703","carbon footprint","manual"
