"aiy61m","collapse","skeptical","Don’t know how to live, conflicted between switching to a “green” lifestyle and carrying on as usual.","Hi everybody, so I’m interested in hearing how you’ve changed (or haven’t changed) your lifestyles after learning of ecological collapse.  

We know that the first world luxuries of cars, flying, meat, plastic-packaged goods etc are wreaking havoc on our biosphere, and even if individual carbon footprints are a drop in the ocean compared to what corporations emit, part of me still feels that we should at least do what we can, and do the right thing just because it’s the right thing to do, even if it doesn’t result in the desired outcome. Individuals collectively thinking that since their actions won’t make a difference, they might as well live however they want, do whatever they want, surely contributes to the problem, no? Aren’t we morally obligated to minimise the harm we do? 

HOWEVER, part of me also feels that it’s too late, that the momentum of our industrial/capitalist/consumerist society is too strong to stop and there’s nothing that can be done about it. The wheels will keep turning until we find ourselves hurtling off the cliff into the fiery pits of a collapsed hellworld. If that’s the case, then why not enjoy all the conveniences and luxuries this sinking ship has to offer while we can? Why not travel to different countries while air travel is still accessible, why not enjoy hot baths, why not eat plastic-packaged, imported chocolate? Why not live in comfort while it’s still available?

I’m finding it difficult to reconcile these two conflicting mindsets. 

After coming across this sub, my initial reaction was depression. Then I decided to turn that depression into fuel for action. I wanted to believe there was hope for the future. I decided to overhaul my entire lifestyle as much as was feasible. I went vegan. I decided to commit to minimalism, zero waste, anti-consumption, sustainability.  I decided to live car-free and not have children. But with the exception of having children, I have to admit that it’s been hard to keep my resolve for all the other things, when hope seems to become more of a foolish illusion with each day that passes. Going for drives is something that helps me cope, but it gives me cognitive dissonance because I know I’m being part of the problem in choosing to drive. I imagine it’s what a Christian must feel like when they have sex before marriage. 

In closing, I’m filled with despair and I just really don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I just want to kill myself. To get out of my own head, I thought I’d try and seek some wisdom from the good folk over here. I’m curious to hear how other collapse-aware people have decided to live their lives.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the replies everyone. I have read through them all and it seems there’s many different paths you can take when aware of collapse. I’m still lost as to how I should live my life but reading your replies was still comforting nonetheless, and gave me some perspective. I hope I’ll be able to find a path that will give me peace soon. Much love.

"airl7n","sustainability","action-oriented","Eating Vegetarian","With more and more evidence about meat's carbon footprint coming into public consciousness, I thought it could be useful to discuss some general principles for eating vegetarian. If it's something you have never done before, it can be quite daunting, but it's totally possible (and delicious).

If you're switching to being vegetarian, you can't just cut meat out of your normal meals and expect things to go well. There is nutrition that your body needs that you are getting from meat, so you'll need to look at your diet as a whole.

The primary nutrition coming from meat is protein, but luckily, protein is everywhere in the plant world as well! Cultures all over the world combine beans and grains to get a flavorful delivery of protein (and carbohydrates) they need in their diets. Quinoa is an interesting grain because it is high in protein and carbohydrates all in one package. Nuts can also be another great source of protein. Eggs and dairy can be good, but they also have serious carbon footprint problems, so minimizing their place in your diet is advisable.

Processed plant proteins in fake meat products are also a meat replacement option. These often still have a rather large carbon footprint, and if you read the ingredients of many brands you'll find they often contain things you don't want to eat regularly. While I do enjoy a veggie burger, I've found that my favorite meals don't replace meat with fake meats, but are designed to be vegetarian in the first place.

Iron is another nutritional component that meat provides, but it is also easy to get other ways. Many foods you may not expect have plenty of iron. Leafy greens are a fantastic source and go well with almost anything, especially on the side. Raisins are also good, and easy to cook with or just munch on as a snack. Not all iron has to come directly from our food though. Cooking in cast iron introduces a good amount of iron to the food cooked in it.

Omega 3s are one of the hardest things to come by without eating meat. They typically come from fish, and eggs, but if you're cutting those out, your next best bet is flax seeds. Make sure you break the casing of the seeds (mash, chop, blend, chew really well, or heat till they crack), otherwise they don't always digest and may pass right through without any of their goodness getting into your body.

There are a ton of side benefits of eating vegetarian. Your kitchen doesn't have a constant influx of bacteria that live in animals so sanitation is less crucial. Vegetables are largely water, so you can often eat more without gaining weight. The fiber in your diet will probably increase, generally helping digestion and reducing risks for cancer. Plant based fats are not as bad for your cholesterol. Generally, you end up more aware of what you are putting in your body and how it impacts you.

As a lifelong vegetarian raised in the south, I've had plenty of practice trying to eat vegetarian in a culture that is unsupportive, and even hostile at times. There are challenges, but it's getting easier all the time, and the more people do it, the easier it will get.

Please share your own tips and findings to help anyone thinking of reducing the meat in their diet.
