"7n109n","collapse","skeptical","Why young Europeans people should have more children to address climate change","You often hear the argument proposed that having children leads to a dramatic carbon footprint and thus destructive ecological consequences, as this ensures the global population keeps rising and us first world citizens tend to emit more carbon dioxide than poor people in India or in Africa.

I reject this theory and propose instead that young Europeans have a moral obligation to have more children. The reason for this is because there is just one chance we have to avoid a global catastrophe: Innovation. At this point, only radical cultural and technological innovation can prevent a global catastrophe.

Imagine you're sitting in a boat that's slowly sinking due to damage to the hull. There are nine passengers and one mechanic, who knows how to repair the hull and pump out water. The ship might float slightly longer if the mechanic chose to drown himself, but this would merely delay the catastrophe that faces the other passengers. The only chance you have is for the mechanic to fix the ship.

Now imagine our planet. Imagine all of the wealthy white people in the world decided to kill themselves today. At first the people of the world would celebrate, but soon they would figure out that this does not solve their problem. They will now have to solve their problems for themselves, without the help of those who have the skills needed to address our crisis.

Here are a few things I want you to ponder: Who is paying Brazilians not to chop down their rainforest? Could it be the Qatari oil sheikhs? Could it be the Liberians? No, the [Norwegians](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/22/norway-issues-1bn-threat-brazil-rising-amazon-destruction) are using their wealth to prevent deforestation in Brazil. Saudi Arabia on the other hand, spends more than 87 times that amount of money, on exporting Islamic fundamentalism around the world.

Here are a few other questions I want you to ponder: Who is building carbon sequestration plants in Iceland? Who is investing money to grow seaweed in the ocean? Who developed electrical vehicles, who developed solar panels? Who invented the term vegan? Who invented carbon-negative cement? Who is developing lab-grown meat? 

If fifty years ago, upper-middle class white people decided that they should try to address climate change by not having children, the world would be a very different place. We would have no Bill Gates, no Ted Turner, no Warren Buffet, no Elon Musk and no Peter Thiel. The consequence would merely be that we would have even less of a chance of addressing climate change.

Don't get me wrong, the world certainly suffers from overpopulation. However, the focus should lie on reducing births in places where people are unable to live happy meaningful lives that deliver a broader contribution to society. I am all in favor of smaller families in Yemen, Somalia, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria, Congo, India, Bangladesh and other overpopulated third world countries.

This is in everyone's best interest. The carbon footprint of Indians or Liberians might be low, but this is merely a result of the poverty they live in, not the result of some accomplishment they've made. The low carbon footprint lives we pursue are not a goal in themselves, they're part of an attempt to preserve the ability to live happy meaningful lives on planet Earth. If Congo chops down its rainforests or Liberia eradicates every animal larger than a rat from its rainforest to feed its hungry people, they might still have a low carbon footprint, but their actions are still extremely environmentally destructive.

If I have to make a wish for 2018, I will wish for just one thing: More upper-middle class secular college educated suburban white heterosexuals. Reverse your vasectomy, fly to Greece to rejuvenate your ovaries, throw your condoms in the garbage bin and raise a large family.","2017-12-30 10:54:08","0","33","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/7n109n/why_young_europeans_people_should_have_more/","True","moresourdough","1747882988.114146","carbon footprint","manual"
