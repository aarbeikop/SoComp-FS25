Bjorn Lomborg's quote from his recent NYP editorial (recently posted in this forum) seems to apply here. 

The atmospheric-CO2 challenge that civilization faces doesn't involve making simple changes to everyone's lifestyle. People should be encouraged to pursue the lifestyle they want. At the level of individual lifestyles, every bit does not count. Virtually all of those bits are negligible from the perspective of the global climate. 

Instead the task is to stabilize the global load of atmospheric carbon within some optimized range. This task doesn't depend on any individual's personal consumption habits; it's a problem that can only be addressed at industrial scale. Solutions will depend on:

1) Modeling all significant sources of emissions 

2) Identifying the optimal range of atmospheric CO2 (and possibly other GHGs)

3) Controlling net emissions that cause the atmospheric level to exceed the top of the optimal range.

4) Sequestering excess CO2/GHGs, but not so intensely that the atmospheric level declines below the bottom of the optimal range.

None of these tasks is simple. In fact they're all incredibly complex, and will require the efforts of thousands of people over decades of work. We've hardly even begun work beyond task #1, and there's no reason to expect measurable progress for years in the future. 

So the best thing to do is to choose the lifestyle you want, and to help other people reach their goals as well. Climate change will follow a path — over decades and maybe centuries — determined by many factors much larger and more influential than your individual lifestyle.

I'm not sure of the wood to charcoal process. However, coal is turned into coke, ie relatively pure carbon, (same as charcoal) by heating coal in a oxygen free oven. After some time the byproducts have flowed out of the coal and left only carbon (called coke). The hot coke is removed from the oxygen free oven and quickly quenched with water.

This proces requires a lot of heat from an external source. ","2018-11-03 23:18:38","1","NewyBluey","1747902271.237379","carbon footprint","manual"
