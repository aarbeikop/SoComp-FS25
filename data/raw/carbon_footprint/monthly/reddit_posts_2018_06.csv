"8rpnj3","collapse","skeptical","Why climate change was never addressed","The main reason climate change was never addressed, is because it became a partisan issue. The right wing chose not to acknowledge the issue. On the left side of the spectrum, another mentality emerged. Climate change became political cannon fodder, to implement policies that already fit within a progressive agenda.

Consider a few policies that help to address climate change, that never became part of the progressive agenda. Consider a problem pointed out by Democratic senator Gaylord Nelson, who began Earth Day. Mass immigration to Western nations makes it very difficult for us to transition to a sustainable economic system. In his autobiography from 2002, Nelson wrote:

>In order to bring a halt to exponential growth, the number of legal immigrants entering this country would have to match the number of emigrants leaving it – about 220,000 people per year. Yet, while federal actions have increased the immigration rate dramatically during the last four decades, any suggestion that the rate be decreased to some previously acceptable level is met with charges of ""nativism,"" ""racism,"" and the like. Unfortunately, such opposition has silenced much-needed discussion of the issue – recalling the smear tactics of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy. The first time around it was ""soft on communism."" This time the charge is ""racism,"" because a significant number of immigrants are of Hispanic descent. Demagogic rhetoric of this sort has succeeded in silencing the environmental and academic communities and has tainted any discussion of population and immigration issues as ""politically incorrect."" As frustrating as it is to see the president and members of Congress running for cover on such a monumental issue, it is nothing short of astonishing to see the great American free press, with its raft of syndicated columnists, frightened into silence by political correctness.

When an immigrant moves to the United States, his carbon footprint is [quadrupled](https://cis.org/Immigration-United-States-and-WorldWide-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-0) on average. Without immigration, the United States' carbon emissions would have been in decline in recent years, as per capita emissions are in decline. There's another issue that never became part of the progressive agenda to address climate change. Whenever you point it out, it makes people deeply uncomfortable. John Michael Greer explains the issue [here:](https://worldnewstrust.com/climate-change-activism-a-post-mortem-john-michael-greer)

>I’d like to suggest a thought experiment here, to show just how the costs and benefits offered by the climate change movement stacked up. Let’s imagine, for a moment, that there’s an industry in today’s industrial nations that churns out colossal amounts of greenhouse gases every single day. It doesn’t produce anything necessary for human life or well-being; it’s simply a convenience, and one that, not that many decades ago, most people in the industrial world did without and never thought they’d need. If it were to be shut down, sure, a certain number of people would lose their jobs, but most of the steps that have been urged by climate change activists would have that effect; other than that, and a certain amount of inconvenience for its current users, the only result would be a sharp decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide and certain other greenhouse gases being dumped into the atmosphere. That being the case, shouldn’t climate change activists get to work right now to shut down that industry, and shouldn’t they start off by boycotting it themselves?

>The industry in question actually exists. It’s the commercial air travel industry.

>You may have noticed, dear reader, that nobody in the climate change movement has been out there protesting commercial air travel, and precious few of them are even willing to cut back on their flying time, even though commercial air travel a massive contributor to the problems the movement claims to be fighting. I know of two scientists researching climate change who have pointed out that there’s something just a little bit hypocritical about flying all over the world on jetliners to attend conferences discussing how we all have to decrease our carbon footprint! Their colleagues, needless to say, haven’t listened. Neither has the rest of the climate change movement; like Al Gore, who might as well be their poster child, they keep on racking up their frequent flyer miles.

>On the other hand, climate change activists are eager to shut down coal mining. What’s the most significant difference between coal mining and commercial air travel? Coal mining provides wages for the working poor; commercial air travel provides amenities for the affluent.

>The difference isn’t accidental, either. Across the board, the climate change movement has pushed for changes that will penalize people in what I’ve called the wage class, the majority of Americans who depend on an hourly wage for their income. The movement has gone out of its way to avoid pushing for changes that will penalize people in what I’ve called the salary class, the affluent minority of Americans who bring home a monthly salary. That isn’t a minor point. There’s the hard fact that, on average, the more money you make, the bigger your carbon footprint is -- but there’s also a political issue, and it goes to the heart of the failure of the climate change movement.

>I’ve had any number of well-meaning climate change activists ask me, in tones of baffled despair, why they can’t get ordinary Americans to take climate change seriously. My answer is not one they want to hear, because I tell them that it’s because well-meaning climate change activists don’t take climate change seriously. If you don’t care enough about the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere to accept some inconveniences to your own lifestyle, how much do you actually care about it? That’s the kind of logic that ordinary Americans use all the time to judge whether someone is serious about a cause or simply grandstanding, and by and large, climate change activism fails that sniff test.

Climate change and environmentalism have been assimilated into a broader progressive agenda, that effectively exclude people outside of the traditional progressive demographic. Consider the simple fact that a right-wing environmentalist movement once existed. It was taken over by progressives. Here's an example of a scenario that happened across the Western world:

>Rednecks for wilderness was one of the first slogans about Earth First! I heard in the late 80’s when I got involved and began attending Earth First! meetings (I still attend once a week). This was the period when EF! was a threat to the system. Earth First! was on 60 Minutes–and we really looked like a mass movement about to burst from the confines of control to create social change. There are a lot more rednecks than transsexuals in America, they are, as they say, a larger demographic, and this was reflected in the numbers in our movement. The journal during this period had 10 times to subscribers it has today.

>It was in the late 80’s and 90’s that I saw the systematic driving away of rednecks from EF! circles by largely young white middle class “anarchist”. I remember at one Round River Rendezvous in Colorado this good ole boy stood up and thanked everyone for coming to the great state of Colorado, expressing pride in his home state. Immediately he was publically attacked by the black clads for expressing pride in any state. I watched him sit down and realized he would never come back. As a young white person who subscribed to many anarchist ideals I couldn’t help noticing the irony of this trend. Classical anarchists embraced the working class–the neo-anarchists in our movement drove them out.

>I find it curious that now that while EF! has become largely white middle class, so many efforts are being made to protect and nurture a tiny subgroup of society–while completely ignoring how a much larger demographic has been driven out. Basically the white middle class drove out the poor working country class from our movement. We have fractured along class lines with devastating results. Who is more likely to know how to take apart a CAT dozer? A good ole boy who can field strip a 1970 Ford Engine in his sleep? Or an alienated suburban product of the white middle class? And now we appear to be appealing to an even smaller sub sect of society while ignoring the larger class which originally made EF! so dangerous.

Finally, there's another big problem we encounter, which is that progressives have a de facto policy of no enemies on the left. They even maintain this policy, when leftist politicians complete dismiss climate change and refuse to implement steps to address it. Progressive leaders can get away with destroying our environment, when they pay lip service to gay marriage and feminism. [Consider the example of Justin Trudeau:](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/29/justin-trudeau-world-newest-oil-executive-kinder-morgan)

>Trudeau told oil executives last year that “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there”. That’s apparently how much he plans to dig up and burn – and if he’s successful, the one half of 1% of the planet that is Canadian will have awarded to itself almost one-third of the remaining carbon budget between us and the 1.5 degree rise in temperature the planet drew as a red line in Paris.

So here we have Justin Trudeau planning a climatic catastrophe on a scope equivalent to that of Donald Trump. But how many progressives are able to spare some of the rage they have towards Donald Trump, for Justin Trudeau? None of them seem able to. You might say this is not relevant, but if your political opposition notices that climate change is dismissed when it comes to progressive politicians but emphasized when it comes to conservative politicians, your opposition will simply dig themselves into their trenches and stick their fingers into their ears. If you want climate change to become a bipartisan issue, politicians on the left need to be held accountable. In practice, this is simply not what happens.

Finally, there's another big problem I notice, which is that people refuse to act on what they preach. The issue overwhelmingly tends to be relegated to the government, who will have to come up with some sort of solution, that involves somehow building a functional electricity grid using intermittent renewable production. However, governments are unable to implement any sort of limits to people's wasteful expense of fossil fuels, because nobody seems willing to voluntarily implement reductions to their own carbon budgets. 

How many hip young avocado-smoothy sipping millennials can you think of who canceled their voluntourism in Africa after figuring out the associated carbon budget and donated the cost of their airline ticket to a family planning charity instead? I can't think of any. When governments notice no genuine support from the demographic they would need core support from, they can not implement policies that address climate change. Here's what John Michael Greer [has to say about it:](https://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/18748.html)

>It's really quite simple. Imagine, dear reader, that instead of talking about stopping climate change, we were talking about stopping rape. Imagine that there were big organizations dedicated to stopping rape, and curiously enough, most of their membership consisted of serial rapists. Imagine, then, that people pointed out to the serial rapists that if they really wanted to stop rape, they ought to start by not committing any more rapes themselves -- and every time, the serial rapists responded by insisting that you can't stop rape by just having the members of anti-rape organizations give up raping people, that the problem's much bigger than that, and how can they find a way to communicate to everyone in the world that rape is wrong? The answer, of course, is that they can't, because nobody will take them seriously until they themselves stop committing rape. 

>Climate change activism these days is almost entirely a concern of middle- and upper middle-class people in the industrial world: people, that is, whose lifestyles are disproportionately responsible for the dumping of greenhouse gases; people who use much more fossil fuel energy, and many more of the products of fossil fuel energy, than the average human being. This fact isn't lost on anybody outside the climate change movement -- and the fact that climate change activists by and large insist on leading carbon-intensive lifestyles, while insisting that everyone else has to do something about climate change, has done more to scuttle the movement to stop climate change than any other factor I can think of. Unless something changes fast -- and by ""something"" I mean the attitudes of those who aren't willing to draw the obvious connection between the problems they think they're fighting and the lifestyles to which they think they're entitled -- the deindustrial future I described in my novel Star's Reach is looking more likely every day.
