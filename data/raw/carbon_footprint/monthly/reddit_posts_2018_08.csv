"96uyks","climate","scientific","Sustainable personal carbon footprint level?","As an individual concerned about the changing climate, I would like to take steps to reduce my personal carbon emissions.

I used a carbon footprint calculator which projected my annual carbon footprint to be 36,316 Lbs Of CO2e.

The U.S. average was listed at 63,934 Lbs Of CO2e.

Does this mean I do not need to change anything and that I am good to go?

What should be a target goal for an individual U.S. citizen who would like to be responsible?","2018-08-13 03:25:24","2","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/96uyks/sustainable_personal_carbon_footprint_level/","True","JimEngland","1747894147.453556","carbon footprint","manual"
"93tm5r","collapse","skeptical","Can we stop glorifying travel yet?","I’m a wildlife biologist and one of my biggest pet peeves is the instagram “travel” culture in the United States (and I assume other industrial nations) today. My conservation scientist friends and colleagues appear to see no hypocrisy with a career dedicated to saving the planet, yet vacation in New Zealand or Africa, constant travel for work and conferences, and full on consumerist lifestyle. 

I accept that society is collapsing. My fear is that life on earth will be impossible by 2100. How do we shift our social norms to put pressure on travel and consumerism? Social pressure is the most powerful way to change behaviors, not with the righteousness of bleeding heart liberalism but more along the lines of unspoken social norms. 

At this point our situation is so severe that we need to stop traveling and start growing food in every backyard and lawn possible using permaculture techniques of composting and rebuilding soils. The carbon footprint of wildlife research, along with other sciences, is truly insane. 

It’s passed time that we change the way we live! Especially people who are very aware of the problems, have the means to change, but there is no social pressure to do so.

"9bog1r","collapse","skeptical","I'm sorry to say it, but I'm losing hope.","I spend much of my spare time picking up trash in the area where I live. I am of voting age and will play how I can in that imperfect system to help the environment. I can speak confidently, and plan to study law to become an environmental lawyer, pipe dream that may be. I urge my friends to reduce their waste and carbon footprints. I will join protests and donate and volunteer and do all I can for the Earth we live on but it feels like a lost cause. Every increasingly intense summer holds new records showing our quickly collapsing environment, and new records for the rates at which we kill it. 

My country doesn't care, and even the nations that do aren't doing enough to slow those that don't. Most people don't care. They drift from shift to shift in pursuit of money, or pleasing, stable jobs (where they don't have to worry about a thing amidst this slow burning apocalypse.) Their human desires cause waste, pollution, destruction. Many of them view the environment as ""political"" and wouldn't like to be bothered about that either. Many of them never give it any mind. 

It feels like too many are like this, and those that care are doing too little, too late. I'm not going to give up my goals and ambitions, but I can't shake this depressing feeling.","2018-08-30 23:18:29","67","61","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9bog1r/im_sorry_to_say_it_but_im_losing_hope/","True","HyrulianPessimist","1747894643.4507022","carbon footprint","manual"
