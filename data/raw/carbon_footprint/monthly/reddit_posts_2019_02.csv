I have a chronic Illness that will inevitably get worse over time. So while I know it is no guarantee that they will take care of me to some extent, should I have them? Almost as a $1,000,000 insurance policy.

I am 31, I will unlikely be able to retire, mostly because my savings plan is minimal and also, climate change. It is changing. Fast. And humans are going nowhere. Fast.

So, do I invest in children (probably only one) as my future, or savings?

I am at a loss. Any advice would be helpful a

Thanks in advance.","2019-02-08 12:05:19","1","10","0.55","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/aofvsv/kids/","True","SeatBackForward","1747907808.449971","carbon footprint","manual"
"anxfge","collapse","skeptical","Can we change the one thing that is most important: human nature?","Maybe we will initiate a carbon tax, geo-engineer a stable climate, even clean up the oceans, but can we ever change the greedy, selfish ways of our species? 

I don’t think we were always like this. I think there are times when our best qualities shine and we care about our fellow humans and non-human creatures. I think when we are connected in small communities, we take care of each other and similarly, when we are connected to nature, we take care of it. The trend however is disconnection. 

Just like in medicine, we treat the symptoms and not the root cause, my fear is that we are able to tackle some of these issues, say we stabilize the climate, and we end up enabling our species to continue decimating all life on earth that we don’t absolutely need for our survival. 

The most frustrating arguments I’ve had with people is when I try to argue that we should sacrifice progress for other species. Species that aren’t endangered or particularly useful to society... just regular animals and plants. Just for their own sake. To say we shouldn’t build more houses in an empty field, is just ludicrous to people. “What you care more about mice and raccoons than PEOPLE??” 

Is there anyway to change the culture? Education? Some systemic structuring that makes people better? 

All the solutions and “great” ideas for saving the planet is just nails on the chalkboard to me. “We can boost gdp by enacting a carbon tax!” I want to hear people screaming about anti consumerism, anti progress, scaling back our human footprint in every way.

"apefff","sustainability","action-oriented","What are we really trying to keep sustainable?","Hey guys, 

Off late, I feel uneasy and disillusioned when I question about sustainability in the following way: 

It is clear that thinking of sustainability just through the lens of emission targets is narrow, as meeting those targets only corrects the carbon imbalance but leaves other issues on the table.  In that regard ecological footprint metric is more comprehensive. But again if we attain ecological balance from a resource consumption perspective, will we truly attain the harmony in living with nature.  Also what qualities or aspects of Nature we want to preserve through our sustainable actions? I don’t intend to be philosophical, but trying  to get a glimpse of the end of this tunnel.
