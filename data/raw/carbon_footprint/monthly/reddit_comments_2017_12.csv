2: westerners aren't just the big carbon emitters, we are also the main cause of world overpopulation and environmental destruction in the first place
3: westerners, like everyone else, have demonstrated an inability to control our tendency to overconsume, and I see no reason to think that will change, based on what I see.","2017-12-30 11:13:28","16","ontrack","1747882990.054688","carbon footprint","manual"

How about instead of hoping some white kid grows up to be a genius inventor, you could just maybe eat less meat and get involved in environmental activism? That sure as shit will do more for our future than hoping for a miracle.","2017-12-30 12:32:19","6","Katerena","1747882990.0650098","carbon footprint","manual"

Listen man. 

I know you think it's an option, and I'm sure white supremacy sounds appealing on some level to you, but if you want to see how it really plays out, look at the American South where a majority of white people have large families. Often, they're in poverty. 

If you want to have a large family, there's --plenty-- of orphaned kids who would love to have you as a parent. Plenty. You can make a dynasty out of love with them. 

But make no mistake. The rich are already the rich and fight among themselves to be at the top of the corpse pile. They don't want any more competition, especially from poor people like you and I. ","2017-12-31 03:07:01","4","some_random_kaluna","1747882990.0709262","carbon footprint","manual"

Wouldn't it make sense to focus our energies on support of the third world with a very basic standard of living, and free education? It's seems that this would be a guarantee of reduced suffering both today, and in the future, and increase the chances of green innovation.
