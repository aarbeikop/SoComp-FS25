"aal867","climatechange","action-oriented","How could new technologies combat global warming by identifying the carbon footprint of individual consumers and how valuable would this insight be?","The other day I was having a discussion with some family members during our Christmas dinner if an interface to monitor your own carbon footprint would be a feasible concept.

What it came down to is that with all the available data sources and smart algorithms, it does seem likely that it is possible to deduct information from data and identify the carbon footprint of the individual.

What if this concept would provide a foundation for synergies between corporate/governmental institutions and the individual consumer in our quest to fight global warming?","2018-12-29 13:31:11","13","9","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/aal867/how_could_new_technologies_combat_global_warming/","True","HqHu","1747903845.9033878","carbon footprint","manual"
"aaab2d","climate","scientific","Idea: How insight in my own Carbon Footprint could lead to a better world","I recently had a discussion with family members during our Christmas dinner regarding global warming and how each of us as individual (whether we want it or not) contributes to the whole issue. What we concluded is that without insight into our own carbon footprints (as an estimator of environmental impact of the individual), it is hard for a willing individual to make (daily) responsible decisions that limit the extend to which these contribute to global warming.

&#x200B;

What would be the gains of such insight in your own carbon footprint:

By gaining insight into how my daily decisions (e.g. consumer behaviour when buying groceries, buying environmentally friendly clothing, ride my bike rather than drive my car) affect my carbon footprint, I think I'll become more aware and stimulated to gradually reduce my footprint over time. Additionally, I could see synergies between corporate & governmental institutions as this would open up incentives for promoting environmentally friendly behaviour (e.g. reduction in taxes, promoting the use of alternative transportation to the office).

&#x200B;

So here is my idea and (roughly) how it would work:

The idea is to create an product/service that gives the individual insight in his/her carbon footprint. This service would be based on an ever increasing database infrastructure, as the IoT gives us more and more data to draw conclusions from (maybe blockchain provides a solution for data reliability & validity here). The service/product would measure and calculate the carbon footprint based on various data sources (e.g. consumer behaviour deducted from payment data, fuel consumption from data generated by our cars etc.). By measuring the footprint, the individual would be presented with an overview, which could then be broken down for further analysis by the tools provided within the service (e.g. are there any specific products I buy, that significantly increase my footprint and should I consider alternatives?). After analysing the root causes (yes this is inspired by the continuous improvement philosophy) of your footprint, you would then be able to define ways on how to improve. Lastly the control step would be something that could integrate some sort of reward structure, to make sure individuals are rewarded adequately for good behaviour.

&#x200B;

What would be the business model:

I'd say we make this available for individuals for free, but charge (monthly/yearly) licensing costs for corporate & government institutions that are forced to invest in incentives that combat climate change. Also, by providing an option to analyse demographic information on carbon footprints these institutions could define targets for improvement (e.g. we want each individual in our workforce to have a maximum footprint of x kg of CO2 / year, or, we want to reduce the carbon footprint of our overall society by x% by 2025).

&#x200B;

So what's next:

As you might have concluded from the above, I have little to zero experience in software engineering, algorithms, cryptography and whatsoever. But what I do have is a background in industrial engineering & strategy. I hope that I have triggered some of you with this rough conceptual idea, and that we can get in touch someway, as I hope to further investigate if (co-)developing something like this is possible, or if any other parties are already working on similar initiatives.

I have heard great stories of open source development, and maybe this is something that can be developed together by using online team environment such as Slack.

Personally I think this concept could impact the world for the better, but that it will be challenging to develop. Nevertheless I hope that I have sparked some interest and I'm looking forward to get in touch with anyone who has ideas on how to further think this through.","2018-12-28 13:28:35","1","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/aaab2d/idea_how_insight_in_my_own_carbon_footprint_could/","True","HqHu","1747904312.499653","carbon footprint","manual"

"a3smcd","collapse","skeptical","Humanity and other progressive myths","When I hear someone blame humanity for the world's troubles, I often have to take a second look to whom we are referring. Considering The Silence of Animals by John Gray, the myths of progress are destroyed when that which allows them to manifest (civilization) breaks down. Those in war torn Naples did what they needed to in order to survive, going so far as to eat dogs and rats, and tearing apart any metal to repurpose it elsewhere; all without wondering what technology would be like one day. They were returned, painfully, to the primary reality. 

War itself is an inability to empathize with one's enemy due to a perceived superiority or valuing a people's resources more than the people that control it. World war II seemed like two visions of the future coming to a head between the most powerful groups on Earth, while those without such awe-inspiring industrial might were largely enveloped, murdered, or allied by more powerful groups. Still, as we have seen after the last great war, groups can become so powerful as to control citizens outright without the need for an invasion.

 The myths of debt and wealth have become cultural norms, especially in the west, where money allows one to more easily develop in-group/out-group modes of thought. This allows for the dehumanization of not only those who one would rather not associate with because of sexism/racism/homophobia/political bias etc, but also to entirely dehumanize those in other countries caught in the same trap. These outsourced proles work in dangerous conditions (cell-phone makers get cancer significantly more than other prole workers in China), for little pay, and with little choice.

 Yet still the United States is able to demonize China as a whole for their influence, to dehumanize mothers sheltering children from tear gas, and to ignore family separation within its own borders. The largest news topics are considered boring and not discussed, except for the mass shootings (which require mass dehumanization of one's peers, in order to inflict on them the pain one has accumulated and blamed on their community), which allows the myth of progress to continue.

 Yes, things are bad, but just wait! Unfortunately, this is as good as things get. This is the world the capitalists wanted. Progress to them means dollars, nothing more. The natural world, its denizens, peoples everywhere, and the countries they depend on, only matter so long as powerful companies can make a profit. In Borneo this means stealing land from locals and burning ancient rainforest for palm oil plantations. In South America this means taking advantage of desperate people in order to mine and burn the Amazon. 

And in America, it means the privatization of every institution, especially those associated with personal progress. Although the privatized health industry is revolting, the commoditization of health is second only to the commoditization of education. Now individuals collect huge debt burdens for the promise of entering a new class of worker, one that isn't food insecure or struggling to pay for emergencies. But this individual has little more power than the man being forced to carry Chinese goods from the Philippines to another port (possibly without pay). Both were born into systems of control, and do what they have to in order to get by. Of more import are the systems of capital that control them. 

Consider that for every billionaire (who are largely white and born into their riches), millions more are forced to live in poverty. That one plane trip has the same carbon footprint as six Kenyans produce in a year. Consider that only 100 companies are responsible for 70% of carbon emissions. That these companies have bought multiple country's political establishments to further their own wealth at the cost of billions of lives. The argument can be made that as others gain electricity, and come online, they would attempt to reenact America's consumerist tendencies, but this is only true because of the myth of progress. Without an expectation or ability to buy new things every year, people don't. And yet capital is so powerful a symbol that upon the arrival of American food in the middle east, many began to consider trips to these places a status move. This was marked with higher obesity rates, similar to the onset of obesity in western countries. A similar event occured when antidepression companies caused depression in Japan through a massive advertising campaign, a country that previously had no incidence of any similar disorder.

 This is all to say that capitalists are killing us. They feed us fattening foods, sell us cigarettes and alcohol, drugs and health, status, education, comfort, safety, and the idea that things are getting better as fast as the newest android device. By hijacking both our symbolic realism, and our dopamine reward network, they have devised the perfect machine to get people hooked on the system while they are still young.  The inability to progress in these societies lead to worse mental health outcomes. We are witness to the hubris of the powerful: the need for more. A class of ultrawealthy people have gained the ability to direct human society, psychology, and history, and to their own exponential benefit. They think they can leave us behind because to them the world, its resources, and people are all equally disposable. This isn't humanity's war, this is a war on humanity. 

TL;DR ""humanity"" didn't kill us, the exponentially of our systems, and the commoditization of both people and natural systems did.

"aakfnu","sustainability","action-oriented","i want to calculate my carbon footprint, but nothing is accurate...","i tried using several online calculators, but they all seem widely inaccurate, i used about 10 different ones, 7 of them put me far below average the other above it...

most of the used multiple choice questions or added half the information themselves, some even had questions i couldn't answer because none of the options were right.

&#x200B;

TLDR: especially the food related questions seem useless, the rest differs a lot per calculator

&#x200B;

a lot of them decided a portion of meat was 200 gram and the only options were never eat meat eat meat 3-5 times a week and everday... i'm at about 500 grams of meat/fish a week. (i get cuts of meat that aren't desired in my country so if i don't get them they'll be shipped to other countries or used in pet food.)

none of them had me fill in how many vegetables i ate only wether they were locally sourced, so most likely they use the national reccommendation of 200grams a day, not me nearly eating a kg a day.

diary was even worse in a test i entered that i didn't use diary... so the test decided that i used soy milk, because i had to use something right...

they also assumed i ate: bread, snacks, factory made condiments... i don't my diet is meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. almost everything locally sourced sometimes even foraged on my own...

&#x200B;

END TLDR:

Meet: [Lowly](https://www.lowlyfood.com/)

Each recipe has  a carbon footprint breakdown by ingredient and total emissions saved by eating the meal. There's also weekly menus plans with accompanying shopping lists to help people lower wastage.

I hope you guys like it. Feedback would be great.
