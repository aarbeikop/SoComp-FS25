"6dz5o5","collapse","skeptical","If we view the climate crisis as an emergency could global food rationing help?","In WWII the UK had to implement food rationing as it could not feed it's population without external sources.

In a world with about 2 billion people in food poverty and about 2 billion obese.

If we view the current situation as a long slow emergency/conflict could global food rationing help?

With food rationing you get the health benefits of caloric limited diet reducing obesity.  The capacity to redistribute food and counter famine as it should reduce wealth based distribution distortions.

Could global rationing reduce the carbon footprint of our global food system?

And would this pre-empt, near to mid term food shortages and allow for global food stockpiles to be grown and a redistribution network to be setup.","2017-05-29 08:35:09","9","16","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/6dz5o5/if_we_view_the_climate_crisis_as_an_emergency/","True","Arowx","1747873286.502553","carbon footprint","manual"
"69xyol","collapse","skeptical","We have to hope that nature will eventually reign us in","People mistakenly look at deforestation and climate change as problems that we're going to solve. They imagine we will come up with some sort of steady state economy, where everything we do is renewable and we can rely on the land that we have appropriated for ourselves.

I like to use the metaphor of the puzzle for this. As long as we keep inventing new solutions fast enough to solve the problems of our previous solutions, we will escape catastrophe. We ran out of wood and peat in the industrial era, but fortunately we figured out how to mine coal. Now that we figured out coal is ruining the atmosphere, we have to hurry up and invent renewable energy. 

Instead, I think we should look at what is happening as a process where we are inevitably prone to vast destruction that will continue relentlessly, until nature eventually intervenes. Our way of life inevitably comes associated with vast destruction and there is no realistic chance to make this phenomenon sustainable and functional. In reality, we have to reign in our destruction, until the problem is solved *for us*.

The metaphor I would use for this vision is the school shooter. Mankind is an angry teenager who brought a ridiculous amount of weaponry with him. We have no realistic chance of dismantling him ourselves. Instead, we recognize that the police will eventually show up and take him out. What's necessary is for us to reign in the damage until the police finally show up. We should barricade the doors with chairs, we should hide the children, we should distract and disorient the shooter and we should minimize the amount of damage he can do as long as we receive no outside help.

We can look at what is happening to our climate, what is happening to rainforests around the world, what is happening to the population in Africa and figure out that only a miracle will save us. Here's a question: If you know for sure that Africa is going to face one billion deaths in an Ebola epidemic by 2030, what would you do? The answer I think should be as following: We would sacrifice whatever we can, to help gorillas, elephants, rhinoceroses, hunter-gatherer tribes and rainforests to survive the coming difficult years, as we wait for the outside forces to relief our burden.

If we assume there's a technological solution ahead of us however, then everything is hopeless. If we figure out how to create a renewable economy, then soil erosion, population growth and deforestation will destroy everything and create a dystopia. The Guardian [noted recently](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/06/the-end-of-wild-elephants-why-we-must-not-let-africa-become-one-giant-food-farm) how most projections on how we're going to feed the world's growing population necessitate the demise of Africa's elephant population:

>Even if we beat poaching and illegal trade, their potential doom has been sealed in projections for population growth, and has already been priced into the commonly accepted solutions to how we humans plan to feed ourselves well into the century – by looking to Africa to be our next big breadbasket.

If we want the Great Barrier Reef to survive, if we want the rainforests to survive, if we want to see a future that's worth living in, then the answer is very simple: We have to barricade the doors, hide the children and pray for the Deus Ex Machine to hurry up and take out this monster.

This is what environmentalism entailed before it was turned into a neoliberal politically correct pet project. Earth First! was a bunch of rednecks who saw the forests they had known as children were being destroyed by the expansion of the industrial cancer. They decided to sabotage the developers and placed their faith in the eventual mass death of the human population in the kind of sudden drastic population contraction that has reoccurred throughout human history.

I don't expect the climatologists or Al Gore to come out and say that we need to keep our carbon footprint as low as possible until Ebola or a big solar flare manages to take us out, because that's not the kind of inspiring message you want to hear on Monday morning before you head off to work. It is however the reality we have to deal with. 

The history of humanity is one of destruction of the natural environment. That's bleak, but it's the reality we face. The Fertile Crescent is fertile no more. The survivors of the destruction that followed fled to Southern Europe. The Sahara [itself](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170314111320.htm) is a product of human land use. Before bottom trawling, the bottom of the North sea used to be covered with an enormous underwater oyster reef.

After the industrial revolution, the destruction merely accelerated. A third of the world's arable land was [lost](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/arable-land-soil-food-security-shortage) in the past forty years. When was the last time you heard anyone refer to the idea of soil neutrality, that we should generate as much fertile soil as we destroy? The idea is so far-fetched that nobody even bothers uttering it.

The next time you visit a national park, be honest to yourself and entertain the following thought: ""What I am witness to here is something I hope to see outlive me. This forest in all its beauty exists to repopulate the land when me, my family, my coworkers and everyone else I know drops dead."" 

Its very survival depends on a catastrophe. Without such a catastrophe, a forest is merely a natural resource we have set apart for future generations to exploit, it becomes little more than a savings account. They might need the soil to grow wheat, they might discover oil beneath their feet, or perhaps they will find the rare minerals there that they will use to build a better battery for their car. Its survival depends on our non-survival.

When it comes to the renewable economy we envision, the reality is that it entails simply destroying whatever we have left. In Sweden more than half of old growth forest has been [lost](http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2749552/swedish_wildlife_extinction_threat_as_loggers_clearcut_old_growth_forests.html) since 1950. The forests are used as ""biomass"" that can be burned to produce ""renewable energy"". Of course biomass was already unsustainable in the medieval era, when a fraction of the population used a fraction of the energy we use today. Nobody has a serious plan to solve our problem, everyone just kicks the can down the hall for another few years.

You will resent me for saying it, but the greatest tragedy of the 21st century so far has been the fact that the West African Ebola epidemic was nipped in the bud. Treating the Ebola outbreak in Africa merely delayed the eventual catastrophe. By eradicating Ebola, we made it so that the African population will go through a Malthusian catastrophe after the last rainforests are removed and the apes are hunted into extinction, rather than before.

In West Point, Monrovia, where Ebola managed to gain a foothold, Vice documentary makers took a look. They found a slum where people defecate out in the open. Teenage boys high on drugs brag to the camera about raping ""big belly women"". A few houses further, prostitutes lie in makeshift houses, with walls covered by blood. The nurses and doctors returned home to their countries of origin where they were welcomed as heroes after the epidemic came to an end, but what higher goal was accomplished, by allowing such pointless suffering to persist?

It is obvious that the average European causes far more environmental damage in his day to day existence than the average dweller in an African slum, but that is besides the point. The question to ponder now is: How do these lives enrich existence? The European's standard of living allows him to make inventions, read classical literature, visit mountain tops or travel to the depths of the ocean. But for the 4.2 billion people expected to replace the elephants, gorillas, rhinoceroses and lions, what kind of lives do we have to look forward to as a source of consolation for the beauty that will be lost?

The hunter-gatherer pygmy tribes in the Congolese rainforest have a rich tradition of polyphonic chants studied by Western music historians. They amaze Western anthropologists with their detailed knowledge of the wild animals they hunt, knowledge that extends far beyond what's needed to survive. They climb in tall trees, to gather wild honey for their wives and children. The lives they live are worth living.

But what about the African living in his overpopulated slum? What is it he can expect to find there to enrich his existence? Would anyone choose before birth to open his eyes there for the first time in his mother's arms? In Gauteng province, 37.4% of men readily admit in surveys to having raped a woman. If you were given the choice between non-existence and reincarnation there, what would you choose? 

Today in South Sudan, a nation ravaged by climate change, militias force women under gunpoint to eat their own children. It barely even reaches the news, nobody wants to hear about it. When Ota Benga, an African pygmy in America, figured out the first world war would prevent him from returning to his tribe in Africa, he chose death. Today's refugees entering Europe from Africa risk death to get away from their countries of origin.

What I say offends people, but it is very simple: We face the prospect of replacing something good with an endless cesspool of misery and pointless suffering. I am more frightened of the world we now aim to create, than the catastrophe we might inevitably have set ourselves up for. The biggest blessing I can imagine is for nature to reign us in.","2017-05-08 13:06:55","11","8","0.63","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/69xyol/we_have_to_hope_that_nature_will_eventually_reign/","True","iuseupyourusernames","1747873322.060655","carbon footprint","manual"
