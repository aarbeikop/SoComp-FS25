"daw99lv","t3_5gzt0s","5gzt0s","collapse","skeptical","Summary: 

The hinges of resilience—of “resilience of what to what”—are moral questions, political questions. They are decisions about what we should change in the name of adaptation and what we should defend to the bitter end. Who gets the power to answer these questions? Catastrophic events might sound a wake-up call, but they won’t naturally, effortlessly lead us to the right answers; they can too easily be hijacked. Fitting events into the existing shape of individual, state, or corporate agendas is something everyone is skilled at. From this perspective it looks as if it’s those in the economic power centers of the neoliberal world, the disciples of creative destruction, who are best placed to master resilience. This is their claim on the future. And it must be contested: their resilience is catastrophic by design, morally unhinged, because it counts on the vulnerable to absorb what the market sheds so that the market’s irreparable fragility can be conserved. The vulnerable and the marginalized must have power, but not just the power to adapt; they must recapture the terms of adaptation, recapture the means by which a consensus of the vulnerable is possible. The fundamental choices are rightfully theirs. The answers should not belong to those who float free in the rainbow of chaos, never setting foot in the mud and ash and black water of disaster.","2016-12-07 13:14:49","1","gitacritic","1747864447.066526","carbon footprint","manual"

I've seen places in California that will allow to country of origin, label local produce, etc but I think it would be a stronger sell if the carbon footprint was on the label. 

Providing resources for companies to calculate their own environmental impact and incentives to display them would be a game changer in my opinion. I think your wiki could go a long way towards developing a framework. 

P.S. could you include a link to your wiki?","2016-12-20 16:06:03","7","chthonodynamis","1747864680.0474539","carbon footprint","manual"

That, and making documentaries to change their mind (e.g. Food, Inc) - I'm sure there are more, but those are the main ones for me","2016-12-20 12:53:01","5","fasnoosh","1747864680.0501509","carbon footprint","manual"
