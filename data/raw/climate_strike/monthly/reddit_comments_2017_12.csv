"dr0vve0","t3_7ijvfc","7ijvfc","climatechange","action-oriented","I never realized climate change would have too much of an impact on forest fires, but after reading your post, I went to look up articles. It increases the spread of forest fires mostly due to the higher temperatures making the wood drier. With the combination of California's drought, the forested areas are even drier. ""These hot, dry conditions also increase the likelihood that, once wildfires are started by lightning strikes or human error, they will be more intense and long-burning. The costs of wildfires, in terms of risks to human life and health, property damage, and state and federal dollars, are devastating, and they are only likely to increase unless we better address the risks of wildfires and reduce our activities that lead to further climate change.""
