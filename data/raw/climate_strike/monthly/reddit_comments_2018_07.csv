  I’m a new sub, so this is the first one of your posts I’m reading. I read through about half of the articles before I had to take a break, so this post isn’t as much about the content, but rather the context of the post. I wanted to first say what an amazing job you’ve done collecting these sources. It is imperative that we know the information presented here, and because it’s not sexy enough to sell papers, I don’t think it gets presented often. This leads me to a couple questions.   
  
  1. How can I assist you in doing what you’re doing? I truly believe presenting facts in the face of folly is important, and if I can help, I want to. 
  
  2. How best can we share this information? Have you found a way that works best?  
   
  I hope these questions find you well, and I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks again.

As I understand it, research in the field of sustainability is still in it's infancy, so I appreciate the effort behind this list. May I ask how you got into your current line of work, if you don't mind answering?","2018-07-04 21:28:50","7","SkankingDevil","1747815499.8704178","climate strike","manual"

However, I was wondering how long you believe this process will take? I know that this is highly speculative, but I would be interested in your opinion.

"e1t3b5y","t3_8w4tvr","8w4tvr","sustainability","action-oriented","THanks for posting this.  You're underscoring my own observations for decades.
I'd also be interested, however, in your posting success stories which I certainly do come across.  Not as much as the negative, but they are there and I think it's extremely important to see what heroic work people are doing to reverse these terrible trends.","2018-07-05 01:11:18","1","Kunphen","1747815499.879072","climate strike","manual"
