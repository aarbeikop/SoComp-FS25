Oil's fraction of electricity generation i the US is minuscule, 0.6% according to the eia. So ""more than likely"" is actually ""virtually non at all"".

The plastic in a phone is being from petroleum is not relevant either. Concerns about climate change are related to CO2 in the atmosphere. The carbon in the plastic is rather obviously not in the atmosphere. The full life cycle energy cost of a product is of importance though as some or much of the energy to produce the product will produce CO2 emissions. The more states move towards low carbon sources the less importance that will be.

According to this (low quality) source the CO2 cost per smartphone is

>Manufacturing the average smartphone is estimated to create around 16kg of CO2 equivalent emissions. If you then add the amount of power the phone consumes over two years of average use then that figure rises to 22kg, but there’s also much more to consider.

[https://www.lovefone.co.uk/blogs/news/how-much-co2-does-it-take-to-make-a-smartphone](https://www.lovefone.co.uk/blogs/news/how-much-co2-does-it-take-to-make-a-smartphone)

Which is about

>The average passenger vehicle emits about 404 grams of CO2 per mile

[https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle)

40 miles of driving, if the source was accurate.

The childish argument of Mr Heller and others on this thread is a complete strawman that people are demanding an immidiate cessation of all activities that emit CO2. The actual argument is that we have a finite and defined CO2 budget to avoid exceeding 450ppm in the atmosphere and we need to cut excess consumption where we can but we also need to deploy the huge array of technologies we have available that will allow us to produce and consume energy in a low carbon fashion. Nuclear, renewables, grid storage, electric vehicles, new passenger rail services and other public transports, redeveloping our streets to be more active transport friendly (walking and cycling).

His argument is so bad, so contrary to actual data, that he can be dismissed as little more than a troll.","2019-09-22 06:05:05","3","[deleted]","1747829037.830593","climate strike","manual"

However can we reverse climate change by the end of our lifetimes? No. 

Most likely we can bring CO2 levels back to pre-industrial amount or even 350 ppm at the very least, by the middle to end of the next century. It's really not that far away considering everything. 

We can adapt to this, which is something that people seem to never talk about. There's such a huge push for switching over to renewables that people hardly seem to talk about how we also need to begin planning adaptation measures.

0% chance.

There are many theories, but I think the best one is this: The earth always had periods of heat and cold due to the distance between sun and earth. 
This makes our seasons and maybe this has lead to the fact that once Europe was covered by ice.

However even if this isn't the case, there is one thing for sure: CO2 isn't the Initiator, but the catalysator. 
We would have to take away large potions of the CO2 at once, which is only possible if we lower the emissions and plant so many trees that CO2 becomes O2 and C again. 

By only lowering the CO2 emissions nothing will change. Even more: If we would stop ALL CO2 emissions worldwide at once (which is impossible), the already existing CO2 would continue the climate change.

What people need to realize:

1. It's not 11:30, 11:55 or 12. It's already 6 in the afternoon. We are far beyond our limits. 

2. Climate Change isn't the only problem in this world. What about the pollution of the world by plastic in the ocean or oil? These problems needs to be adressed too ASAP. 

3. Climate Change protests need to become radical. You can't save the world by a new tax or by surfing from France to USA. You can only save the world by destroying this bad system and building a new one where nature is priority #1.","2019-09-22 11:19:36","-2","HeldDerZeit","1747829079.831234","climate strike","manual"

I sometimes like to go on the NOAA site on occasion to look at interesting statistics and trends for fun sometimes.

This September has been _exceptionally_ wet for the US.  Particularly in the Midwest, where I'm at, it's causing quite a few problems for farmers who would have, in the past, normally have liked to be harvesting around now.  These farmers got into the fields late this year on account of excessive flooding and wet fields that were not ready for planting.  A lot of fields had standing water in them.  Now that it is harvest season, farmers are running into the same problem they did last year.  Last September we in our area, had 4 times our normal precipitation rate.  This year, throughout the US in September while the monthly totals aren't in yet, the largest daily accumulations of rainfalls for September are insane again.  

https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/records

I think my question is best suited to Dr. Dukes or Dr. Cloyd, what are your thoughts on the 'micro vs macro' drivers of climate change? 

Specifically, in my understanding, if a relatively small area, such as that surrounding a human settlement or industry, has substantial change in vegetation/albedo/local emissions this area is far more likely to experience effects which are likely to be ascribed to 'climate change'. This is accurate in that the climate has changed but innaccurate in that the reduction of global atmospheric carbon is not going to help the degraded local environment and as such is not likely to reduce the immediate impacts of climate change that these areas are experiencing.

Are you aware of any studies quantifying the 'micro' effect at a local level and how it contributes to the 'macro' or global effect?","2019-09-20 13:37:40","5","Dragoarms","1747829206.331412","climate strike","manual"
"f0vo2ht","t3_d6uez5","d6uez5","science","scientific","An article caught my attention yesterday because Cory Booker advocated for nuclear power in addition to expanding renewables. The article contained some interesting information regarding how significant nuclear power is in aiding our transition away from fossil fuels that I had never seen before. Here is a summary:

-	in order for renewables to replace coal and natural gas plants by 2050 renewables must grow an average of 2% per year (currently they average 0.6%, according to the article)
-	if we simultaneously increase the number of electric vehicles on the roads to replace ICE vehicles we would need to double total capacity which would require a growth in renewable energy more than 7 times the current rate (presumably the article means replacing all ICEs, but it does not specify)
-	if we phase out nuclear plants by 2035 this increases the required growth rate of renewables to 17x current rates
-	if we decommissioned nuclear plants immediately the growth rate for renewables becomes 25x current rates

I didn’t see any source for these specific statistics. Does this information seem accurate? Where do you see nuclear power fitting in while we transition away from coal and natural gas? 

Based on the article we are nowhere close to the required growth rate for renewable energy to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050, how do we start to close that gap and make up for the deficit? What do you think is the primary reason we have not achieved the rate required?

To me this is the main issue. We rely on the current system literally for survival. It takes serious motivation and more cash than most people have to buy land and build an off grid homestead. Very few people have that level of motivation and there's probably not enough arable land for all 7.73B of us to do that.

I don't see strikes resulting in anything other than empty promises from the establishment. The establishment is literally based on exploitation of people and resources. Asking it to stop doing that is like asking a person to stop breathing,  a lion to go vegan or a dog to do your laundry. It's outside the bounds and functions of the system.

The sooner the masses realize that the sooner we'll make progress. A new system is required. One that looks nothing like the current system.

"f1n7wml","t3_d9zd5r","d9zd5r","sustainability","action-oriented","Interesting question... This is not scientific but:

Transportation: Coffee is pretty light and it's shipped in bulk. I only go through about 12lbs a year which is probably not a large carbon footprint from the shipping compared to the rest of my carbon footprint. 

Packaging: I buy my coffee from the bulk bins at grocery stores or the food coop and I reuse the little bags 3 or 4 times before they are worn out. I could instead bring a jar which would probably even keep it fresher.

Farming practices: This is more tricky to measure and track but you could look into some of the brands that are available in your area in bulk bins. I like the equal exchange brand but I havent done much research on them. This is also somewhat tricky since people have different values around farming. Are you concerned with how much the farmers are getting paid or just the climate aspect? I'm not sure about coffee farming in particular, but I've worked on several small orgainc vegetable farms and given some thought to the impacts of farming. Counter intuitively, sometimes large scale monocrop farming with huge equipment can actually have a lower carbon footprint than small diversified farms since they can grow such huge quantities of food. Another counter intuitive example is a pesticide or fungicide might reduce damaged crops and increase yield per acre. These practices have other serious drawbacks to sustainability including insect collapse and chemicals leeching into groundwater but they might not look so bad from a strictly carbon footprint perspective.","2019-09-27 19:03:30","2","[deleted]","1747830217.3276129","climate strike","manual"

In short, your own consumption means exactly nothing to conservation unless it results in increase in price of the commodity.","2019-09-27 16:10:59","-2","thedvorakian","1747830217.331553","climate strike","manual"

It was difficult to know because I don't speak the language, but it felt like it wasn't a huge impact unfortunately. It turned a lot of heads, but it felt more like a parade than a protest. Might be due to how politely it was undertaken. It caused very minimal disruption, but at least it gets the message out there.

There were also members of their parliament that participated, so the hope is there that they understand the importance of it.","2019-09-26 05:38:32","6","GeekBite","1747830222.747636","climate strike","manual"

I also wanted to participate and found a small local group who marched from around 545pm. It wasn't huge (about 30-40 people) but it still happened. Incidentally it was organised by an American. I think protest culture isn't big in Japan as people are very mindful of being polite and cooperative.","2019-09-26 12:37:38","1","maestrojxg","1747830222.753226","climate strike","manual"
