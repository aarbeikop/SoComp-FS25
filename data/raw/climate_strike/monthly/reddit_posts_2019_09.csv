You have not done anything or ever will, go to tony hellers page and see the real graphs and climate records that haven't been forged, then you will see, you think you can think, but you can't think, you have nothing to think with!

First off, I stated that the video was clearly biased to be very anti-climate strike and that the channel as a whole was biased. And they shift the argument, telling me to get rid of my phone and computer for ""supporting climate change."" I quite literally don't know what that has to do with anything. I am not about to go and give my personal possessions away to anyone else.

I’m not trying to be pessimistic but I just generally want to get an educated answer as to how likely it is that the earth becomes inhabitable before the necessary changes are made. 

I understand that there are many different numbers, dates etc that are thrown around by scientists but if anyone who has a good, realistic insight into my question, I’d love to hear your input.

"d5g09s","climate","scientific","If you're going to the #ClimateStrike in the U.S...","Consider making the most out of your time there by [volunteering with the Environmental Voter Project](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved) asking attendees to [sign the Environmental Voter Pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge) and commit to casting an environmentally-responsible vote in every election in which they are eligible to vote. Once a person commits to being an Environmental Voter, EVP will send them elections reminders ahead of all upcoming elections they are eligible to vote in (I've received a couple texts since I signed up last year).

Between municipal elections, state elections, national elections, primaries, and generals, most Americans are probably eligible to vote in [3 or 4 elections per year](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did). Since [lawmakers *only* care what voters want, and ignore the concerns of nonvoters](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x), you can [raise the power and the profile of environmentalism by participating in every election, even the minor ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s), because [algorithms are powerful tools for extracting priorities from the electorate](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/02/15/voter-files-study-qa/), and it's possible to determine from publicly available information (with [89% accuracy](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf)) if you prioritize climate change or the environment. If EVP can do it, so can lawmakers. 

Why voting is critical to the climate movement: [We need systemic change](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/) (e.g. as the most recent IPCC report made clear, [pricing carbon is not optional](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf)) if we want any chance of meeting our targets, and as we've recently seen lawmakers who don't value the environment will act to dismantle existing environmental protection laws. 

Historically, [climate change and the environment have ranked low on voters' priorities](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf) ([because of low environmentalist turnout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s)) but [that is rapidly changing](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/green/A-Green-Wave-Signs-Point-to-Voters-Demanding-Action-on-Climate-Change-502796391.html), and [it](https://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Cornyn-says-days-of-ignoring-climate-change-are-13848205.php)'s [sh](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04062019/joe-biden-climate-change-plan-presidential-candidates-green-new-deal-clean-energy-obama)o[wi](http://time.com/4947960/lindsay-graham-climate-change-carbon-tax/)[ng](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/22/18691902/elizabeth-warren-2020-climate-change-policy-proposal-corruption) in [la](https://time.com/5659372/bernie-sanders-climate-plan/)w[ma](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4787637/sen-lamar-alexander-details-manhattan-project-clean-energy)k[er](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/fighting-the-political-winds)'s [re](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20848059/pete-buttigieg-2020-climate-change-plan)s[po](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/15/garret-graves-republican-climate-change-louisiana)n[ses](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-climate-plan/index.html). 

Voting is critical to our success as a climate movement because [voter priorities predict lawmaker priorities](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x). 

EVP turned out [58,961 eco-conscious voters who otherwise wouldn't have voted](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-vote-2020-environmental-voter-project_n_5d689479e4b0488c0d12103e) (as determined by randomized controlled trial) and now [over 2,000 candidates for public office are vowing not to accept fossil fuel money](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-vote-2020-environmental-voter-project_n_5d689479e4b0488c0d12103e).

What we need is a strike that will hit them hard. I think we should propose the following for the future strike. As a starting point we can even pick a weekend day to get most people to participate. On the day we choose....

* Absolutely no driving or travel of any kind (car, bus, train, motorcycle, airplane, cruise), basically anything that uses fossil fuel 
* No shopping whatsoever. Feel free to grocery shop the day before
* No online shopping
* Do not pay bills (on line or otherwise) on this day
* Do not get online. We can see the impacts the following day
* Use negligible electricity at home (lets pick a day in spring in northern hemisphere so the weather is not too extreme, maybe have the refrigerator running for perishable food)
* No eating out (PBJ?)

I am sure we can add many more to the list safely. The idea is to sit around the house and basically hang out with family or friends or just by yourself and talk about how fucked up the situation is. Yes, it is going to cause us some hardship, but it will send a very strong message that cannot be ignored. If they ignore it, lets do it again. Some industries will come to a halt if we all do this and the governments cannot let this happen, plus the government cannot stop us from doing this either.  We need to hit them hard, we need to hit them where it hurts before they will listen.

**It’s now cheaper to build new renewables than it is to build natural gas plants** (fastcompany.com) 

- lol, like that means anything.

I've been a progressive socialist since 1990, way back when the world promised to ""do"" something about climate change. I knew something was wrong when elites told us that paying carbon offsets for flights was a ""solution"" to climate change. That was 30 years ago, and emissions went up 60% since.

If you believed Obama would bring hope and change, you were disappointed, if you believed Trump would drain the swamp, you are disappointed. The only thing that got better was the number of bombs being dropped, which is up, up, up!

There have been 4 worldwide climate agreements since 1990, and each one them failed miserably. For the first 3 agreements, we overshot our promises by 100 mega tons /  year. In the last agreement, we've overshot promises by 200 mega tons / yr. At least we're improving on aspirational delusions. See chart link below:

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/canada-emissions-record.jpg?w=696

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% during your lifetime. For you we have Naomi Klein and Greta Thunberg, who are leading Millennials into the emerald green utopia of a socialist techno-nirvana. 

Their call for disruption is no more than blackmail, which is fine for them because they won't get evicted for not paying the rent on time. They can afford disruption, you can't. If anything really bad happens, they can flee to well stocked family cottages and ride out the storm.

Edward Snowden recently did an interview with France 24 on YT. He says that Google and Facebook are up to no good. That was an understatement. Putting Google and FB in charge of fake news is like putting Satan in charge of Heaven. By combining the control of fake news with demonetisation, that control will be total and complete -- sure, it will get rid of a few bad weeds, but not without taking out all the wildlife, just like Monsanto. 

Some say Google deranked bad news about Monsanto, and I believe it. Why? Because I don't trust either of them. I believe the same to be true of 5G. I base these beliefs on years of cynicism, not any definitive proof. Definitive proof is in short supply these days, and even if you find it, it gets totally ignored.

"d9f3m5","sustainability","action-oriented","Tokyo's climate strike happened at 5pm, but at least it happened.","My friend and I happened to be in Tokyo during the climate strike and so we joined in theirs while we were there.  
It was pretty absurd at first because it happened at 5pm... Yes, a work/school strike that begins after work/school.

Once we got past the weirdness and joined in, it became immediately apparent that Japan didn't have a very large base of people that were particularly concerned about this. Of course, part of that might be the language/cultural barrier, which means they are more likely to organise their own protests than jump on the back of world protests, but I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. We were, after all, in a country where many things sold are triple-wrapped in plastic and then handed over in a plastic bag. Not to mention all the coffee shops we saw where all the customers were sitting indoors, drinking from disposable coffee cups.

Mind-you, as far as I'm aware, they do a good job with their CO2 emissions, so I'm probably focussing on the small issues. Also, I'm relatively new to understanding these issues, so I'm not the best person to pass judgement. Nevertheless, once it kicked off, a huge number of people joined in. It was by no means anywhere near the numbers seen in other countries around the world, but it certainly wasn't fruitless.

It was odd how we had to wait for traffic and it took a while for the politeness of the Japanese culture to wear off enough for the chants to get going, but once it did, the march was great! It gained quite a bit of attention and it turned out that we were marching through rush hour, going through one of the busiest crosswalks in Japan, in the city of Shibuya.

We made a video of our experience in the march here if you're interested to check it out:

It's super interesting to see the change in atmosphere when the march properly kicks into gear.","2019-09-26 05:09:28","118","7","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/d9f3m5/tokyos_climate_strike_happened_at_5pm_but_at/","True","GeekBite","1747830218.1891048","climate strike","manual"
"d5g1z9","sustainability","action-oriented","If you're going to the #ClimateStrike in the U.S....","Consider making the most out of your time there by [volunteering with the Environmental Voter Project](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved) asking attendees to [sign the Environmental Voter Pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge) and commit to casting an environmentally-responsible vote in every election in which they are eligible to vote. Once a person commits to being an Environmental Voter, EVP will send them elections reminders ahead of all upcoming elections they are eligible to vote in (I've received a couple texts since I signed up last year).

Between municipal elections, state elections, national elections, primaries, and generals, most Americans are probably eligible to vote in [3 or 4 elections per year](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did). Since [lawmakers *only* care what voters want, and ignore the concerns of nonvoters](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x), you can [raise the power and the profile of environmentalism by participating in every election, even the minor ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s), because [algorithms are powerful tools for extracting priorities from the electorate](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/02/15/voter-files-study-qa/), and it's possible to determine from publicly available information (with [89% accuracy](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf)) if you prioritize climate change or the environment. If EVP can do it, so can lawmakers. 

Why voting is critical to the climate movement: [We need systemic change](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/) (e.g. as the most recent IPCC report made clear, [pricing carbon is not optional](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf)) if we want any chance of meeting our targets, and as we've recently seen lawmakers who don't value the environment will act to dismantle existing environmental protection laws. 

Historically, [climate change and the environment have ranked low on voters' priorities](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf) ([because of low environmentalist turnout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s)) but [that is rapidly changing](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/green/A-Green-Wave-Signs-Point-to-Voters-Demanding-Action-on-Climate-Change-502796391.html), and [it](https://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Cornyn-says-days-of-ignoring-climate-change-are-13848205.php)'s [sh](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04062019/joe-biden-climate-change-plan-presidential-candidates-green-new-deal-clean-energy-obama)o[wi](http://time.com/4947960/lindsay-graham-climate-change-carbon-tax/)[ng](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/22/18691902/elizabeth-warren-2020-climate-change-policy-proposal-corruption) in [la](https://time.com/5659372/bernie-sanders-climate-plan/)w[ma](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4787637/sen-lamar-alexander-details-manhattan-project-clean-energy)k[er](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/fighting-the-political-winds)'s [re](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20848059/pete-buttigieg-2020-climate-change-plan)s[po](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/15/garret-graves-republican-climate-change-louisiana)n[ses](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-climate-plan/index.html). 

Voting is critical to our success as a climate movement because [voter priorities predict lawmaker priorities](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x). 

EVP turned out [58,961 eco-conscious voters who otherwise wouldn't have voted](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-vote-2020-environmental-voter-project_n_5d689479e4b0488c0d12103e) (as determined by randomized controlled trial) and now [over 2,000 candidates for public office are vowing not to accept fossil fuel money](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/climate-vote-2020-environmental-voter-project_n_5d689479e4b0488c0d12103e). 

Anyone interested in volunteering with EVP at the \#ClimateStrike signing up Environmental Voters needs to get in touch with them by Wednesday (tomorrow) by 5:00 p.m. at the latest.
