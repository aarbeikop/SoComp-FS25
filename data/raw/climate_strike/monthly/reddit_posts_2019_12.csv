"e8navm","climatechange","action-oriented","Climate change is unimportant, is it? I live in NSW Australia. I feel every day like I'm living in an apocalypse film."," I live in NSW, Australia. We are on fire, and have been for weeks.

Today has been covered in smoke cloud. You can see it, and it wasn't just an early morning thing. It looks like 70s celluloid film of a wartime movie: hazy burnt orange, making any green look khaki. I look out at the late afternoon sun, and it's red. Not nice autumn orange, though we have just entered summer, it's *red* in a field of haze. It has been for days. The afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn't too thick for the sun to get through.

Today was 39 degrees Celsius. The winds have picked up. The firefighters have been at it for over a month. Over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt - there isn't much green left on our map. Huge portions of it are now soot black. You look at where the fires are, and the markers of them on the map overlap like you're looking at a field of wildflowers in blue, yellow, and red. People have lost their lives. People have lost their homes. The devastation of wildlife is huge.

Sydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban. I watered my plants with reserve water from the shower. My one cat has asthma. I've been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day. Otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all. It's week three of this.

We are in drought. Again. And it looks worse this time. There are parts of NSW where the dams are empty. Truly empty. Dust fields that are massive, nothing able to grow in these conditions.

The sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again - loud and multiple as I try to get to sleep. People who have it worse than my cat and can't breathe. I drive home and see firetrucks up by people's houses. I pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do.

It's two weeks to Christmas, and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun. Places I've been - places I know well - sit facing fires approaching them from all sides. ""I wish you all the luck in the world"" is what I can say to those I know facing it, and what I get back is ""We will stand and defend our home.""

These aren't small fires that burn out in days. These are firegrounds larger than Sydney itself that have been burning for weeks. The hot air rises from them, along with the ash, and it meets the damp winds off the ocean. The result is a thunderstorm.

You'd think rain would put these fires out. It does not. The ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing. The fires keep raging, even as water, unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it, floods away from them. We get floods on top of fires. Sooty water running away from a blaze that won't stop blazing.

These thunderstorms are unlike any I have ever seen before. People say thunderstorms bring a false twilight. This is a very late twilight - nautical twilight, perhaps. Early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting. And it's a while yet before the rain falls, though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash-ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones. You just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn't happen nearby.

Because these thunderstorms start new fires. They put nothing out, while, at the same time, bring more fire; more destruction.

I've sat on tenterhooks, waiting to hear whether I'm needed to help evacuate people. I've watched places I know well go up in smoke. I've waded through that smoke haze, feeling like I have a constant burgeoning cold, trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place I live, where my loved ones live, is to be short lived.

And then there are the arsonists. I'm at a point where I'd wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who, in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering, did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires. More water that we don't have spent on fighting them. Planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people, more homes, and more wildlife are destroyed. All because of some absolute wanker who thought it'd be ""funny"" or ""cool"".

Outside my window is sepia tones. It isn't usually. Usually it's blue, and an Australian green; and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks. It seems all is bathed in that burnt orange; we're all feeling it, some more than others.

I look at Wollemi National Park on Wikipedia. Only home to a species of tree they thought was extinct on the mainland. Home to Aboriginal heritage sites. Home to a great many things. An amazing space of wilderness, it tells you, so worthy of preserving. Not a word about the fact that it is black.

Never before in my life have I been so tempted to edit a Wikipedia article as I was just to add the salient point: ""*it's on fire""*. There's little of it left. I tried to edit it. I had the sources I was going to cite with me. I don't understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out, as the fires are doing, the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is.

""Climate change?"" they say. ""What climate change?""

I looked at Cape Town, South Africa and thought, ""Thank the fates we have it okay here!""

Now I look outside and wonder how long it's all going to last. It's hard not to be fatalistic when you're living in a place that's giving you every bloody indication you, your species, and all you care for is inhospitable here. That all the fucking around we've been doing has just been begging for this to happen.","2019-12-10 07:06:28","218","41","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e8navm/climate_change_is_unimportant_is_it_i_live_in_nsw/","True","GertieGuss","1747832911.218732","climate strike","manual"

mountain glaciers and rivers will start to disappear and mountainous regions will see more landslides, as the permafrost that held them together melts away.

Sea levels could rise by a metre, displacing 10% of the world's population. Countries such as the Maldives will be submerged and the Indian subcontinent will be left fighting for survival. People will also die in greater numbers as they struggle with the increasing heat.

The ecosystem will collapse and a third of all life on earth will face extinction. Plant growth will slow, then stop. Plants don't absorb carbon dioxide very well so begin to emit it - making global warming worse.

The world's food centres will become barren and one third of the planet will be without fresh water.

3 ℃ - 
up to 40% of the Amazon rainforest will be destroyed and warmer soil will kill vegetation and release more carbon.

Hurricanes will be stronger and cities in Asia, Australia and the south-east of the US will face destruction. Holland will be torn apart by the North Sea.

Saltwater will creep upstream, poisoning the groundwater and ruining the food supply.

4 ℃ - 
millions of people will begin to flee coastal areas, cities will begin to vanish and some will become islands.

The ice at both poles will vanish over time and this could see a rise in sea levels of as much as 50m, although this may take hundreds or thousands of years.

China, a major producer of the world's rice, wheat and maize, could see its agriculture fail - it will need to feed more than a billion people on two-thirds of its current harvest.

Summers will be longer and soaring temperatures will see forests turn to firewood, with even Britain's south reaching 45 ℃. The increased demand on air-conditioning puts massive pressure on the country's power grid.

5 ℃ higher in the oceans - 
frozen methane hydrate from the seabeds will gasify and ascend to the atmosphere. 
Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and may cause an extra temperature rise of 4-5 ℃ over time. 

6 ℃ - 
rainforests will be deserts and massive numbers of migrants will flock to the few parts of the world they see as inhabitable, resulting in racial conflict and civil war.

Many will choose places such as Canada and Siberia but even those climates may be too hot to grow food.

Stagnant oceans mean more hydrogen sulphide, which kills the sea-life and, if the sea heats up enough, massive stores of methane hydrate under the sea will begin to escape.

Methane is flammable and the smallest spark or lightning strike could see fireballs tearing across the sky. 

10 ℃ - is generally accepted as a figure able to cause truly global mass extinction.
