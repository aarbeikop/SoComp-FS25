Actually, all sarcasm aside, this is a rare moment of transparency among the MMCC cultists.  Gone is any attempt to present a rational, fact-based argument; instead they are going straight for the appeal to our emotions by pulling on our heartstrings with this dramatic analogy.  And that's all this movement ever was; you are looking at the sum total of their substance (and intellect).

Not to mention the crazy coincidence that they are all 3 youths, who we all know are the wisest and most learned among us.  That's why you only see their age group in positions of leadership in government and private industry alike. I imagine the 3 wise teens who visited baby Jesus looked a lot like them.

I guess they didn't get the memo from their American brethren about the inherent racism in the rope & noose imagery.  I can only hope that this is a traveling performance and that their world tour takes them through Detroit, Chicago &  St. Louis.","2019-07-09 00:13:36","-19","Privateer419","1747827046.873802","climate strike","manual"
