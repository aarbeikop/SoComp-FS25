The psychological warfare Zuckerberg needs to get enough money to [take away land from native Hawaiians for his private estates](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/mark-zuckerberg-sues-to-keep-native-hawaiians-off-his-kauai-estate) isn't cheap.  

[Ecosteader](https://ecosteader.com/about) is a non-corporate public benefit (nonprofit) company I took official last year.  It's , basically a 24/7 network for people who care about living sustainably all the time.  We have tons of urban gardeners, solar punk builders, low-tech / small living hacks.... the local network feed is full of people doing neat things that all add up in small ways.. It helps a lot to know your individual actions aren't isolated.

"f26ujry","t3_dc0sxr","dc0sxr","sustainability","action-oriented","Follow Greta Thunberg's example and advice: Do whatever *you personally can*: 

""No one is too small to make a difference."" Everyone should do everything they can.

1. Talk to your friends, family, neighbors, coworkers-- let them know what you're doing and why. Especially in the US, the CO2 conservation movement hasn't taken hold culturally. The public needs to feel it is a trend before they change their behavior (cause we can't sit around and wait for government mandates), so the more of us who talk it up, the more it will be perceived as ""the thing to do."" Peer/social pressure is a powerful tool.

2. Advocate, lobby, vote-- *from the local level* to the national level. And you personally can make a much bigger impact at the local level. Get a group of friends together who care and go to your town council meeting. Ask what they're doing as a city to address the climate crisis-- what zoning laws have been changed? What incentives are there to plant trees, go solar or plant locally appropriate gardens instead of resource destroying lawns? Does the town have a contract with an alternative electricity supplier to give residents a discount? Are there bike lanes being painted or installed? Etc. You can Google what kinds of things can be done at the local level. And once *your* town does it, surrounding communities have a local precedent to follow.

3. Look at your own life and CO2 consumption habits. How can you shrink your footprint? Generate less CO2 than you did last week. Every week.","2019-10-02 13:42:26","2","LudovicoSpecs","1747831492.344168","climate strike","manual"

"f27wf43","t3_dc0sxr","dc0sxr","sustainability","action-oriented","Find a group of like-minded passionate individuals in your community and figure out what you can accomplish at the local level. A relatively small group of people can have a massive amount of influence on the local level. Maybe start a campaign to get your city council to create more bike lanes, or pass new city ordinances to increase native ecosystems (in the midwest USA that would mean planting more prairie grasses instead of turf grass, planting more trees, etc.). There are no one-size-fits-all approach, because every community is different. But it's incredibly important that you try to bring your community together to work towards solutions you can actually achieve in your locality, because that is where you are most powerful. It also makes it much easier to connect with other community organizations from within your community and neighboring towns to work together to achieve larger goals that you wouldn't otherwise be able to with just a few friends.

Don't get stuck thinking your only options are protests and personal lifestyle changes. Community organizing is a powerful tool that has been proven throughout history to be successful at creating lasting change.","2019-10-02 20:18:29","1","[deleted]","1747831492.3498828","climate strike","manual"

The strike played a part in this and in my opinion did shift the position of climate into global conversation (i.e. my colleagues now talk about climate change at work and i rarely overheard any discussions on before). 

Don't get me wrong i wanted, and indeed expected, more from it (though it's still going on) but i think a lot of the action we need is always going to take time and shifts in government. This can't happen overnight, just keep the pressure up, keep doing what you can, inspire others and we'll get there (hopefully 😅).","2019-10-20 07:46:30","2","xCRAWx","1747831566.013875","climate strike","manual"
"f4cwbq1","t3_dkaw0r","dkaw0r","sustainability","action-oriented",">Anything contrary to the immediate phase out of fossil fuels is unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.

well, you certainly sound open-minded and optimistic. 

what about using fossil fuels to rebuild the grid and then attempt to reverse things? not even saying that is a good idea but you leave very little space open to discussion when you say anything contrary to my perspective is "" unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.""

a big part of this discussion needs to be winning people over to a new way of thinking. without optimism that it can be done, what's the point? 

what about the people who see the threat but are pessimistic. why work today if the battle is unwinnable? 

I happen to think its totally winnable. we went to the moon after 60 years of flight. cured smallpox. travelled faster than sound. The shift to a green economy is nothing but the next great adventure.

so fight. try. do what you can. buy a tree. talk to people with an open-minded optimistic perspective. lower yourself to this one task and maybe the next hurdle will be easier. 

like will smith said: you don't build great wall by trying to build a wall. you just set one brick as perfectly as one brick can be set, then another and another and sooner or later you have a wall. 

so here is your challenge if you want to accept it, make everyone around you believe that it's winnable, that its worth fighting. that humanity is worth saving. convince everyone around you, maybe start with yourself?","2019-10-20 01:25:54","0","disciplinepadawan","1747831566.01928","climate strike","manual"
