"dfgqbcz","t3_61rj29","61rj29","collapse","skeptical","I don't think this is a good idea. Mainly because:

- those comments were already downvoted, and in general, /r/collapse is pretty good at downvoting crap content (whether it be denialist shit, shilling, or sock puppets) - and this is honestly one of the principal reasons I come here: people around here are the non-aligning but also common sensical and thinking kind. We're all here because we believe collapse is imminent, but there is no ""side"" to be on. It's a weirdly nihilistic place, and I'd say more than average, the people here are probably sensible thinkers. A proper collapsnick recognizes that there really isn't any pay-off in being right about this or belonging to the group of people that are right

- creating a rule to keep these out won't solve a real problem, only a minor nuisance, and is likely to create more problems


Case in point: the comment you cited by maketotaldestroi isn't exactly something I'd consider worthy of creating a rule against. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I don't necessarily disagree with it either. I'm just kinda in a ""don't care"" state about that particular issue and others are welcome to have their ideas. More importantly, I feel there is something to be gained by knowing what others are thinking... I do think that if I lived in the states, I might actually have a different opinion about it.

In contrast, the other comments you cite are what I'd call plain dumb. They likely didn't contribute to the thread, and if they did, then the thread was uninteresting itself. They're dumb because they're not insightful, they're barely thought out, and they really don't make me think of anything new. That comment about outbreeding others, for instance, reeks of someone who hasn't gone through childbirth and raising an infant, let alone 4... But since they were already downvoted, who cares?

So take that comment by total destroi: if it had been somehow banned, and then /r/collapse ends up on subreddit drama or some such, and then the uncensored news folk get a hold of it and descend upon this place, I think the damage would be immeasurably greater than some shitty comments could ever have been.

As for your empathy clause, it's hard to not end up where the DNC ended. We can't police people to be model citizens. The best we can do is ban actual threats, and this is already part of the reddit rules. 

The second best we can do is enforce high quality content. And I think in general people are doing a good job of upvoting and downvoting shit.

PS. If anything, I'd think about hiding collapse from all if that's at all possible... ","2017-03-27 12:18:20","28","perspectiveiskey","1747796487.75324","climate strike","manual"

As the moderators of this forum, you get to decide what type of conversation the forum is striving towards. This doesn't always result in the type of discussion you'd like, but establishing a direction and a tone is an essential part of moderation.

In the past couple of years, it's been proven time and time again that if subs on Reddit don't pay careful attention, they'll quickly be infiltrated by the kind of hateful racist garbage that's taken over most discussions these days. The racists have learned to play this system beautifully, and just a handful of them can turn an entire sub toxic within weeks.

This sub is particularly vulnerable, dealing as we do with the upcoming population bottleneck. It's easy to make the leap from 'there are too many people' to 'there are too many people that I dislike', and from there the conversation just deteriorates. Downvoting helps, but the damage is done; those conversations don't tend to recover.

There's an organized movement to disrupt productive discussions on Reddit and turn them into hateful flamefests. Putting measures in place to defend against that seems prudent.","2017-03-27 12:50:26","13","MrVisible","1747796487.7636638","climate strike","manual"

"dfh1k2j","t3_61rj29","61rj29","collapse","skeptical","I’d say leave the policy as is. 

I value the more outlandish opinions, even the ones I don’t agree with. They give me a sense of how these issues are truly effecting the mindsets of potentially rational people. If these are the opinions of people that are willing to admit these monstrous opinions, there must be more out there that have the good sense to not admit them in public. Keeping a general sense for the level of murderous desperation in the population is for me, a valuable measure and indicator of level of collapse. Disagreeable though they may be to my personal values. 

The frequency and severity of these types of comments are for me a collapse indicator in and of themselves and are part of the reason I come here. 

Even the ones that I can’t get any education or perspective out of I have to admit, I often find kind of humorous or entertaining (looking at MakeTotalDestr0i and my all-time favorite fishmahboi’s weekly cannibalism predictions). 

At the end of the day everyone here has a non-typical outlook on the world. Lets try to have some empathy for some of these people that can’t hold it together as well as others or give in to more aggressive mental solutions. Its hard to be rational and empathetic in the face of your own destruction. 

Also agree with u/perspectiveiskey that banning might lead to more unnecessary and undesired drama and attention.

"dfhnc6i","t3_61rj29","61rj29","collapse","skeptical","While I agree that some people have very extreme opinions around here, I think that many of you are easily offended. Take u/ReverseEngineer77 for example. He keeps calling people that wish humanity, key word here is WISH, to go extinct sociopaths and misantrophes, and he is far from the only one who does this. The thing is, they seem to ignore what sociopathy and misantrophy really are. I think it is safe to say no one here has kidnapped a person to torture him/her or is a thief and a mugger or a serial killer, or a lone wolf that will shoot up a mall or something. Those are sociopaths and misanthropes and there is a world of difference from people here that wish us to go extinct because of the damage we are doing to the planet and them. Note that a simple wish has no agency on reality so I don't understand why we need to censor such a stance.

What are you proposing is like changing this sub to be more like a support group where we can get those virtual hugz and all that good stuff, but there is already a small sub dedicated to that. It is the first one on the suggested bar on the right. It is literally called Collapse Support, and if anyone wants to vent off or expose their true feelings, they will find all the empathy they want over there. This sub is related to news of collapse and vast philosophical discussions about this late stage of industrial civilization. If there are news of people in Africa suffering death and starvation, then of course the population issue will arise and it should because it is a very valid point to make. Where else can overpopulation be discussed as a cause of collapse if not here? Do we truly want all comments regarding disaster here to be grieving, even if it is faked, or just offering your condolences? Am I not allowed to express my disdain for our insane culture, and for all the people that help perpetuate it? I agree that there is a line here, but we are very, very far from crossing it. Hell, I once demanded ecofascism and even got showcased on Cowwapse for it. Does that make me eligible for banning? This sub is not full of idiots, at least the regulars aren't. A little trust goes a long way.

Don't fool yourself though, I am totally against shitposting, especially in comments, but I find that people do a good job of downvoting correctly, for the most part. The issue to me is that for the past few weeks a lot of newcomers have been asking the same questions over and over again in text posts, others have been writing up stupid shit that will end up dissapearing anyway, but it still pollutes the main page. This may be due to the growing number of readers which increased by 7000 since Trump got elected. To solve this I suggested that we should create a sticky thread of what a person new to the collapse should read, maybe even in a democratic fashion by having people submitting entries and then voting on them, or else letting the mods choose which blogs, videos to show. I even offered to help you guys do it because Brando said that you were too time constrained, but I didn't get an answer. 

In short, I would not like for this to become a safe space like many other subs seem to be, where just mentioning Trump or something is enough for you to get sent to hell, and I think that post quality would greatly improve if all people had access to the same amount of information.","2017-03-27 23:18:28","11","[deleted]","1747796487.7720058","climate strike","manual"

4. creating racist websites on the Internet

"dfh74vs","t3_61rj29","61rj29","collapse","skeptical"," Well, I see no problem with most of the views cited.

Since we are evidently incapable of restricting birth rates globally (vide [Egypt](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/61k5bb/forget_isis_egypts_population_is_its_biggest/) and [Somalia](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5zdjmr/xpost_from_roverpopulation_in_droughtstricken/) as specifically discussed here recently,) the only solution is (exactly as proposed  by the now 'banned-on-a-technicality' diversity_is_racism,) to see the death rate rise.

This is not a matter of advocating or promoting it, but merely an observation that that is how reality actually is, and how nature will impose the solution, even if we're too squeamish or incompetent to do anything about it ourselves. That is how nature and biology work, and how the vigour and genetic health of species is maintained by evolutionary processes (despite progressive Western society having done its best to ignore this ever since the 60s.) 

We know this. It is what ecology and biology teach us - but, oh I forgot, humanity is a special case, and the rules don't apply to us /s

It is also demonstrably unavoidable once the environmental carrying capacity is so extremely overextended (is that really such a contentious point? here in /r/collapse of all places???)

If the post-war progressives hadn't intervened with their green revolution, and their social welfare, and their international aid, and all rest of the lunatic bullshit hopium, the die-off wouldn't have to be anything like as painful now - it would have been amortised over the generations as it always had been, and there would not now be 7.whatever gigamonkeys consuming the planet out from under themselves. But we let the baby boomers steal the future until it was all gone, and now we're all going to pay (and no amount of fantasising about UBI/fairer distribution/space colonisation/bitcoin/voluntary action/alternative energy/pixie dust/whatever is going to change that.)

But point that out, and get banned on some other pretext, just to silence an unwelcome message seems to be the order of the day. It's the modern way I suppose.

iamsorryunbanme takes a similar non-PC line, but is also only stating the way nature actually works - always guaranteed to enrage the PC antinatalist folk, who never pause to consider that with no vested interest in the future themselves, their own continued (and western scale to boot,) consumption is pure self-indulgence to the detriment of everyone else, and that they really ought to recognise that while they're still breathing they occupy the moral lowground - not the highground - continuing to use up resources while whining on the sidelines and condemning others.

And MakeTotalDestr0i's comment? How can anyone really disagree with the logic that one should fight back against those who tell you it is ""illegal to survive""?

His might be an inaccurate assessment (in which case challenge these points,) or a hyperbolic description (I think it currently is a bit, though things are heading that way certainly,) but blanket disagreement merely puts one in the logical position of claiming that noone has a right to defend themselves even from death. And I would have to disagree profoundly with that.

The contrary views to these points are, to my mind, utterly deluded (though all too common, and regularly enough go unchallenged to constitute the status quo these days,) and the root cause of almost all our problems now it's been mainstream for several generations. 

But I (like to think I) am polite and respectful enough to allow others their delusions, and so don't froth venomously in the comments like, for example (and since you cite it yourself,) Topyka2's comment (not included in the list of 'offensive' comments,) which seems to be merely cited neutrally as confirmation that something should be done to prevent the expression of views that enrage any snowflakes who deny the reality of how things actually work, when in fact it is itself a genuinely unnecessary and aggressively abusive comment that adds nothing to the debate (but hey, he/she is taking the ""approved"" position, so should be cut more slack than those who are merely correct, yeah?)

This comment and 420AznButtsecks69's are the only comments you cite that I would term ""abusive"" - the others seem like common sense to me (and no amount of silent downvoting of such comments is going to change my opinion, because I'm not a sheep, don't require validation by faceless netizens, and prefer reasoned argument.)

But pandering to snowflakes is the ""new normal"" I guess, and god knows, there's a vocal contingent of deluded hand-wringing progressives here (mentioning no names of course,) just like everywhere else, happy to downvote anything that interferes with their cosy, delusional narratives.

Just as there are other contingents of equally delusional deniers/racists/fruitloops. I have to say that of course, in the interest of ""balance"" - I've said it repeatedly, but the progressive censoriat always insist that nothing nice can ever be said about those who they disagree with, or anything nasty about their own fascistic tendencies without demonstrating ""balance"" by saying something equally nasty about the other side (and usually not even then.)

FWIW I reckon you banned the wrong user (if you're going to ban anyone anyway.)

But I'm not a mod, and I know you guys have a hard time keeping balance in the force here (and you do generally do an excellent job,) - we're an unusually diverse community (politically anyway,) and probably blessed with more than our fair share of nonconformists and free thinkers. And it's a never-ending and largely thankless task.

But basing these decisions on voting patterns displayed by a tiny minority of users (single-figure downvotes for a community with a 5-figure membership,) seems crazy to me - neither democratic nor rational. Just pandering to the most vocal 0.00something%, and bypassing the natural reddit mechanism that sidelines downvoted posts into obscurity. That seems unnecessary.

It strikes me that much of the offense and objection comes not from what such folks say, but from how their statements are decoded to 'what we know they really mean' by the rabidly PC thought police (I know this from repeated personal experience.) And that's bullshit - literally putting words in other people's mouths, and then judging them on that instead. But I'm used to that.

Politeness and respect should be encouraged and cultivated, yes. And real facts should always be preferred over 'alternative' facts (aka lies.) And there's a strong case that can be made for censoring aggression and abuse. I agree with you there.

But that doesn't seem consistent with the different treatments meted out to diversity_is_racism (polite enough IMO but banned) and Topyka2 (held up as evidence that some people are offended, but apparently thin-skinned, illiterate and thuggish. Okay, I'm not *always* polite, but these were your examples, and seem pretty blatant to me.)

And I don't know how you can formulate a written rule to correct societal degradation and degeneracy on the scale we currently see. Our liberal Western culture is insane, and currently engaged in expunging all genuine diversity and sustainability by forcing its globalised consumerist agenda onto every last community and individual on the planet. I absolutely agree with d_i_r on that (even if I profoundly disagree with his take on AGW, and think /r/collapse is a (slightly) poorer place in his absence.

Lol, you wanted honest feedback, and that's mine - fairly forthright as usual. Cue downvotes from the handwringing leftist brigade :) They really don't like to be confronted with reality, aka Just The Way It Is Kid™, and it enrages them to see contrary opinions expressed, which in the interest of healthy and honest debate is something we should see more of I think.

If we are relying on majority consensus then downvoting individual comments would work just as well. All that people want out of r/collapse is for good content to be easy to find. If a bunch of bad content is all neatly in the bottom of each thread due to downvotes then that doesn't negatively impact the usability of r/collapse at all. Banning people and adding rules restricting what people can say, however, always carries risks; risks that are unnecessary if the majority consensus can be heard in an easier, simpler, less top-down way.

The notion is alien to me that anyone would ever be in favor of letting someone else restrict what comments they see. The only reason for restricting what comments can be posted would be if the subreddit became too filled up with one particular type of person. 50% of posters suddenly climate deniers? That would be bad. 50% of posters racists? That would be bad. All of a sudden, 50% of posters are liberal progressives making posts about Trump? That would be bad. However, some percentage of people posting here should be outrageously wrong and some percentage of the books and articles you read should be outrageously wrong. I don't think someone is showing intellectual maturity unless they deliberately expose themselves to the occasional outrageously wrong viewpoint. 

When I read, in that comment I read back in December, u/kulmthestatusquo supporting the idea of elites committing child sex abuse I just downvoted it like everyone else and moved on. If there is scum in the world like kulmthestatusquo I should know about it and not be sheltered from it. Maybe he should be reported to the police but I didn't think for a moment to even report THAT post (the worst I've read in this sub) to the mods simply because there's currently only one elite-worshipping, pedo-supporting poster on this sub so it doesn't affect my ability to find good content.

Dennis Meadows himself would come close to being banned from r/collapse. How would the non-white citizens feel about what he said here? Like he/she is just making America weaker? If what diversity_is_racism said is a bannable offense and what Meadows said is not then we need more guidance about what is a bannable offense and what is not.

It is a five minute section starting at 64 min 50 seconds.

active misanthropy to  /R/misanthropy 
By this I mean advocating *for* human extinction as a desirable outcome.

And hatred of children and parents to /r/antinatalism
Without kids we go extinct.  Without kids raised by conscientous well-informed people, how can we expect to ameliorate the mindless overconsumption that is part of the collapse etiology?  Reproducing below the replacement rate is desirable (0, 1, or 2 kids max), and planned reproduction above replacement does have dubious moral justification.  

People can post misanthropic and antinatalist comments to their hearts content on those dedicated subs.  Please just not here since it's not based on fact, and is ultimately divisive and embarrassing to this sub.


I agree with the guidance to operate with empathy.  I'm just not sure how to enforce it beyond rule 8 without censorship that would hamper discussion and create a kind of fear from thought police.

We have cultural issues worldwide, they will differ and require different solutions. Discussions shouldn't be limited to where they go. This is a small sub I've barely contributed to since it started, but I'd like to at least discuss the shitty aspect's of collapse here. Whether they be politically incorrect or not.

Edit: I've checked in every day for years. Don't limit this sub in it's intellectual discussions.","2017-03-28 06:35:12","1","Mahat","1747796487.801397","climate strike","manual"

"dfgxl4z","t3_61rj29","61rj29","collapse","skeptical","Having been lead admin for IIDB (Internet Infidels Discussion Board) and subsequently FRDB (Free Ratio Discussion Board), we used to split out the unwanted off track posts into its own thread or moved them to an unseen by the populace trash compactor. We used a strike system for the users. Five strikes and you're banned, but it depended on how bad or rough any strike was. 
Moderators were given a fairly broad way to mod their sections. When problems or questions arose then, it was kicked to Admin and eventually me, if needed which, was most of the time.
The simplest rule was ""Don't be a poopiehead."" A few examples were listed. Those who became and maintained poopieheadism were given temporary bans and eventually permaban. Some of the examples was ad hom attacks, moving the goal posts to skew the topic, simply going off topic (these were split to its own thread and not really a banable offense). 
This subreddit invokes much feels. No different than IIDB and the endless debating of religion. Emotions run high here. If an OP wants intellectual discussion it MUST be put in the title or OP. This means the examples listed above would not be allowed and deleted. It's fairly easy, but moderation will have to be stepped up. 
If a topic comes up here without the appellation of ""intellectual discussion"" label, then honestly, fair game for everyone...except being a poopiehead. Insults should not allowed here. Give the user three strikes or they're out for 30 days. Two more strike and they're out permanently. Split posts (if they can be split) that go off topic to their own thread. Shit happens and no real need for a ban or strike. 
Being a poopiehead is what your dealing with here. Define what a poopiehead is. Find a system that works, test it and adapt when necessary. This is one subreddit, not IIDB/FRDB with 50+ sections and nearly 100 moderators and 10 Admin and thousands of post per day. Make the rules easy to understand. Make few of them. Give the Mods discretion yet banable offenses a vote by all Mods/Admin. ","2017-03-27 15:12:21","-1","Barbosa003","1747796487.804917","climate strike","manual"
