"cupbig","climatechange","action-oriented","Positive action","It seems that every day the news about the environment is all about gloom and doom.  I would like to create a list of actions/decisions people make every day that make a difference. 

 Over the past few years, I have made small changes in my household hoping to make a difference, however small: I do not use plastic bags, I carry my own water bottle instead of using disposable bottles, I fly only when absolutely necessary (this one is very difficult), I cook at home as much as possible (I go out to dinner once or twice a month) and for the past 4 months I have managed to avoid take out.

I would like to know what other people are doing, climate change is real but I believe it is our small individual daily decision that can create change.","2019-08-24 05:10:37","6","8","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cupbig/positive_action/","True","Humom2dox","1747827779.681349","climate strike","manual"
"cl53c2","environment","emotional","Admittedly silly/impossible hypothetical: What if everybody went on strike against the government at the same time to protest climate change and mandate immediate emergency conversion to a 100% clean energy America?","Thinking at least here in the US: 

- nobody shows up to work at google and other tech firms

- no teachers

- nobody in the White House 

- no cooks

- no delivery people 

- no pilots 

- no cargo ship captains or crew

- no police or military 

Literally 0 people go to work for days or weeks unless/until laws are passed that mandate the immediate, emergency conversion to a 100% clean energy America.

(Ok fine. The few people needed to effect this change could remain at work in the necessary government offices, etc. Just work with me here.)","2019-08-02 14:49:23","5","4","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/cl53c2/admittedly_sillyimpossible_hypothetical_what_if/","True","AutonomousHoag","1747827863.5162282","climate strike","manual"
