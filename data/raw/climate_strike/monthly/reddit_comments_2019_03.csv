Also the networking between people coming together is just as important - or more so- than the immediate attention this action might garner from policy makers. It's a long fight, and gearing up for the long haul means strengthening the ties between allied people in this cause.

"ei337o2","t3_ayroa6","ayroa6","climate","scientific","Suggestions:

- If your town is that small, and turnout likely low - plan on several protests. You absolutely want it PEACEFUL and approachable. Organize this first one - make the contacts, gauge interest. Confirm that you'll be doing the same thing in a month, and to get those people to bring their friends/family. 

- Do it any major intersection with a park. Do NOT block traffic or do a single thing to piss off the public. If you have enough people, have a couple on opposing corners with signs to catch peoples eye. If there's no park, use a parking lot. 

- Around your 2nd or 3rd event, make sure you have literature and research. Cause now you've set a pattern, and if it's at all successful, people will be comfortable with it and will attend simply for camaraderie or to find out more. Sadly, you'll probably get the town skeptic to show up now-abouts (or later), but it will happen that someone will challenge you. 

ALSO - try and have 1-3 proposals. Actual changes you want to see. Low cost, and doesn't ""upset"" anyone. I.e. a community garden. 

Depending on your success, your local paper or station will cover it at some point. This is when you can pitch your suggestions (versus to policy makers directly).
