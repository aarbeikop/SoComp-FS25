[Another has shown](http://theconversation.com/plants-absorb-more-co2-than-we-thought-but-32945) that over the past 110 years some climate models over-predicted the amount of CO2 that remains in the atmosphere, by about 16%.

[Another study](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/rapid-rise-methane-emissions-10-years-surprises-scientists) has shown that melting permafrost has released large amounts of methane.

"db88829","t3_5iha6f","5iha6f","science","scientific","Hey thanks for doing this AMA! This strikes really close to home for me, I live in north west Labrador above the 53rd parallel, very remote area, literally 700 miles in either direction to the next town.

We have a couple of unique features in my area and I'm hoping you can offer some advice.

We have a huge problem with dust. We're located in between two iron ore mines, two very large  ore productions within 2 miles of town.
Their tailings line's have piled up over the last 50 years so basically the entire outline of town is a giant sand pit 

Included a photo for reference. [You can clearly see tailings lines and their proximity to town.](http://imgur.com/FbWRwr4)

One of the mines closed a couple years ago leaving absoutely no upkeep for dust reduction.

And here comes problem number two, 
[the Forrest fire of 2013](http://imgur.com/kvyRyQb)

It's a bit hard to see but on that map but you can see the outline of the tailings sand pits from the previous photo and, in red,the amount of tree cover we lost to that one fire.

So, after spending the last 3 years choked to death with [dust](http://imgur.com/PcoQixp) in the summer time.

And being ""Conveniently"" located in between the two biggest CO2 producers east of Montreal, and with the upcoming changes in the carbon tax pricing

I've been looking at the viability of a Silviculture project to help with 
 
1) dust suppression
2) reforestation 
3) species diversification 
4) local area ascetics 
5) the creation of offset credits

So my questions are

What cold hardy species can be successfully introduced to a boreal forest area, dominated by coniferous trees to improve diversification? 

in regards to dust suppression, I'm assuming a root heavy shrub or bush, perhaps an alder bed might be more effective in retaining top soil material.
In the past they would just hydroseed grass on top, but that requires annual upkeep. Any species in mind that might have a good, fast growing(hopefully not super invasive), tight holding root system to use in between tress?

And honestly, I don't know very much about the creation of offset credits, any experience with this? 

And in regard to asethic, you can see the entire project area from my town, do you know of any diversification projects that had visual appeal for an area in mind during the creation process?  I'd love to look into them

Thanks agian for doing this AMA, look forward to your reply

My question silly at best. As water levels rise what will happen to the forests when there is bow a foot or so of sea water claiming the land. Take Florida for example, North Florida is about 25ft or so above sea level. Will trees just be sticking out of the flooded areas for X years until they die? If they survive (Assuming they are tall enough) will there just be weird tree top ecosystems, all refugees from the ground, sticking out above the waves.
