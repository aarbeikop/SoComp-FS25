I am in my final year of my geography degree, and have been tasked with writing an essay on the school climate strikes. The topic states:

 ""Using two different media organisations (e.g., The Australian vs. The Guardian; international vs. national; online vs. print), compare and appraise the framings applied to the recent worldwide school climate strike issue.""

&#x200B;

I am after suggestions on what would be an interesting media organisation to write on. A lot of people are choosing online news outlets like the ones mentioned in the topic, so I am hoping to do something different. Any ideas?","2019-04-11 23:39:25","1","2","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bc6th8/help_with_essay_on_school_climate_strikes/","True","ArtsStudent1","1747824475.078372","climate strike","manual"
