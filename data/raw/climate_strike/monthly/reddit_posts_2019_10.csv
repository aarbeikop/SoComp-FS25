"dc0sxr","sustainability","action-oriented","After the climate strikes: what do we do now?","For those of you who attended the climate strikes the other week, how do we keep the movement going?

I wrote about a crash course on [why the climate strikes happened](https://www.thegoodstartup.com/post/after-the-climate-strikes-what-comes-next-for-the-6-million-people-movement) and speculate on whether it was successful or not, and there are some really cool articles linked about the things that have happened since the strikes. Hopefully more immediate change with happen soon!","2019-10-01 22:12:53","61","18","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dc0sxr/after_the_climate_strikes_what_do_we_do_now/","True","babbybird","1747831489.727983","climate strike","manual"
"dkaw0r","sustainability","action-oriented","As far as recent climate change protests have gone","As far as I can tell the net effects of the [Global Climate Strike](https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cyjavr/global_climate_strike_920_this_september_millions/) has been nil.  Is there any evidence to the contrary?

This is in line with the net effects of every published paper, international conference, passionate speech, documentary and online comment on doing something about climate change.

Emissions are set to rise short term and long term.  The threat intensifies, the risk for everyone increases and the scale of the disaster expands.  Anything contrary to the immediate phase out of fossil fuels is unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.","2019-10-19 22:39:07","5","2","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dkaw0r/as_far_as_recent_climate_change_protests_have_gone/","True","--_-_o_-_--","1747831563.675073","climate strike","manual"
