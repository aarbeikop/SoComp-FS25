The ruling government's party in NSW, the same one leading the country, defunded emergency services to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The PM has no climate policy whatsoever other than denialism and pushing for increasing coal production. The home affairs minister, who has a creeping amount of worrying power, has suggested along with the PM banning climate protests.

Last couple of days, PM has refused to send extra emergency assistance to augment what is largely a volunteer base, and has said Australia's climate policy is ""getting the results it's supposed to"".

"fadsvds","t3_e8navm","e8navm","climatechange","action-oriented","I am curious if anyone here could explain the fire history in NSW. For the longest time people agressively put out fires in the united states. The last 2 decades tactics have been changing, but areas that we're preserved by fire fighting are starting to light up... When they do it's bad. The timing does not seem worse. We created these tinderboxes and now with higher average temps they seem to be getting that extra boost.

I'm just not sure what we should do. We could agressively start fighting fires again, but I wonder if that would only make things worse. Wildland firefighting is the front line of climate change and we only kind of know what we're doing.

Unrelated, the United States pays our fire fighters shit. They deserve more after having to risk their lives because the world couldn't get it's shit together. 

Good luck down there man. I was close to a giant fire in Manitoba 2 years back and it does look apocalyptic. I never realized why Vietnam movies always showed a blood red sun .... At least I didn't until I saw the sun obscured by wood smoke on a lake.

As an American we pioneered the climate change denial insanity in order to support capitalism and oil companies, and I feel responsible to some degree that it infected other countries. But neoliberalism was already entrenched with Reagan and Thatcher, and this was just a natural outgrowth.

Point being: yes, it's probably too late to avoid more disaster, and more serious disasters, but if you want any progress to be made you've got to throw the right-wing and capitalism out of your country.

Went into the outback and swam in the coral reef before the bleaching (are the fires affecting that at all?), stunning places without a doubt. I've read the largest fire is around the size of Sydney itself and, just wow.

We've had small (in comparison) wild fires on moors (low lying hills) near to Manchester and that made big news here. I've seen the pictures online of Sydney, I sincerely hope those fires are out asap. Best of luck from a friendly pom.","2019-12-10 23:18:14","5","griffaliff","1747833126.83424","climate strike","manual"

That’s other worldly and from the videos I’ve seen from the firefighters over there...

I’d be really scared to be honest.

The real life manifestation of all our fucking with the planet.

I saw another video too of a fire tornado forming too.

We love our weather here in the UK but you guys could just take the biscuit every time with this stuff

I've experienced those days where the light is naught but sepia, and even the dark black shadows seem brown. Hope is hard to find during those times, and I can't even think of how much harder it is for you to find hope when the situation is exponentially worsening.","2019-12-11 00:01:46","3","8bitmadness","1747833126.840859","climate strike","manual"
