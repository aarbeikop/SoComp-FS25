"4x8la2","climate","scientific","Livestock and stripping forests don't contribute to global warming","This is a contrarian view that I now hold, that I'd like an educated person to correct me on if I'm wrong. I mention it because it seems there are a lot of bad arguments which distract from the good ones about climate change.

The thinking goes like this. Carbon that exists above ground gets turned into living things, then back to air, then back to living things. There's not really going to be a big net change in above-ground carbon by planting more, or harvesting more trees, or in/decreasing livestock. Fluctuations, exist of course. And some forms of carbon (eg methane over CO2) are more potent green house gasses. But same amount of carbon will exist in a location where it affects the climate (above ground), and roughly the same green house effect over time.

In my mind, the real issue would then be dredging up sequestered carbon in the form of fossil fuels. This results in a (nigh-irreversible) increase in surface carbon, and a real net increase in green house effects. In my mind, mining is a real issue, where as trees and cattle are less so.

Am I wrong in this line of reasoning?","2016-08-11 15:35:07","0","8","0.4","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/4x8la2/livestock_and_stripping_forests_dont_contribute/","True","BayesMind","1747912837.968072","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
