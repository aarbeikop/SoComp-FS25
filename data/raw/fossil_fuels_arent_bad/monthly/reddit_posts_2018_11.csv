"a1k22c","environment","emotional","Headlines and articles in the Guardian, WaPo, and others somehow interpret the recent UN climate report as though we have 10 to 12 years to do something about climate change. We don't.","E.g. [here](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report), [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/08/world-has-only-years-get-climate-change-under-control-un-scientists-say/), and [here](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report). The UN report does say that by 2030 we need to be at a 45% reduction in fossil fuel use and down to zero by 2050 (for a decent chance at a 1.5 C scenario). However, this does not mean waiting until 2029 and then cutting 45%, which would have catastrophic impacts on human life (and would not be enough anyway because math). It means leveling off use right now and then starting to cut down in the very near future, like 2020. 

In order to reach a 45% reduction over the course of 10 years, you have to cut 5.8% per year. That's already an incredibly big number and would, at least after two to three years likely lead to much misery especially among the most vulnerable due to our dependence on fossil fuels. If you consider that the biggest users should make the biggest cutbacks, then that number goes up for places like the US, Canada, and Australia.

Every year we wait to start cutting or even use weak sauce like the Paris Climate Accords makes this number bigger and implies more misery for more people. We don't have ten years; we have negative years inasmuch as the kind of cuts we need to start making almost immediately are beyond the realm of possibility.
