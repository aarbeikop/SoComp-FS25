"6jki8d","collapse","skeptical","Daily Collapse Links","Each day I get up and focus on collapse for about an hour. Today the focus is on financials and energy - the crypto-currency crash, the gold flash crash, the Japanese bond market freeze, and the bail-in of taxpayers by 2 Italian banks. Most of these gyrations are considered temporary yet they do indicate massive instability. 

Some ""scientists"" tell us we can achieve 100% renewable electrical energy before we collapse, which I say is complete bullshit. They say we can better utilize hydro power at a time that water flows are receding and erratic. They ignore the fact that nuclear plants are so old as to be unsafe and will have to be replaced. Gas and oil use are expected to grow 15% by 2035, but no one talks about how much of that growth will have to come from fracking, which uses massive amounts of water in the face of oncoming shortages. And nobody talks about the mineral constraints on solar and wind power development. When I look online, I see everyone talking about self-driving flying cars like it's a given. People talk of electric cars like as if we can have all the renewable energy we want in the world. China is burning less coal and we are driving less mostly because of the economy, not because we are tree hugging saints. In fact most of the power for electric cars in Europe will come from actually burning trees. 

The 2 biggest fake news stories are energy and finance, both of which are corrupt to the core. You may of heard of the death of Moore's law, but when it comes to debt financing, it appears to be alive and well - and on steroids. All this talk of energy and finance seems to be at the expense of the ecology, which only surfaces when news gets out about how we can't stop poisoning our water. All the talk of a green energy nirvana is totally disconnected from the war in Syria, which is about who will control a gas pipeline to Europe. 

In ten years the super rich will have stolen half our pensions through fraud and half our jobs through robotics. In exchange for that, we are offered war, which is the number one jobs program in the U.S. In ten years we won't need boots on the ground in the middle east, it will be fought by A.I. supersonic drones and miniature A.I. tanks. 

Right now we got an opioid epidemic ravaging the nation, and big pharma decides to jack up the anti-overdose to extortionist heights. I thought I was a bad writer, but Julian Assange has come out with a story about how we're dividing the country into racial/social tribes to accelerate the war agenda. 

Most collapse stories started with gold shills and Green NGOs who wanted to make money. I write about collapse every day because I believe it's happening and not to make money for a book tour or through YouTube monetization. The only reason ads appear on my site is because I'm too cheap to pay the $10/year it takes to get rid of them.
