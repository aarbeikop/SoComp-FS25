Fossil fuels are, of course finite so to extend our fossil fuel use, because they were suffering the affects of declining EROI, we invented “renewable” energy devices, that are of course built and maintained with fossil fuels. 

That’s where you went wrong, assuming renewables could replace all fossil fuels, continue growth, maintain BAU and feed seven and a half billion ravenous apes. Renewables are helping though, they are allowing us to burn less coal but still burn nearly 4 billion tonnes annually, we don’t burn less gas and we don’t burn less oil. We have a massive power grid built with fossil fuels,  that wind mills and solar panels feed into and destabilise. Lucky we have nuclear, hydro and coal to stabilise the disruption.  No, renewables won’t be replacing FF’s anytime soon. Especially if 7.5B people want to continue living.","2017-11-03 04:34:52","2","Bandits101","1747928470.402224","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

I think the author is being way too optimistic, but it does look like their predictions about EV pricing falling will be true.  I'd imagine one of the main obstacles would be the lack of charging stations spread out across the nation, though existing gas stations could implement them?  I don't know enough about this to make a conclusion.","2017-11-07 15:15:56","3","Liquid_Blue7","1747928811.2887921","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

Additionally, EVs have an expected lifespan of 1 million miles. By 2022, the low-end models will be sold for as low as $20,000.
