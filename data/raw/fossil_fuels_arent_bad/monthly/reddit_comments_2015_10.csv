"cw3fwf9","t3_3p5pcb","3p5pcb","collapse","skeptical","> We've been making the assumption that the wealthy and powerful have been acting out of stupidity and greed, but what if they've actually been facing up to the reality of the situation? What if the survival of a fraction of the 1% is the best that we could ever have hoped for, and the history of the past sixty years is them desperately trying to kick the can down the road far enough that some of us would have the technology to be able to survive the impending armageddon?

The ""impending armageddon"", as you put it, was never inevitable. You are talking about the people who in large part control society and determine how much of our resources are used. If they were serious about making an effort to mitigate the effects of climate change, they would have issued very loud warnings about this as soon as they became aware of the danger, then they would've suggested we begin pouring enormous resources into developing the technologies that would allow our society to adapt, and furthermore they would've lobbied for that as well. But they didn't do that, as evidenced by the amount of time and resources that were and still are being wasted.

I sincerely mean no offense, but your theory is a fantasy. The relevant parties who knew of the danger but did nothing, I suspect the real reasons for their actions are some combination of the following:

* They didn't give a fuck. They'll live rich and powerful, they'll die rich and powerful, and after that it doesn't matter to them because they're dead.

* Maybe they thought jesus was gonna come and save everybody anyway. Lots of people believe this shit, so that wouldn't be too surprising.

* They don't value human life, except for their own, and their descendants, who they think will come out ok. 

* Denial. They deny that there is anything they can do to make a difference, even though they are already doing things that have been making a big difference for the worse. This one is similar to your rather charitable notions, but it is not the same because the truth, really, is that had substantial action been taken sooner (not even necessarily way way way sooner, but even just, say 25 years ago) the future could look a whole lot better than it does now.

"cw3fptk","t3_3p5pcb","3p5pcb","collapse","skeptical","I've played with explanatory models like this, but I can't get them to perfectly fit. Gambling with the climate, oceans, pollution, and mass extinctions because of unmitigated population growth seems too dumb to fathom. I understand the urge to make these models. Our collective behavior is insane. Why? That's what we're driven to figure out.

Having a small population could be an advantage. They could be highly educated and have a lot of leisure, and they wouldn't use up a lot of resources. Our education systems are deliberately terrible, so what's the point of having so many people? Technology could have grown much faster in the context of a smaller intelligent society versus a massive consumerist one. This technology advancement could only have helped the oligarchs even more - allowing more options for survival and mitigation/prevention of crises.

I haven't figured out why things got to this point though I'm still working on it. I know that evolution has played a large part in the stratification of our species through psychology more than ""intelligence"". I can't determine if oligarchical psychology is producing any rational long-term planning. They could have easily stopped things from getting to this state - they control the information channels and can easily shape the public. They didn't, and now we face what's likely going to be the darkest point in human history. Perhaps this is even the beginning of the end.

It would have taken large-scale collective efforts to deal with major existential threats to our species. You can't have a world of chaos where billions are dying, burning insane amounts of resources in desperation, and be able to deal with asteroids, new diseases, and any number of other unlikely but inevitable things.

Makes no rational fucking sense at all currently. ","2015-10-17 23:32:38","16","EntropyAnimals","1747904148.7125309","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

"cvtv3kz","t3_3o3t02","3o3t02","collapse","skeptical","More accurately: Green Energy that enables a continuation of the status quo is utter bullshit.   

Green Energy in a reduced energy state of living is probably something not entirely bullshit.   The mistake is to think that the status quo can magically be extended by it.  It can't.  It's peoples attachment to the status quo that is fail.

Similarly suburbia and cars are bullshit and unsustainable.

Over in /r/singapore there was soon-to-become ex-pat this week asking about how people managed to own a car since it's so expensive - especially since her idea of ""a necessary car"" was a Caddie Escalade.  She was ""concerned"" about how she was going to get one into SG and operate it.

She was politely informed (well I tried as much I could - others chimed in similarly) of the reality of Singapore (and it's the reality throughout much of Asia) that owning/driving a car isn't even in the realm of normal - public transit is so good in Singapore that it's simply crazy to even consider one, let alone an SUV monster.  And it's a relief to abandon the financial and mental commitment of having a car.  

And places where one must drive, you want a local doing the driving anyway - traffic is too insane and different as are liability laws; but hiring a driver is cheap: Asia has a different prioritization for ""Machine/Energy vs. Human"" labor.  Human labor trumps machines/energy more often than not because of the abundance of the former.  You don't see the mad rush to ""automate"" and ""mechanize"".  There's more often a choice to use human labor for things that are blindly automated in the US out of ideology and greed more than need and social harmony.

I bring this up because she was a perfect example of how people are locked into a singular mindset (especially Americans).  For her the issue was partly familiarity and partly a misunderstanding of safety (apparently she drives an Escalade in the US for personal safety) and partly ignorance of ""most of the world that isn't the US"".  

Yet, again, in much of Asia, it's perfectly safe for a woman to walk the streets in the dead of night or ride public transit, which is an alien experience for the US especially since 9-11.  And most of the assumptions people in the US take for granted are not quite the same: labor vs. energy is a big one.

Hopefully this woman will move to SG and see an alternate reality to the status quo of the US and get a glimmer of the insight needed to see that ""the US way"" is neither the best way nor the only way that works.  Hopefully she'll share that with others when she returns to the US and maybe more will see ""the truth"" of many things currently ignored by willful ignorance.","2015-10-09 16:51:47","12","mantrap2","1747904570.411366","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

In a nutshell you are right, renewable energy isn´t capable to sustain an industrial economy. But why should it? An industrial economy is a wasteful monster that is sure to get a haircut.

When told that green tech has drastically lower EROI ratios than fossil fuels, a moronic user just kept vaguely moaning about how those same technologies were sustainable without a suitable explanation as to how they could be sustained. 


The thought of living without a continous connection to the electrical grid terrifies people, and I can't necessarily blame them for that. But they all seem to fail to realize that billions are living like that today in the 3rd world. They've become so obsessed with preserving the idea of their affluent lifestyles that the thought of having to change their lifestyles doesn't even register. They're going to be in for a world of pain when the grid starts to fail with more regularity. ","2015-10-09 21:55:24","8","[deleted]","1747904570.416179","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

A gang came to rob the village bank, and they did, but before escaping with the loot, they herded all the bank staff and the many customers into the vault and shut it tight. Within their tomb of hardened steel, the hapless crowd understood that they would soon consume all of the available oxygen and asphyxiate. Any activity would hasten their end, so they sat quietly, not stirring, except for nervous fidgeting, praying that someone would come and deliver them from their dire predicament. As the hours stretched long, and the air grew stale, most of them lost hope. However, some were willing to do what was necessary to survive. Three days later, when the vault opened, only those pitiless few stepped outside.
