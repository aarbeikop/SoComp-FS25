"7ah0pw","environment","emotional","In my late teens (circa 1997) I truly believed we'd evolve beyond fossil fuels in my lifetime. Now I'm sadly convinced we won't. What I predict will happen is much, much worse.","Scarcity leads to innovation. It's ingenious what we can devise when we want something badly enough.  I wanted a piece of the ride so I studied the politics of our environment.  I did my undergrad in poli sci/enr, and worked into renewable energy. When the market tanked in 2008 I went back to school and worked in sustainability.  I always knew that the powers that be wouldn't let go of their fossil kingdom easily.  I'm watching things unfold and it's hard to see any mid-term future without resource scarcity, mind-boggling income stratification, and skyhigh prices for everyday things. Its referred to as a novel state. Its a status that may resemble its former state (like the 90's), but has noticeable degraded.  Kinda scary.

I knew the power of fossil fuels would put up a good fight, but this Rick Perry thing is a new low.  Fossil fuels will put a stop to the rape/abuse culture, eh?  Nice try buddy. He looks like he's rolling. Anyhow, amidst all this choas there is some pretty innovative and cool stuff happening out there. 

tl:dr I was young and hopeful once. Then I got educated and am quite afraid.
