Forest clearance (e.g. Amazon and Indonesian rainforests initially logged for timber, then used to grow crops, then abandoned because the soil is not stable once its protective canopy of trees and plants are removed, turning it to desert. You only have to stand in the shade of a tree to feel the temperature is cooler than in the shade of a building, due to transpiration. Also Google map the island of Haiti / Dominican Republic to see what deforestation for timber and agriculture does to land.

Western agriculture (monoculture) involves huge inputs of fertilisers, pestisides all of which are made from fossil fuels or mined; add to that fuel to manufacture huge machinery from steel and fuel to use the machinery to harvest grain, much of which is fed to methane-producing livestock at a ratio of around 7:1 - huge carbon footprint. Much agriculture relies on irrigation, depleting rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Add to that loss of biological diversity, increasing diseases and plant predation (World wide, the cotton boll weevil, aphids, locusts and other plagues of pests), leading to greater use of pesticides. Transporting the products of agriculture around the world uses marine diesel, lorry diesel or aviation fuel (lamb from New Zealand to UK, avocados from Chile etc) Then consider the billions of tonnes of wasted food - 7.3 million tonnes in UK in 2015 and it will be more now, most of which ends up in landfill, emitting methane gas (30 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere). And this is just scratching the surface!!!","2018-08-07 17:25:34","6","WendyJK","1747939465.574264","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"e3t15k1","t3_95csky","95csky","climatechange","action-oriented","To answer your question about the carbon cycle... Yes, there is a constant amount of carbon on earth and it pretty much doesn't change. However, it's not carbon itself that causes global warming it is the greenhouse gases that have carbon in them that causes it. For example, CO2 : 1 carbon and 2 Oxygen is a molecule that is in our atmosphere. The more CO2 we have in the atmosphere, the hotter our atmosphere gets.

The good news is that at some point CO2 gets absorbed by plants and is used to make their leaves and trunks. This takes time as plants can only take back so much CO2 per day.

Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas) sit underground for millions of year and is relatively harmless. It's when we use them that they become bad when burning oil/gas causes CO2 to be expelled into the atmosphere. Ever since the industrial revolution, we have been burning these fossil fuels at such a fast rate that our forests (which are also being cut down) can not keep up with the pace and can't suck in CO2 fast enough.

Jungles are being burnt down and used for agriculture. For example, palm plantations in Indonesia. This causes problems in several ways:

1. Jungles are much more efficient at absorbing CO2 than palm plantations because of the density of jungles and their undergrowth.
2. The act of burning jungles releases CO2 into the atmosphere at much quicker rates than they would if they died naturally.
3. More CO2 in the atmosphere means more heating of the atmosphere

Not all agriculture is bad but here are some that are bad:

1. Cattle release methane (farts and burps) which is 30 times more potent than CO2 as a heat trapping gas. In general, meat and dairy has a much higher carbon footprint than vegetables and fruits. This knowledge is partly causing the vegan trend.
2. Mass agriculture means that the food they produce has to be shipped all around the country in trucks. If people bought local, there would be much less gas used.
3. Food has to be stored, packaged, shipped, processed, transported, prepared and served. At every stage, these release greenhouse gases because every stage uses energy from fossil fuels. Of course this can be all fixed if we suddenly switched to renewable energy like solar, wind, hydro and geothermal.

Of course we all need agriculture for food. We just have to be smart about it.","2018-08-08 03:55:10","4","notoriouslysmall","1747939465.580396","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

For example in grain farming, the mass of grains you get far surpasses the mass of fuel you put in but I never hear about grain farming being carbon negative and I don't know why.","2018-08-07 15:56:06","2","[deleted]","1747939465.583028","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"e3romgk","t3_95csky","95csky","climatechange","action-oriented","The two arguments I've seen are:

- Cows make methane, which is a more powerful GHG than CO2. (Missing from this claim is the fact that CH4 degrades to CO2 pretty quickly.)

- Agriculture takes lots of fossil fuels at every stage of production and transportation. (Of course there is nothing but crickets when you ask people how they plan to get food without using lots of energy.)","2018-08-07 16:01:51","1","Will_Power","1747939465.585064","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"e3s3jk1","t3_95csky","95csky","climatechange","action-oriented","In addition to fuel burnt in tractors and trucks, modern agriculture depends on fertilizers and pesticides  that are largely made from natural gas and other petroleum products.  Maybe 10% of the total there.  Urban gray and black waste could cover most of this need except that it is currently too toxic to use as farm fertilizer.  

Something like 30% of edible food ends up in the waste stream. Just cutting that in half would be a significant impact.  Approval of irradiating food and getting sane ""expiration dates"" on packaged food would be two good steps.  Another would be to use more recyclable packaging.","2018-08-07 19:18:53","1","crashorbit","1747939465.587438","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

"e3trs58","t3_95csky","95csky","climatechange","action-oriented","*Animal* agriculture has more of a detrimental effect on the environment than non-animal agriculture. Here's how animal agriculture negatively affects the environment:

* [Animal agriculture's impact on climate change](https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/animal-agricultures-impact-on-climate-change/): The average American diet, beef consumption creates 1,984 pounds of CO2e annually. Replacing beef with plants would reduce that figure 96 percent, bringing it down to just 73 pounds of CO2e.
* [Here's How America Uses Its Land](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/): Agriculture takes up about a fifth of the country's land, with most of that land being used for pasture/range, livestock feed crops and corn crop for ethanol production.
* [Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock](http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3437e/i3437e00.htm): 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions, or 7.1 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, can be attributed to the livestock sector annually

As for the renewable cycle you asked about, more CO2 is being added to the atmosphere than it being taken out. For example, the forests that would usually absorb the CO2 and produce oxygen are being cut down and cleared to raise methane-producing livestock like cattle. [These forests are not being replaced](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/this-is-how-animal-agriculture-causes-deforestation/) at the same rate they are being cleared.

"e522v30","t3_9bc1q4","9bc1q4","climate","scientific","> I’ll leave you with what seems to me to be a very hopeful alternative. If we could make hydrogen gas (H2) from water (bacteria do it and, on a small scale, we can too), we could take that H2 and burn it with oxygen to make energy and water, which we could remake into hydrogen gas as a never-ending, nonpolluting source of energy. No CO2 in the equation. 

This was something that people looked at quite a bit about 15 years ago.  GM even built a [hydrogen-powered truck for then-governor-of-California Arnold Schwarzenegger to drive](https://newatlas.com/go/3378/), and there were several hydrogen-fueled bus demonstration projects. They generally turned out to be quite expensive to operate, and battery-electric systems have come to dominate the zero-emissions vehicle market.","2018-08-29 20:39:41","2","silence7","1747939508.3025632","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
