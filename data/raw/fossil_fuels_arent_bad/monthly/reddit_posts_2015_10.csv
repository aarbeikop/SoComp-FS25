What the fuck?

Because seriously, this makes no sense. If you find out you're selling poison, and the poison is going to kill everyone including you, you stop selling it. There are no profits that are worth death. And even death deferred a few generations isn't worth short-term profits. You'd have to be a colossal idiot to continue along a business as usual course under those circumstances, and the wealthy and powerful aren't universally stupid. Plus, it's a narrative that conveniently excuses them from all responsibility. I think there's something else going on.

There's only one explanation I can come up with. By the time we knew about all of this, it was already too late.

We had [Gilbert Plass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Plass) warning us about CO2 back in the 50s, there were [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Plundered_Planet) about the [population crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vogt) on the bestseller list in the 40s. We knew there was an [imminent famine](https://deeplythinking.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/1966-famine-in-india/) building up in India, and [fifteen million people starved to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine) in China between 1958 and 1961. We're supposed to believe that the wealthy and powerful all just decided to bury their heads in the sand for the whole [history of climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science) and [population pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population) and ignore what was obviously on around them, even though they make their fortunes by investing while trying to anticipate the future. The current narrative, that all of them were equally stupid and blindly ignorant is satisfying at a visceral level, but it's frankly impossible.

I think a lot of them the wealthy and powerful are pretty smart, and they're usually rational people with understandable motivations. Most of them don't ignore science habitually. I think some of them looked into the upcoming crises. I think they found out that billions of people were going to die, and there was nothing they could do about it.

From here in the 2010s, with the fog of obfuscation clearing, it's become pretty obvious to us too. The idea that we can support this huge population boom that's the direct result of the oil we learned how to refine [back in 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_petroleum_industry#Modern_history) after the oil runs out is ludicrous. We'd need some alternative energy source that's incredibly cheap. Combine that with the environmental impact of the population, and it's pretty obvious that shit is going to go horribly wrong at some point in the future. Any solutions that can be put in place require world peace, and a central government that can pass down strict controls on population and energy use, and they knew exactly what would happen if anyone tried that kind of power grab.

When businesspeople see huge problems, they see huge opportunities. I think they contracted studies, and hired researchers, and the numbers came back hopeless. A hockey stick curve, then a crash. They calculated the world's exponential population growth, which was perfectly predictable, and the output of CO2, also perfectly predictable, and they came to the same conclusions we have, sixty years ago.

At some point in the future, billions of people are going to die, and there's nothing we can do about it.

It reframes the question. If the death of the vast majority of the human population is inevitable, then you have to start looking at the survival of the species.

I think they tried. Looking back at the history of the 20th century from this perspective, it makes a certain amount of sense. The population of industrialized nations were [whipped into a frenzy of consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self) to drive them to new heights of productivity, and therefore progress, with new scientific advancements coming out at ever-inceasing rates. The space program was rushed into being because there was a whole universe of resources out there that might save our hides, but that turned out to be a wash. They thought [nuclear energy was going to solve everything](https://gailtheactuary.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/hubbert-_nuclear_fossil-fuel-to-50001.png?), but that turned out to be more problematic than they'd imagined. [China's one-child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy) was an attempt to see if population controls could make a diffence, and the answer was kind of, and at a huge price, and in an authoritarian state. Meanwhile, all they had to do to keep people from seeing the approaching apocalypse was to cast a pall of dubiousness on environmental science by associating them with the hippie movement and trotting out a few lunatics with doctorates whenever people started getting worried.

Think about the solutions that are currently being proposed; renewable energy, indoor farming, electric cars, automation. They don't scale. An economy based on these technologies won't support billions. With advanced enough technology, our species can survive even if our planet becomes uninhabitable. We can't all survive, of course, but the more technology we have, the better the chances that some of us will make it. 

We've been making the assumption that the wealthy and powerful have been acting out of stupidity and greed, but what if they've actually been facing up to the reality of the situation? What if the survival of a fraction of the 1% is the best that we could ever have hoped for, and the history of the past sixty years is them desperately trying to kick the can down the road far enough that some of us would have the technology to be able to survive the impending armageddon?

I'm not proposing some overarching conspiracy to keep this from the public. I think anyone can look at this situation from a strategic perspective and come to this conclusion fairly quickly. The difference is that the people in power knew they didn't have any tricks up their sleeve to save everybody. We kept waiting for them to wake up and do something, but they were already awake and working away. Every bit of progress we've made in the last half-century has been another step towards our race's self-sufficiency and survival.

At the cost of billions of lives.

But when the population is the problem, what's the solution? If you implement population control and the countries around you don't, you're at a tremendous strategic disadvantage a generation down the road. Is it better for billions of people to die, or for them never to have existed? But the bottom line is, if you start putting downward pressure on the population, you impact your nation's productivity. And the race is depending on that productivity to fuel the science we need to survive.

The wealthy and powerful are going to build settlements in isolated places, hardened against the environment, using the technologies we've developed in manufacturing, materials science, energy, automation, and defense, and they're going to create self-sufficient enclaves which should be able to survive no matter how bad things get. They're just about ready. They'll take digitized copies of all our literature, our art, our music and our media, they'll take memories of us on Twitter and Facebook, and they'll mourn for us as the death of our planet consumes us. But if they've been smart about this, they'll live on, and in a few generations they may have even figured things out well enough to get back into space, and use their life-support tech to expand.

TL;DR: The only way that the history of the past half a century makes any sense to me at all is if the wealthy and powerful have known that collapse was inevitable this whole time, and they've been kicking the can down the road as far and as hard as they could this whole time, hoping that technology would allow us some small percentage of us to survive.","2015-10-17 21:42:50","53","75","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/3p5pcb/the_wealthy_and_powerful_have_known_about_the/","True","MrVisible","1747904144.777525","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"3o3t02","collapse","skeptical","Green Energy Is 100% Bull Shit","In 2007, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2015 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

In 2014, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2030 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

The IPCC says we can make this change because of what they call ""negative-emissions bio-energy"". meaning we will get energy by consuming plant matter in a way that pulls more CO2 out of the air than it emits; for which, by the way, no such technology exists, and the kicker is, they say, that we will need 1.5 billion acres of NEW farmland to do it. That much farmland is about the size of India, which is equal to nearly 50% of all the arable land on earth. 

The acronym for this fantasy is BECCS (Bio-Energy Carbon Capture & Storage). The real acronym is BS (Bull Shit). Where do you think we'll find all this new farmland? The rainforests. World hunger will guarantee it.

Because we add 1 MILLION PEOPLE TO EARTH EVERY 5 DAYS (each who would very much like to eat every day for at least 50 years), we will have to grow more food over the these next 50 years than we grew in all of the last 10,000 years, combined. This is called math, get used to it, it will rule your life. We already converted nearly half the earth's surface into cities and farmland. Do you seriously believe 9 billion people will stop eating meat and wasting food? Yet, Scientific American says humans only have 60 years of agriculture left if we continue to lose and degrade soil at current rates. And climate change only guarantees faster soil degradation rates.

To feed nine billion people all at once for all their lives means we will need 12 million acres of brand new farmland EVERY year for 30 years. Instead, we are losing 24 million acres of farmland EVERY year. We are losing soil at twice the rate we need to grow it just to be able to eat, never mind the additional requirements of BECCS.

In 10 years 4 billion people will be without enough water.

In 10 years 2 billion people will be severely short of water.

Over the next 50 years energy demand will double (at the same time we have to reduce emissions at least 50%) because over 2 billion rural refugees will move to cities, and 75% of the infrastructure they require does not even exist yet. Already, China has poured more concrete in the last few years than the U.S.A. has in all of the last 100 years. Concrete production is a super-emitter of carbon into the air. 

Yet, it also takes 10 times the amount of rated intermittent energy to close one fossil fuel plant simply because renewable energy is intermittent and fossil energy is not. It will be a physical impossibility to meet all future demand with 100% renewable energy and reduce emissions all at the same time. 50% of the renewable power in Europe comes from burning imported wood from all over the world. Rainforests are slashed and burned in South America and Indonesia to grow soy and palm oils that are exported Europe to burn in German diesel cars, who then lie about their emissions.

We cannot meet a doubling of energy demand using the lower power density and intermittency solar and wind technologies provide. These products only last some 30 years and use more minerals per unit of power. Recycling their alloys will use more energy and cost more than mining for them in the first place costs.
We constantly lie to ourselves about how bad it is. We lie to ourselves about how smart we are. We lie to ourselves about how stupid we are.

You can tell these reality based facts to Naomi Klein and Joe Romm until you are blue in the face. Nothing will change their mind because they lie. It's that fucking simple.
