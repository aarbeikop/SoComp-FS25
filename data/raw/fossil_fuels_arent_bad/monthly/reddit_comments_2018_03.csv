"dw1vmkk","t3_862lue","862lue","collapse","skeptical","I think it's important to realize that what constitutes a city for an industrial society isn't the same as for an unindistrialized one.

In medieval Europe places with as little as 10,000 people were 'cities' and had fortifications and political independence. With a few notable exceptions like Angor Wat, Rome, or Tenochtitlan they just didn't get all that big. So the 'city' provided the safety in numbers and a means of defense, while the peasants of the surrounding countryside provided the city dwellers with food.

So in a post-collapse scenario, I would imagine that the small, compact, walkable towns that have some productive countryside around them, and some remaining social cohesion, would do better than the glorified lone homesteader from American folklore.

Any big cities are fucked of course, especially the sprawling ones.","2018-03-21 15:11:47","15","NorthernTrash","1747930665.488905","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

So I just kinda enjoy the benefits of modern life, and I don't pay too much attention to what is sustainable or not because in the end I live in a third world hellhole and even if I became a martyr and lived in a hut or something, people in the developed world would still do their best to consume 50 times as much resources as I do.","2018-03-21 16:17:50","13","[deleted]","1747930665.49152","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"dw1xysy","t3_862lue","862lue","collapse","skeptical","I'm totally anti-civ. I mean, think of it this way: Cities are loads of humans in one place who do not farm, but continue to eat. When you're eating, you're fucking and popping out kids. Then the city's population grows, and like a parasite, sucks the nutrients out of the soils surrounding the city. Once the population increases enough, more farmland is needed - as well as conquest, deforestation, and a social hierarchy between farmers and non-farmers, landowners and farm workers, etc. This keeps going until empires come into existence and utilize the form of transit that is most efficient to facilitate large-scale interregional or global trade (and warfare) until either the central government collapses or the farmland turns to desert and ecological collapse ensues.

Our age is an interesting one because oil has sped both the political and ecological collapse up to the point where both are happening simultaneously at some of the fastest speeds recorded. ","2018-03-21 15:46:50","10","[deleted]","1747930665.494003","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

For getting things like advanced, efficient R&D you need as a dense environment as possible. You would have a very hard time to greenfield something in a region with no population nor infrastructure. As a corollary, once such dense environments are no longer viable R&D will be hard and likely cease/slow down to a trickle.","2018-03-21 16:55:11","10","eleitl","1747930665.4964721","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"dw1wsh5","t3_862lue","862lue","collapse","skeptical","It is easier for a city-dweller to use fewer resources.   

In the middle of the countryside, everything has to travel further to get to you, or you have to travel further to get stuff, and there isn't the opportunity to obtain and exchange second-hand goods on the same scale (without making use of the postal service. People won't travel 10 miles to get small bits and pieces on Freecycle.) It's less sustainable getting fuel supplies out there; in the UK heating oil is still widely used, although well-off people renovating their homes increasingly install heatpumps. There isn't enough wood for everyone to use it as the main fuel, and it is also worse for air pollution, which a lot of people don't realise. The heat island effect in cities means people ought to need less fuel, although there are some bloody freezing badly insulated cheaply built properties in cities. Growing food on an individual basis in gardens uses more resources than getting it from farms - but people from this board are doing it for self-sufficiency reasons, not because they assume it's green in itself.            

You have a romanticised view of people in the countryside - the caring-about-nature view you describe is more characteristic of downshifting lefty incomers than the average lifelong rural population (in Britain and the US). Land etc is still a resource to be used - but people do care about scenery, i.e. opposition to wind turbines is frequent.      

It's not something I'm going to vote up or down on because I know the gut-level preference for the countryside, connection to nature etc. It's a heart versus head thing, modernist versus romantic forms of environmentalism. And if people consider economic instability, criminal/political unrest as issues, they are going to want to be further from cities and able to grow food for themselves.     

I also don't subscribe to this 'last hope' idea.

Or at least, overshot much more slowly (Easter Island, I guess).  

I've been to NYC twice, once when I was 10 and once when I was 24; when I was a kid it was naive awe of ""wow, this is one of the great places that makes the world turn!"", but last year it was ""wow, this is one of the Ozymandias-esque dirty death traps that allows people to think the ocean won't be knocking on their door in the next ten years if another 9/11 event doesn't kill us all first.""

I think collapse will be both imminent and medium descent-ish and humanity will regress several hundred years but not go extinct, and that human nature to gather and be social will cause pre-industrial cities to once again sprout in the aftermath, but forever lacking the energy allowed by fossil fuels to become truly cancerous growths.  For me, the ideal fantasy would be if enough people woke up now, to salvage ""green energy"" technology and *appropriate technology* to at least make these supposed retro-future cities somewhat comfortable than their 1700s counterparts.","2018-03-21 17:07:50","7","liatrisinbloom","1747930665.505833","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

They are hellishly wasteful and overpopulated now, but on the other hand they are attractive magnets for the bulk of humanity. This will ensure they become massive death traps when outside resources cannot sustain them anymore. All those bodies and the decaying infrastructure will make great habitat for a variety of creatures large and small. Even trees can break through the concrete and turn roads and  town centers into streams and ponds again. Look at the growth of kudzu over skyscrapers in a relatively short timespan. Those building provide excellent support to growths beyond normal for such plants. Maybe even the sunken cities of certain regions of the world may serve as the stop game communities of remaining ocean wildlife going forward. Serving as a kind of manmade coral community that small animals can live within and on. The toxins flooded up in those same waters will make all the wildlife too toxic to eat and the crumbling infrastructure will make those areas too dangerous to exploit. Humans will be forced to leave them alone for thousands of years. A few smaller, wealthier subsections of cities may survive as bubble societies and will still perform many of the same functions as older cities but in a more compact, lower energy use, not overpopulated, and largely self sufficient way.

TLDR: Cities are terrible for the environment now but may serve as a rich source of resources and homes for hardy wildlife in the future. The consumption ratio will flip and certain wildlife (vermin, weeds, pests) will flourish at the expense of man.

Just try to establish the groundwork for a revolution over time and drop out of the system as much as you can. Unfortunately you have to wait for things to get bad enough for the political climate to make revolution possible to sustain.

History shows plenty of examples where things flip over in crazy historical turning points. Once the USA cracks up the rest of the world has much more room to move. Maybe it will all be too little too late.
