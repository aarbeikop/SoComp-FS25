"862lue","collapse","skeptical","[META] Curious - how do collapse subscribers feel about cities?","I posted something recently as a comment in line with a thread about how 'bad Phoenix is' as the 'world's least sustainable city', and I responded with a few-sentence response about how I view that cities themselves are essentially all unsustainable now, and that human empire is unsustainable, and increasingly, it is at the site of the city where the worst of it occurs, and I got downvoted heartily. 

I'm curious how /r/collapse feels about _The City_ as a concept. Because we as a sub don't always agree about ""what is collapse worthy"" but we generally, here, anyway, seem to agree that: 

1.) Overpopulation contributes to collapse. 

2.) Lifestyle contributes to collapse. (Though we might disagree about what aspects of that, but in broad strokes people talk about driving, eating meat, and so forth - I'd add in _using heat or cooling_, wearing synthetic fibre clothing, living in a structure made with materials that are not local to you, eating food you grew in place that relied upon any chemical whatsoever, and so forth)

3.) That Peak Oil is a real thing and contributes to rising energy costs, but that using that energy to techno-fix the problem we created by using half of all of the oil is shooting ourselves in the foot.

4.) That climate change represents an enormous existential threat for humans and much of the life on the planet. 

... It would seem to me that most subscribers here would generally agree with those four things. Too many of us, living too-material-dependent lifestyles, on fossil fuels which are getting harder to get, and that us using that energy has created nearly-runaway climate change. 

So I was practically shocked to see so many downvotes on a comment criticizing cities. Now, it could have been my delivery. I'm not always that diplomatic. But, I'm genuinely curious where the disagreement is nested. 

It would seem to me that people are loathe to criticize ""cities"", where people live in close proximity to each other, and generally speaking, use resources that were not obtained locally, to live. There's a whole movement of New Urbanism (with lots of argument that it should just be ""Urbanism"") where people think that if you ride bicycles and walk and take the train, and if you live in a condo tower, you're no longer part of the problem. People deeply believe that densely populated urban areas with little places to sip cappuccino while you sit on your Macbook Air, working as a free-lance marketing vlogger, is basically the pinnacle of existence, and _oh, so sustainable_. 

My argument is that cities are the sites that promote a bunch of problems. Because essentially all the food people consume in a city come from outside the city, it creates a false sense of holistic security, wherein city dwellers don't care where their bacon or vegan textured soy protein, came from, because they just trust that something organic will be in the supermarket each and every day. They don't think much about where the water comes from that comes out of the tap. They don't think about the billions of litres of medicated human faeces, or where it goes (hint, right back in the river, or ocean, with minimal treatment). If 90% of the world lived like the _most frugal, most minimalistic_ people in cities, we'd need multiple Earths to get all the material and food for the city dwellers to live. Being a city-dwelling person removes your consciousness from some of the more poignant realities of the effect of Human Empire, because we're surrounded by ads, lights, 24/7 food outlets, retail opportunities, and all kinds of other falsities. 

I thought that this was a pretty straightforward comment. So, there's disagreement perhaps from some or many of you, but I'd like to know what, and why. Maybe even I'll change my mind. But, I am wrapped around the axle of wonder - given the pillars of collapse that we generally agree to on this sub, how can so many people find the concept of ""the city"", so ""sustainable""? Or, do many of you generally agree that cities are, now at least, or especially, unsustainable ventures? Is the concept of ""The Sustainable City"" something that some of you have been clinging to as your last hope, beyond which there is nothing but a slippery cognitive dissonance slope down into accepting the reality of what this sub is talking about?

"85zj0a","collapse","skeptical","I'm so fucking stuck on where to go or what to do.","So I'm unbelievably upset about the whole biosphere destruction and now the Cambridge Analytica thing on top of that. Despite knowing it's a *long* shot for our species now, I *really* want to see us making it *at least* into the next century. I want us to be able to look back collectively laugh and cry at how damn stupid we used to be, like we do now with WW1. *I want to ensure that we survive.* The alternative just depresses me far too much to think about.

However, knowing how selfish, lazy, and ignorant humans generally are by nature as well as how manipulated we are by the elites puppeting social/other mass media, I no longer believe we can save ourselves through democratic processes. We-I'm specifically from the US, but this applies to the entire globe, pretty much-*need* a violent, armed coup to topple our government and replace it with an authoritarian strong-council that'd listen to experts and advisors and **firmly lay down and enforce** orders to forcibly re-align the US and hopefully by extension the world to live in a matter that's sustainable for our biosphere. There *will* be much suffering and a decent amount of death (suicide, legalizing postnatal abortions by the parents up to the 2nd birthday, and executions of the fossil-fuel, etc. elites in addiiotn to I think Mark Zuckerberg at this point), but hopefully things would turn out better for us long-term-and there would actually *be* a long-term, maybe!-than they would have had we simply kept living as we do now. I so *badly* want to help out in installing this new chance at collective survival, to be loved, to have my name in history books, to have there even *be* history books a hundred years from now. Yes, I'm a selfish bastard and I know it.

The main way I'd be able to do this is by converting people to this philospophy, enlisting in the military, converting fellow servicemembers, and then attacking the capital and headquarters of multiple companies including FB. The issue with that is... 1) The idea of being shot down on my first attack raid and going down in waht little history's left as a stupid traitor scares the shit out of me, 2) I don't know how well I would do in the military, and if I could be able to fly my own planes or run my own equipment, 3) I've had suicidal ideation and violent mood swings my entire life, and worry about my ability to hide those so I can stay in the military long enough to help take over the US government, and most of all 4) I don't know how I can spread this idealogy and specific planning wihtout people taking me into custody for being mentally unstable, for being treasonous, or both. 

This has been completely eating at me for weeks. I am so far   behind in at least one of my classes for dwelling on the collapse and how to prevent/deal with it instead of doing homework, whcih just seems so dull and useless by comparison. What's really crazy is that I've talked to one of my old professors, who's a *really* smart and rational lady from England, about this and she not only thought it was seriously interesting, but she also thinks there's at least a bit of validity to my thought processes on governing our country. As she pointed out to me, ""tyrant"" wasn't originally a negative term when it was invented by the ancient Greeks. She and I agreed that it's really more a matter of trusting a single person or a very small group with the future of your country versus trusting millions of people with the future of your country. My former professor doesn't think I'm insane, which is *wonderful* news to me...but everyone else I know might.  

I so desperately want something positive or at least influential to come out of all this. I *really*, fucking, do, mostly for my sake and personal peace but also for the rest of the human race.","2018-03-21 04:48:13","0","40","0.48","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/85zj0a/im_so_fucking_stuck_on_where_to_go_or_what_to_do/","True","ThisIsMyRental","1747937616.614996","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
