Yet still we cling to old outmoded ways of doing things in every aspect of our society, politics, medicine, education, healthcare, government, banking, energy production and transportation.

Could the massive sea change that new technology brings be not collapse as it feels but a transition from old to new?

 * Society is massively more interconnected and has access to a universe of information.

 * Politics is still based on a two party system, when we could have  a truly democratic system with modern technology allowing everyone to participate.

 * Medicine could become proactive rather than reactive, when your smartwatch is able to monitor your health.

 * Education imagine an online education system that lets students learn at their own pace in topics they love from the best academics courses in the world, coupled with local learning and athletic clubs.

 * Healthcare that could start with taxing unhealthy foods and drinks.

 * Automated government, how much of what our government does is just information processing allowing funds to be reallocated from bureaucracy to manual social services.

 * Banking is just information processing, as Bitcoin has shown a cryptocurrency could replace our current banking system.

 * Energy production, we are in a massive transition point when renewable energy is overtaking fossil fuels.

 * Transportation will undergo a massive change as electric vehicles take over from combustion engines and automated driving completely changes our usage and need patterns, think subscription based on demand cars.

So could collapse just be a close and personal perspective of what is in the longer view a cycle of out with the old and in with the new?

After all we are discussing collapse on the world wide web.

Note there is the wild card of climate change:  How bad will it get?  Will it force us to change faster?","2016-10-30 15:18:20","6","31","0.61","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5a6gr0/is_collapse_just_the_birthing_pains_of_a_new/","True","Arowx","1747919919.8136902","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
