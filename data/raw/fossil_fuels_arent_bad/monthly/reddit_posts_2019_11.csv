The mineral mix in your phones won't last forever, for example the screen you see now, will soon be zapped straight into your brain. But that future will be for fewer and fewer people going forward, because we are cresting the top of peak communications. We cresting the hi tech ridge of Seneca's Cliff, when minerals can't be sourced and supplied, and costs spiral out of control due to myriad realities.

Rare earths are by-products of mining and crushing tons of rock for very very little return. It's like gold panning on a world scale. It's non sustainable. But when? People know a new phone every year can't last. When I was young I was told cigarettes are bad, do you think I gave a fuck? The young don't care if 5G will kill you, just like cigarettes. The few who can hear me now know it doesn't matter. I would like to thank the guy who wrote about Seneca's Cliff and warned of mineral shortages back in 2012. I would like to thank today's Natural Gas Low Inventory poster for tying this together.

[We Are Running Out Of These Special Elements. Here's How, -  YT 9:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuLHfiyIS0Q)

Phones, TVs, solar panels, and electric car batteries are all made of rare earths and unusual elements. As our modern world creates more and more of these technologies, will things go from ""rare"" to ""nonexistent"" and what will we do then? This video does a pretty excellent run down on reality.

Ignore the rest below, just rants and raves of an ol' lunatic.

After the smart phones go, so will the Green Raw Deal.

**What Most Yuppies Do Not Know About Green Energy**

Green energy is not green at all. It takes one ton of coal to make 6 solar panels. Wind turbines are made of glue, fiberglass, cement and steel. They use 100X the resources for 1/10th the energy. They become toxic waste sooner than you think, and they cause energy poverty and hardship for the poor, especially those poor white buggers in northern Europe. Green energy cannot decouple economic growth from emissions, that notion is the elitist pap of ivy league schools.

Electricity is nearly 25% of the world's total energy use. Wind energy provides 3.5% of total energy. Wind power produces 90% of its maximum power 25% of the time. Offshore turbines can produce 90% of their maximum power 40% of the time, but they cost twice as much and last only half as long. Wind turbine can stop producing power within minutes, which stresses the power grid greatly. Over stressed power grids lead to black outs. While both wind and solar can produce nearly all of Nordic Europe's energy on some days, most days wind and solar produce little more than 10% of their max power. Ten percent of maximal power is not the stuff of industrial civilization. Industrial civilization is what you need for your precious phone to work.

**Poor People Can't Afford Green Energy**

The European Council hopes to make the entire continent carbon neutral by 2050, but green policies have created new economic problems for Europe's poorest, and for businesses. The consequences of green policies are already starting to be felt, and Europe is still a long way from its goals.

 To achieve them, governments may have to contain widening social discontent and political tensions and manage the harm that is being done to Europe's economy. Can Europe's green experiment make it a world leader in sustainability, or has a doomed policy agenda already given the world a lesson in unsustainable policy making?

Unrealistic ideas about renewable energy are at the heart of policymakers' green agenda. Despite their promises, wind and solar developers have been unable to compete with their fossil fuel counterparts. Public subsidies were needed to guarantee green investor profits. Domestic energy prices rose the most across the EU, leading to hardship and energy poverty, where a poor family or individuals cannot get their daily rations of energy that that are needed to sustain their lives.

What poor people really need is is thermal security in in wintertime and autumn.Energy poverty is already hurting poor elderly in Europe, especially during the intense cold spells we now see because of climate change. The situation has been very bad in in in Greece, where people have resorted to cutting trees for heating. This situation aggravates tree loss and air pollution.  

The target for the German government is reach zero emissions for every energy consumer by 2050.  This means that poor people have to pay a price premium for energy. Poor Europeans are nearing the energy poverty frontier. This frontier will end up in a social and economic disaster.   Bigger problems for Europe's leaders have been caused by the rising cost of electricity for industry.  Since the EU has the highest energy prices among all G20 countries, energy intensive industries were subsidized in order to allow them to compete. Despite these efforts, heavy industry has been increasingly shifting out of the EU, to countries where cheaper energy and labor is available, and where environmental standards are lower.

Up to now, their economy is still somewhat functional. But this is changing as banking and economic models fall apart in the face of higher electrical costs.  The EU is now proposing further cuts in emissions, that will hurt the poor even more. Yet, the Greens say that is not enough. The Greens want to forbid the use of diesel and gasoline vehicles 2030. They want to forbid oil and gas for home heating by 2025, and they say we want not to build any roads beyond 2025.

The vehicle industry in Germany is one of the most powerful in the world. It is the heart beat of their economy. Millions of people are dependent on German car manufacturing. All this is happening while car sales drop worldwide. Germany now seems to be on the brink of recession, with its industrial sector leading other sectors of the economy into decline. It is insane for Germany to use solar panels to build diesel cars. By 2040, there will be 2 billion cars on earth, and only 200 million will be electric, at the very best.

Greenhouse gas emissions in 14 of the 19 largest countries, have risen since 2014. Consequently, all EU countries are missing their Paris agreement targets. The generous subsidies that European governments have given to green energy generators have become politically and economically unsustainable. Rising energy prices have become a political liability.

When governments in Europe cut back on profit guarantees for wind turbine farms, private investment plummeted.

[Wind and solar are thriving in Europe — without any ... - Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/30/17408602/solar-wind-energy-renewable-subsidy-europe)

This has been embarrassment to the country which hosted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 23rd meeting in 2017. Shortly after the conference, it emerged that Germany would fail to meet its 2020 targets for emissions reduction, energy consumption and renewable energy production. These failures have signaled to the world that not even advanced and wealthy countries can meet the targets they set without causing great hardship.

Europe's ambitious green policies face many technical and political challenges. Targets have been set without any idea about how to achieve them. Despite European statements of unity and commitment, green values are not shared across Europe. In the recent EU parliamentary elections, European Green Party successes were confined to the north and the west of Europe. There is growing skepticism of green policies where incomes are generally significantly lower in the south and east. 

The hardships felt by Europe citizens as a result of rising prices and loss of competitiveness have caused a polarization of European politics with the center losing to ascendant populist right wing parties.  Meanwhile, even within the greenest of EU Member States, these green policies have triggered political crises. France has seen a year of protests, sparked by green taxes that added to the rising costs of living. People have been killed and hundreds of people have been seriously injured. Farmers angry about the increasing burden of environmental regulations, organized protests that brought the country to a standstill.

These protests are reactions to policies that have been set without any idea of how they will be achieved and take no account of the opinions of people for whom they will cause hardship. Europe's green policy experiments are far from saving the planet, and seems instead to push Europe closer towards economic and political chaos. Europeans are muddling though right now, but in the next few years, black outs will become more common, as the brittle fragility of renewable energy becomes obvious.

Meanwhile back at the ranch, China is sucking up all our jobs, and laughing at our policy foolishness. The US mass media is the laughing stock of the world, and the average Yuppie Yank doesn't have an actual clue to what's really going on. China pours more cement in 3 years than the US ever did in 300 years. Their newest airport is so fucking huge, it's unbelievable - while American airports are again the laughing stock of the world.

I don't know this stuff because I'm a fucking genius, I know it because I'm willing to read both Zero Hedge and Ecowatch. Both sides are bullshitters, each worse in their own way. Ignore either side at your peril. Sitting around thinking you're more enlightened than most people doesn't help anyone.

I spent years as a homeless person, and I spent years helping homeless people. While I was doing that, you likely spent years in school learning a bunch of bullshit that has almost no relevance to your life. Decoupling is for dogs, not world economies.
