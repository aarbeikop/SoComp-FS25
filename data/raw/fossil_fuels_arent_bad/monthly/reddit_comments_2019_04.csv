And yeah I know that technically it is finite and that means we’ll have to run out sometime. But the fact is that by the time we really start the downward spiral, it won’t matter. Either we won’t need fossil fuels anymore due to catastrophic climate change, or we’ll be forced to switch to renewables anyway. There’s no using the last drop of oil.  As for when the decline will start affecting consumers, it’s already happening and will continue. ","2019-04-01 14:17:22","18","noddly","1747943141.6921349","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

Every petrochemical company is working on finding a way to use CH4 Clathrates as a source of for our needs.  If it fucks Mama Nature the oil dudes and dudettes will find a way to profit from it, regardless of environmental calamity.","2019-04-01 14:42:49","9","Nilbogtraf","1747943141.696007","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

The era of cool gasoline like from beverly hill billies and the middle east where it squirts out of the ground is of course over but coal will stick around for much longer than you or my lives and could keep us going to some degree. Probably to realize an even shittier version of what we've got now, with more holes and insane weather and degradation of natural systems. 

No telling how the crunches from crude and fracking draw downs will be. I think water, food and weather are issues before running out of gas.  ","2019-04-01 19:46:50","2","digdog303","1747943141.701782","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

"ejwbewt","t3_b82kzg","b82kzg","collapse","skeptical","The general consensus on this sub is that we have more than enough to last until the planet is fucked up beyond repair. But as you said, nothing renewable currently comes close to replacing fossil fuels. For that reason, collapse is going to involve a massive human die off this century, one way or another. Simple fact is fossil fueled agriculture is necessary to keep our 7+ billion humans alive. We either go renewable and billions will starve (enough crops can't be planted and harvested by solar powered tractors), or we keep burning oil, and billions will starve (from climate change related drought and floods causing crop loss).","2019-04-01 19:56:58","0","Elchup15","1747943141.709603","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
