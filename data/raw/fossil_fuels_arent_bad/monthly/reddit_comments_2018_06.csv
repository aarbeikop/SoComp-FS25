increased instances of ""sunny day"" flooding (which is exactly what it sounds like)

severe storms of increasing power and frequency

greater temperatures swings (record lows and highs, sometimes days apart) 

The practical of effect of this will be severe. Food prices will rise as crops fail. Billions of dollars of infrastructure will be permanently damaged and eventually abandoned. Hordes of climate refugees (both emigrants and immigrants) will overwhelm those of us lucky enough to be in semi-habitable areas (semi habitable because the summers here are already becoming too hot).  

There's a very good chance the next recession will be caused by the insurmountable debts of oil companies that invested too heavily in unconventional oil. If this happens I expect it to be the death knell of industrial civilization. The so called ""seneca effect"" comes into play and within 20 years (if we're insanely lucky) the industrial age will be completely over. 

Because cheap conventional oil makes everything else cheap the lack of cheap conventional oil will make everything way too expensive for the average idiot to afford. Things like cellphones, personal automobiles, air conditioning will strictly be the realm of the wealthy. Billions will die of starvation or war. The deaths will begin in developing nations.

""riots in China over food shortages. . .""

""Yesterday the Indian Government appealed to the UN for more food aid . . .""

It is notable that the world government is already Authoritarian and Totalitarian. We are already living in a total surveillance state, everything I type right now goes through GCHQ in the UK is run through a bank of analytical algorithms to determine if I am a threat to the Government. Some tech companies notably Samsung have been found to have surveillance systems built into their consumer electronics. You TV is watching you with a hidden cam and listening with a hidden mic Via your WiFi connection. You are not safe to have privacy even within your own living room. I can see this abuse of technology and power giving rise to people being rounded up and arrested in the middle of the night and taken away to ""re-education"" facilities in due time. 
I know this sounds conspiracy but I would not at all be shocked to see this come to pass.

Why would they do this? to prevent an uprising. To remove leaders and organisers and dissenters who would work to overthrow the regime before the seeds can grow into an organised movement. 

>The climate thing has a cliffhanger vibe in my outlook. I see a lot of technological potential for humanity to move toward a more sustainable model. I think advances with batteries, desalination, synthetic meat and dairy. CCS, etc. will give us at least the theoretical capability to avoid an apocalypse.

I disagree. Yes you are correct about human potential. We can if we wanted to, engineer our way out of this, or at least ensure our survival either in space or in bunkers etc...  But the problem is everything comes down to MONEY. Always with the money. And to really TRY to fix this and save ourselves as I have been told time and time again, would bankrupt the planet and cause total economic collapse. And social collapse.  So no, it will not happen. 

>Given the delay between forcing from greenhouse levels and climate equilibrium and the fact that transition away from fossil fuels will take time, I think we're committed to increasing gg levels until at least mid-century and will approach CO2 ppm of 500 minimum.

I strongly believe we are heading towards 500 ppm within 5 years time. I know I will be criticized for saying this, (state your source! state your source!)

But the answer I've given a lot of people is that I simply believe life will look a lot different when I'm old than it does now. That is, if I don't kill myself in the next 10 years or so....

There's just so much shit going on, it's impossible to know how it will all interplay. Overpopulation, climate change, social and economic changes, the race to ""fix"" all of it with technology and policy changes....

Climate change just isn't going to be fought in any meaningful way. Or, rather, once the beginnings of the ""worst case scenarios"" start to show, it will probably cause panicked reactions from governments from all over the world -- well after it's been deemed ""too late."" It's already too late. Maybe not to avoid worst-case-scenarios, but at least to stop or reverse it. A new article surfaces on a major media outlet every few days about how we're already past one tipping point or another, or crossed a point of no return.

The global population will continue growing for at least a few more decades, at which time it will ""stabilize."" Resource scarcity, food crises, relocation emergencies will surely follow. Migration and refugee crises will surely become worse over time.

Peak oil will continue to be pushed back and back -- until it can't be anymore. I remember reading about it having peaked in 2005. It's just creeping along, looming in the background. It hasn't torn society apart yet, like I was led to believe when I was a teenager. But it might. Or it might be uneventful, in the landscape of other shit going bad.

The widening gap between the richest and the poorest is sure to get wider still, with most of us in the middle being pulled one way or another. It's already fairly normal for people to have 2 jobs or more just to support themselves. The poorer half will likely see their work hours climbing just to maintain the same level of living, while the richer half will continue to take vacations and live as if nothing has changed.

(Related: Looking for work in Northern Michigan.)

Online shopping is driving more and more businesses away. Automation is making more and more jobs unnecessary. A growing population creates the need for more work, and technological progress creates an undeniably better experience for many areas of business and life makes more of those jobs unnecessary. You have a tug-of-war happening. And the technology has always won. The jobs are going to continue to disappear. Sooner or later universal basic income will have to be addressed in a real way. But because in much of the world the political will -- or even willingness to talk or think about it -- isn't there, it won't happen. So those who depended on the jobs that disappear become poorer yet. But the war between haves and have-nots? It'll probably never come about. Instead, someone will profit off of the slums.

None of it is going to happen fast or dramatically, unless the unexpected happens. A large-scale single season/year food shortage would make things interesting -- but probably won't happen. We're taking one of the 99 bottles of beer off the wall, passing it around, and reaching for another. Hell, when you still have 98, 97, 90, 80 -- things are still looking pretty good. Even when you only have 20 left, it doesn't look so bad.

But late in the night when we're all fucked up, someone realizes we're almost out and they need to go on a beer run. Only the store went out of business, the brewery got bought out by BrewCorp, they've been using toxic water, the price of barley skyrocketed, the car is almost out of gas and no one has money to pitch in for the $8/gallon gas prices, let alone the beer. Most of us are still making just barely above minimum wage and we have work in the morning. This was our one day off.

A lot has been happening out there while we were partying -- and we probably couldn't have changed a single thing even if we were paying attention.

---

I don't know, it's going to be a strange and uncomfortable ride. I figure by 2050 things will look pretty unrecognizable, but even that's just random guessing. Our children will have completely different lives.

The internet and technology are sticking around, as far as I can see. So we'll have this strange mix of screens and distractions, even as most of us have to work harder to get less.

I probably chose wrong 10 years ago, when I decided not to pursue a lucrative career where I could put away a lot of money. But even then I didn't see the point in getting invested into a way of life I wasn't sure would be around much longer. Even for those who chose a different path, I don't know how much real wealth they'll have to show in 30 or 40 years. I see friends who are buying property and building homes, and I envy them -- but also shudder when I think about owing to a bank for 30+ years. 30 years is a long damn time to trust that all of this is going to hold together.

One of the only things I have going for me is that I'm smart and adaptable. But I'm not sure how much that is worth. ","2018-06-18 18:53:04","3","naked_feet","1747938834.187186","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

There's a problem in fantasy literature ( I know it has a name but I can't think of it at the moment) and this problem is that the definitive work of the genre, Lord of The Rings, was derived from interpretations of European myths but that as time moved on works in the genre began to look to myths and naturally generated human experiences less and less and began to reexamine and reinterpret previous works more and more. As this process happened the genre became more detached from human experience and the real world and more grounded in tropes which limited the genre's capacity to tell meaningful stories.

Now obviously this isn't universally true for fantasy literature, and more importantly you might be asking what any of that has to do with your post or the collapse generally. It has to do with the fact that post apocalyptic films and American ideological views about individualism have created a similar non-reality based self reinforcing loop on what the collapse will be like, what one should do, and whether individualism is even relevant to the topic at all.

A podcast I like recently interviewed a Syrian writer about the civil war and one thing he said stuck out to me "" what I learned from Syria is that any group can defeat any individual"". Communities hang up blankets to guard against snipers, people pool money to escape together, they look out for each other and that's what allows them to survive, not the hoarding culture of fantasizing preppers

The reality of collapse is not a story of individuals going it alone and protecting their kin. Those people die. Into the wild does not end with the guy happily making it all alone in Alaska. Theres a reason most survival shows are faked or are developed by cranks. Even the people who do live up there in the Alaskan wilds survive on airdrops and all the infrastructure and mass communication that makes those airdrops possible. 

Only the strongest individual guy survives is a bullshit lie sold to you by a culture that really likes the idea of individual strength and much like how the legions of bad fantasy books aren't much more than pale imitations of Lord of the rings the idea that you'll survive the collapse by being a rugged self sufficient individualist is just a pale imitation of the first episode of The Walking Dead.","2018-06-02 01:18:51","22","[deleted]","1747938897.097229","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

 I’ve always disliked the humans are cancer argument because it lacks the critical distinction of recognizing that not all humans that have existed behaved like cancer. To try and hold onto the cancer analogy while acknowledging it doesn’t fit all humans you must search for a different culprit, the true culprit, humans cultural configuration. 

The more appropriate analogy is that a particular cultural configuration is like an oncovirus, the humans are like cells, and the cells turn into cancer when infected with the oncovirus of civilizations culture.

Even the humans that maintain relative homeostasis, like some hunter and gatherer tribes, mostly still have effects like invasive species outside of their environment of evolutionary adaptation in Africa and in modern times. 

Most species are caught in an evolutionary race at a genetic evolutionary pace, fox catches slow rabbit, fast rabbits pass on genes some slower foxes can’t catch enough rabbits, faster foxes pass genes, new foxes catch slow rabbits and so on… This is called the red queen effect there is a balance where they are both evolving to stay in the same place in homeostasis. 

The fundamental difference that makes humans like invasive alien species is that they have broken out of this genetic arms race, instead of co-evolving in lockstep through incremental **genetic adaptation**, we evolved to the point where our cognition allowed us strong **conscious adaptation**. 

This was a Phase change, fundamentally different, conscious adaptation can function on incredible short timescales that are as good as instantaneous in relation to genetic evolution. To illustrate this, think about one day you are this fragile creature, slow, no big teeth, no thick skin, no claws, then making a spear&atlatl is like having a giant claw that can reach out 20 meters faster than most creatures can run, you can wear the thick warm skins of other animals and make fire, now ranges outside your tropical temperature zones can be colonized, full of creatures that didn’t co-evolve with your presence, your weapons, your nets, your culture. This conscious adaptation is like the singularity to creatures dependent on genetic adaptation. Even the things that would keep us in check like disease have been overcome by conscious adaptation, we once had to evolve on the genetic level to win the race against infectious bacteria but we used conscious adaptation to create antibiotics that kill bacteria, borrowing practically instant resistance from the complex biochemical armory of the fungal kingdom (penicillin) what it evolved over millennia. Luckily for bacteria, their generation rate along with their horizontal gene transfer ability is sufficiently fast to evolve resistance to our shenanigans.","2018-06-02 02:45:22","17","[deleted]","1747938897.103999","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

If you take the view that the atom bomb is an extension of the policeman is an extension of sticks and stones, and our desire to do more with less (which we believe leads to the Garden of Eden, i.e. having it all for nothing), then it is our desire for immortality that is a leading cause of our issues.

But how can be a common good if it results in so much suffering? ","2018-06-01 22:32:04","1","[deleted]","1747938897.1178062","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"dzz700k","t3_8nuouq","8nuouq","collapse","skeptical","Honestly, I've given this a bit of thought and it's really a question of holding up the things that make the thing work in the first place.

And it's really three basic things.

First, culture.  Not race, culture.  HBD is bullshit.  That means shared language, religion (or at least a dominant religion among minor religions), culture, values, norms, and experiences.  So in China it would be Confucianist, you'd watch Chinese TV, listen to Chinese pop, watch soccer, etc.  in America, it's Christianity, American tv, Rap or Pop, and NFL or baseball.  You can go to any part of the country and most people will be familiar with all of those things.  

Second is economics.  Trade.  This works so long as both parties think they can get a better deal by participating than by not.  If the benefits of the trade aren't there, or if everyone assumes that the other guy is cheating, the economy stops.

Third is institutions.  These need to be honest, strong enough to enforce the rules, and impartial.  Honest, because once you figure out that a well placed bribe can get you favors, that's what you do.  And so does everyone.  If the institution is too weak nobody trusts it to fix the problems.  If the Fcc is too weak to enforce communication rules, nobody cares about them.  And if they're not impartial, than nobody trusts them .  Any such breakdown essentially means that you come up with informal systems to go around the government, or you simply don't listen to them.","2018-06-02 03:17:50","1","Palentir","1747938897.120296","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

* How do I view what happens?

* What am I to do now?

As I see it, that goes deep. So I had to express my gratitude!","2018-06-02 03:41:43","1","Hubertus_Hauger","1747938897.121611","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"dzzl6d5","t3_8nuouq","8nuouq","collapse","skeptical","Let me too address your initial questions of **how do I view what happens** and **what am I to do now**? 

* First: Simple: “The logic of evolution/life/nature itself”

* Second: We are all together in this. So we practically get trough that mess collectively, staying afloat, do survive and rebuild with others after equilibrium has been reached.

Truly we must or most probably do already partake in the blame-game. Whoever we prefer to give the dirt to. All this in order to feel righteous or at least to appear so in the peer-groups we belong.","2018-06-02 10:56:19","1","Hubertus_Hauger","1747938897.123297","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"dzztjh2","t3_8nuouq","8nuouq","collapse","skeptical","For 1) I'd say that all of the things you listed played a role. Some more minor, others more major.

As for 2) I'd say the way we set up society got us into this mess. And the fact we didn't change things didn't help either (some tried, but were and are suppressed). In a way, it's all our fault. But in another way, it is the elites and those with power, the corporations, fault, using the state to suppress movements trying to change things using the state","2018-06-02 14:42:14","1","mozzypaws","1747938897.1244721","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
