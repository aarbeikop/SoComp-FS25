"5oyk9k","environment","emotional","Just an optimistic shower thought","I've been seeing quite a few headlines of foreign countries, such as China and India, pledging to push renewable energy and combat climate change despite Trump's efforts to push for fossil fuels. It got me thinking that, what if Trump's denial of climate change has inadvertently inspired countries to combat his regressive views by decreasing their own emissions? After all, it is in China's best interests to get ahead of the U.S. economically, and utilizing renewables is a good way to do that, especially when the president wants to bring back outdated technologies (coal). It seems that this is their opportunity to prove themselves a progressive nation, the task made much easier by having such a headstrong idiot in charge of their largest competitor for most powerful nation. So hey, maybe it's not all bad? Just a thought.","2017-01-19 19:12:47","6","0","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5oyk9k/just_an_optimistic_shower_thought/","True","ltyboy","1747921649.968192","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
