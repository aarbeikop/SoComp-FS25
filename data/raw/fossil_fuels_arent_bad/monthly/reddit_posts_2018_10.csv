"9mv7j9","collapse","skeptical","The Electric Vehicle Fantasy","Let's ignore, for the moment, the myriad difficulties involved in replacing all personal transportation vehicles with Electric Vehicles (EVs). Let's ignore the fact that at current and projected future production rates, we simply won't have enough available minerals to make electric vehicles for a significant percentage of the world's population. Let's ignore that the mining, refining, fabrication, and shipping of the materials needed to produce EVs would still necessarily be powered by fossil fuels. Let's ignore that the high cost of batteries means that EVs are prohibitively expensive for most even in the Western world. Let's ignore the fact that trucks, ships, and airplanes cannot be effectively electrified, limiting EVs to solving only personal and family transport problems. Let's ignore the fact that the supply lines necessary to economically produce these vehicles depend on slave labor. Let's ignore the massive road infrastructure, which can only be maintained with fossil fuels, which EVs depend on. And let's go ahead and ignore the many problems I forgot to mention.

So, after having ignored all these major issues, I pose this question to you: Assuming every light duty vehicle in the world is electrified, what have we gained?

We've certainly achieved a modest decrease in GHG emissions. According to the EPA, transportation in the U.S. accounts for 28% of GHG emissions, and light duty transport accounts for 60% of that. By electrifying the whole light duty sector, we've reduced GHG emissions by 16.8% - not too shabby. As the rest of the world's light duty transport sectors use a lot less gasoline, the reduction is less for the rest of the world, but still surely significant. This is of course not nearly the reduction needed (since we need 100%), but if you assume that none of the problems with renewable electricity generation exist, then combining EVs with renewable generation would represent a significant GHG reduction. Electricity generation in the US is 28% of GHG emissions as well, so making ALL electricity with renewables and electrifying ALL light duty transport adds up to a 44.8% reduction in GHG emissions. Not bad. Not nearly enough, but not bad.

But what else have we gained? Well, we've gained the ability to continue the almost unfathomably inefficient ""happy motoring and suburbia"" system that we built over the last 100 years. We can continue hauling 2 tons of metal and plastic with us every time we need to get groceries. We can continue commuting 2 hours (or more!) a day to and from work. We can continue driving around in circles for entertainment (let's go to Stacy's place and then hit the bar afterward!). We can continue all the incredibly wasteful and unequal ways in which we use our cars. Shopping for all manner of disposable items, long distance road trips for the hell of it, etc. We can continue choosing not to change. We can continue, for a time, believing that our way of life is sustainable. 

But of course, it is not. Electric cars themselves will become trash, plastic, filling landfills alongside all the trash we purchase and consume and throw away while using those electric cars. Trash which will fill the oceans, oceans which will continue to be fished until there is nothing left (global catch is already declining!). Deforestation will continue accelerating. Our political systems will still be owned by megacorporations. Our systems of wealth distribution will continue to be horribly unequal, spelling slavery and destitution for billions. Debt will still compel the people of the world to work toward their own destruction. Our water will continue to be stolen and bottled for profit. Our aquifers will keep on depleting. Our soil will be eroded into the sea as we desperately consume it trying to feed the world's appetite. The agricultural inputs, on which modern agriculture is 100% dependent, will continue being consumed at an ever faster rate until there are not enough of them left. Climate change will still happen regardless (we only got a 44.8% reduction, remember?), spelling mass migrations and wars and superstorms. 

In short, EVs will let us believe that we can continue, for just a little longer. They are already helping us believe that since, though they haven't yet made any impact on market share, people hear about the ""coming"" (heavy emphasis on the quotation marks) EV revolution and rejoice. 

So Rejoice! Go buy a Tesla from Elon Musk. Do your part to support the Green Capitalists! The Electric Vehicles are coming to save us! 

It's a comforting thought. I hope it helps you ignore reality just a little while longer.
