Not for shipping. So your bitcoin revolution is only gonna work if we make local solar powered 3D printers that can make everything with ambient carbon and/or thermodynamics-breaking e-waste reclaimers. (Because otherwise you're going to need those giant machines to get the raw materials needed for all the computers and shit for bitcoin and ai cars). 

The next paradigm is not gonna be ""tech 2.0"". It is going to be something few of us are trying to grasp at the moment, because it's going to involve a serious reduction in material expectations.","2016-10-30 16:23:52","7","digdog303","1747919922.261996","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

That's why 'Too Big to Fail' is a stupid policy. We can't advance if we're held back by what went before.","2016-10-30 20:38:46","2","shortbaldman","1747919922.267715","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"d9er32t","t3_5a6gr0","5a6gr0","collapse","skeptical","21st century technology is a product of industrialised civilisation. We can't have computers/solar panels/tech without fossil fuels at this stage due to mining, transportation and manufacturing which are all reliant on fossil fuels. There are no renewable energy technologies currently in the pipeline to change this. 

The world needs to have zero net carbon emissions by 2050 if we're going to avoid the death of hundreds of millions and the collapse of industrial civilisation. We're not going to get to this technology based utopia.","2016-10-31 01:29:55","2","jdp200","1747919922.270605","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"d9e13g2","t3_5a6gr0","5a6gr0","collapse","skeptical","Interesting question in a spengler-esque context. I believe that this was the goal of the beatniks (kerouac) as they were trying to introduce a new religion. In spengler's models, all civilizations are based on a core set of principles and exist until people stop believing in them, about a 1,000 year process.

It would be interesting to note how long an internet/tech society would last in this case since internet time is ~10x faster tghan real time.

And i think your list is too US-centric","2016-10-30 15:52:33","1","knuteknuteson","1747919922.27315","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

"d9f1u9q","t3_5a6gr0","5a6gr0","collapse","skeptical","Here is how I think this will all playout:

Stage 1 Now -> 10 years

* Stagflation - Slow GDP growth coupled with inflation
* Conversion to renewable economy
* Resource Depletion
* Basic Income Introduction

Stage 2 5 -> 15 years

* Negative growth
* Currency devaluations
* Stock Market collapse
* Food shortages
* Drought, heatwaves, and severe weather
* Climate refugees

Stage 3 10->20 years

* Banking Collapse
* Military Rule
* Martial Law
* Severe Climate Chaos

Stage 4 20+ years from now

* Rationing
* Communism
* Coastal Flooding

Edit: Added Basic Income in stage 1.
