"ezwbyil","t3_d2njzz","d2njzz","climate","scientific","It's not just fossil fuels, as a civilization could arise on a planet without similar tectonic shifting. Either utilizing an energy source where you choke on the byproduct, or using up your entire primary energy source, or both, would be likely I'd think. Burning biomass or using deposits of chemical energy to develop an industrial civilisation both fit this criteria. Even primitive nuclear fission, like we have. What sort of race would decide to take a long, slow approach to hi-tech *before* running headlong into the limits of their biosphere's ability to support them? I think the first great filter is achieving a stable, multi-generational world order that can continue to function indefinitely on a planet. Once you have that, the scientific method, and at least some resources needed for tech it's just a matter of time to get out of the gravity well.

Stumbling blocks could include:

* Living above the biosphere's refresh rate of natural resources (food, water, air)
* Destroying too much biodiversity and wrecking ecologies (extinct species will not be replaced by new species for millions of years)
* Deploying weapons capable of annihilating self species as well as others
* Squandering non-renewable resources like metals
* Predictable planetary disasters that have not been planned for, eg no long-term food storage","2019-09-11 14:44:52","6","[deleted]","1747944952.456049","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

"ezxhwsd","t3_d2njzz","d2njzz","climate","scientific","My thoughts on this hypothesis are the following.  Advanced life can only come from evolution after many hundreds of millions of years of refinement.  That process only works because the primary driver for evolution is the goal of replication.  Without replication and successive generations of a given species, there is no evolution.  So replication was the very first thing that evolved.  From the very start, this goal of replication as the primary driver has caused species to maximize their utilization of the natural resources in a given environment, and has favored those that are able to adapt quickly to changes in their environment.  This means that, by and large, species will eventually have to compete for resources, and evolution will favor those that act selfishly.  After all, a species that masters control of its natural resources has no barrier to growth.  Humans are such a species on this planet.  Nothing can possibly stop our growth if we choose to wipe out every other living creature and dominate the land.

In order to prevent an advanced species that masters its natural resources from turning into a cancer that eventually destroys itself, there must be a counter to the innate biological desire to procreate as much as possible.  Humans have only partially understood this.  There are plenty of examples of humans choosing not to procreate despite being in an ideal situation to do so (plenty of resources and no physical barrier).  Yet there are just as many examples of humans choosing to procreate even if their circumstances are less than ideal.  The desire to acquire more and more resources to ensure greater success in procreation is so ingrained in our DNA that we have modeled our economic systems after our biological ones.  Every capitalistic society favors growth over sustainability, despite the fact that there are finite resources on this planet.  We encourage competition over collaboration to win out over our rivals for those resources.  It's a zero-sum game.  I believe this type of evolution is universal, and would apply to any advanced lifeform on other planets.","2019-09-11 22:28:27","1","[deleted]","1747944952.4678888","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

""We are evolutionary not  very good at making the connection between  things that we do today and  the consequences it will have down the road""

Some scientists have concluded that because humans were just simple hunter-gathers for so long that we have been unable to develop cognitively and emotionally fast enough to be able to process complex modern science.

Also our evolution has allowed us to develop cognitive biases that cause motivated reasoning. People that work in the fossil fuel industries don't want to lose their work and profits so they reject climate change. The more libertarians learn about climate science the more they reject it because it means that government has to get involved in people's lives. Other people don't want to argue with their friends and tribes so they keep quite. The misleading information put out by the fossil fuel companies had very successfully fooled a lot of people. A lot of people just don't care, or don't want to hear about it. A lot of these decisions happen subconsciously and close the person off to further conversations.

Facts and evidence do not change deniers minds.

It has a quarter the energy density per volume that diesel does, but fuel cells are already twice as thermodynamically efficient as diesel combustion engines. 

With current technology, you can make a hydrogen fuel cell plane produced from that has half the range of a gas-powered plane at a marginally higher fuel cost.
