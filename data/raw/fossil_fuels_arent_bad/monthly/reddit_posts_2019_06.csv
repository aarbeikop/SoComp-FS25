&#x200B;

How many times do you need to bang your head against the wall to cause serious damage?. This is what its like dealing with people who quote ""climate change is a myth"". I am so frustrated & angry at the fact that most people eaither are blind to the damage we are causing or simply ignore it. At what point will people wake up to the fact that if we contiune down this path there is a good  chance we may be lost forever!. Individually we wont change the outcome no matter how hard we try but collectively we stand a chance. I would love to hear your thoughts about this.

>First, we’re still moving in the wrong direction. Global carbon emissions aren’t falling fast enough. In fact, they aren’t falling at all; they were up [**1.7 percent in 2018**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iea-emissions/global-carbon-emissions-hit-record-high-in-2018-iea-idUSKCN1R7005).  
>  
>Second, we’re still *pushing* in the wrong direction. Globally, subsidies to fossil fuels were up 11 percent between 2016 and 2017, reaching $300 billion a year.  
>  
>And third, the effort to clean up is flagging. Total investment in renewable energy (not including hydropower) was $288.9 billion in 2018 — less than fossil fuel subsidies and an 11 percent decrease from 2017.  
>  
>This is all bad news. The public seems to have the impression that while things are bad, they are finally accelerating toward something better. It’s not true. Collectively, we haven’t even succeeded in reversing direction yet. Despite all the progress described below, we’re still struggling to get ahold of the emergency brake.

**Emissions are rising. Fossil fuel subsidies are increasing. Investment in renewables is decreasing.**

&#x200B;

[**CO2 levels are accelerating**](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190604140109.htm)**:**

>The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increases every year, and the rate of increase is accelerating. The early years at Mauna Loa saw annual increases averaging about 0.7 ppm per year, increasing to about 1.6 ppm per year in the 1980s and 1.5 ppm per year in the 1990s. The growth rate rose to 2.2 ppm per year during the last decade. 

&#x200B;

[National Climate Assessment 2017 Executive Summary](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/executive-summary/) (emphasis mine):

>The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) emitted globally. **Without major reductions in emissions, the increase in annual average global temperature relative to preindustrial times could reach 9°F (5°C) or more by the end of this century.** With significant reductions in emissions, the increase in annual average global temperature could be limited to 3.6°F (2°C) or less.  
>  
>The global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has now passed 400 parts per million (ppm), a level that last occurred about 3 million years ago, when both global average temperature and sea level were significantly higher than today. Continued growth in CO2 emissions over this century and beyond would lead to an atmospheric concentration not experienced in tens to hundreds of millions of years. **There is broad consensus that the further and the faster the Earth system is pushed towards warming, the greater the risk of unanticipated changes and impacts, some of which are potentially large and irreversible.**  
>  
>**The observed increase in carbon emissions over the past 15–20 years has been consistent with higher emissions pathways.** In 2014 and 2015, emission growth rates slowed as economic growth became less carbon-intensive. Even if this slowing trend continues, however, it is not yet at a rate that would limit global average temperature change to well below 3.6°F (2°C) above preindustrial levels.","2019-06-18 17:33:59","117","67","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c256v4/ive_read_it_all_a_hundred_times_before_and_it/","True","climate_throwaway234","1747943891.982643","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"c2lf8p","collapse","skeptical","The ""Hard Stop"" Collapse Scenario","I think it is most likely that the behemoth that is the global economy will plow head-on into ecological meltdown.

That is to say, when agriculture, trade, industry take a hit, the people (and governments) with a vested interested will attempt to reassert themselves and get back on top.

If the economy contracts, politicians will do whatever it takes to reverse that trend and increase growth.

If agriculture yields drop, there will be a massive mobilization to innovate a way out of the problem.

If global pandemics erupt, heroic efforts will be made to resist and contain future outbreaks.

Even if the solutions dig us deeper in the hole, we will choose them when desperate enough.

We will continue to emit carbon until it is impossible to do so.

To use a boxing metaphor, civilization will be taking the blows and hitting back less often, but they will keep standing up as long as they are able.

It will be a war of attrition, where civilization and humanity will inevitably surrender. The game may be effectively over, but it could take many years for the final thud.

This is why you shouldn’t expect a particular day, or even a year, to be THE ONE. 

Then again, there is another scenario to consider: *The Hard Stop.*

Guy McPherson’s theory is an example of the Hard Stop scenario. 

The Blue Ocean event triggers the Clathrate Gun, which collapses civilization within months, ending global dimming and unleashing global nuclear plant meltdowns and other feedback loops, leading to unfathomable warming and a Venus-like hellscape. 

The whole process (as I recall) takes place in a matter of months.

To me, that’s a lot of hypothetical dominoes lined up in a very specific sequence. 

But I don’t think a Hard Stop scenario would need to be as bad as all that.

So what would it require and what would it include?

To me, a Hard Stop Collapse Scenario is *an event or series of events, within a 5 year duration, in which global economic GDP, emissions, and (likely) population plummet to pre-industrial levels—and do not bounce back.*

**Why 5 years?** 

I think that you must have a timeframe in which political actors simply couldn’t respond. No time for protests in the streets, no time for a revolution. No time to install “pro-growth” policies.

**What could cause such an event?**

A global nuclear war, in which all parties lost. A Black Death-like pandemic. Perhaps a “methane bomb” release in the arctic, as Guy imagines.

Perhaps there could be a Very Bad Year across Asia in which drought, heatwave, water shortage, food shortage, lead to a billion plus refugees attempting to migrate/escape to the rest of the world, leading a cascade of nation-state collapses. Like, there are so many victims that they overwhelm and destroy every safe haven they come to. Every economic and political system just disintegrates.

**Would a Hard Stop Collapse save us (or some of the planet at least)?**

The longer industrial civilization can plow on into the 21st Century, the worse the future will be. That much is obvious.

So would a Hard Collapse help?

Maybe some, but my guess is probably not. For five reasons:

First, in any scenario, not including nuclear war, warming would continue for a while due to the end of global dimming.

Second, if enough people survived, they may exist in a “de-regulated” anarchy, in which people would burn anything they want without penalty. Or may revert to more primitive forms of energy, like burning wood, which is not good.

Third, if GDP is gone, then geoengineering is probably off the table. This means that somehow locking carbon into the melting permafrost will not be imaginable, let alone feasible. Flying planes to seed the atmosphere at any scale may be impossible, too.

Fourth, we are a global community, connected by telecommunications and global summits. Climate change and other global problems require coordination or else you run into a Prisoner’s Dilemma (or a Tragedy of the Commons). We can’t even achieve this now. But a Hard Stop Collapse probably means any kind of global coordination would be exceedingly difficult.

Fifth, transitioning to a green/clean economy today requires using the wealth we have to invest, R&D, and lower costs through economies of scale (which require large populations necessarily). A Hard Stop scenario would mean we have a much smaller, much poorer population. The whole reason we got hooked on coal, oil, etc. is that it was so easy to get energy from. Ironically, a green/clean energy revolution may actually be harder without an incumbent fossil fuel industry than with it.

**Is it likely?**

Personally, I don’t think so. But Black Swan events never seem that way, until they happen. Then they are obvious. 

I DO think there could be a lot of collapse-bounce back a little-collapse again-bounce back-collapse, with some regions collapsing harder and faster than others, while others suffer less relatively speaking.

But it’s certainly possible.

"c01pgy","collapse","skeptical","Even the most informed climate scientists are blind to the systemic problems destroying the planet.","**Modern Homo sapiens civilization is irrevocably out-of-step with the natural world and is destroying its host ecosystem by  altering the geochemistry of the planet.** In other words, our fossil-fueled way of life has disrupted the conditions suitable for the long-term survival of mankind as well as most other living organisms. Each day of business-as-usual further degrades the habitability of the planet. Has any notable scientist admitted this publicly? No, instead they hang on to the hope that mankind can alter its self-destructive path. This [statement by a noted climate scientist](https://phys.org/news/2019-06-cryosphere.html) is exhibit A:

>**Is the disappearance of ice all bad?**  
>  
>The vanishing cryosphere has many negative consequences, but some positive ones as well. The disappearance of mountain glaciers in South America alone would imperil water, food and hydroelectric energy supplies for a region currently populated by 77 million people. Coastal populations worldwide will be threatened from rising sea levels. *On the other hand, the opening up of Arctic seaways in summer will sharply cut shipping distances for many oil tankers and container vessel It would also open the area to tourism. It would  also open greater access to mineral wealth. An estimated 30 percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13 percent of its undiscovered oil lie north of the Arctic Circle, largely offshore in relatively shallow water. The Arctic also holds potential motherlodes of metals. Mining of nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum and other metals is already underway in Russia, while zinc, lead, silver and gold are mined in Alaska. Greenland awaits development of its rich mineral potential. Yet, all these activities are fraught with many hazards, and their full benefits await the future.*

The meme of progress through industrial exploitation of resources is ingrained in mainstream thought. As President Bush Sr. proclaimed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, ""The American way of life is not negotiable."" And for those with the financial power to control public policy, dwindling resources will be kept first and foremost for those at the very top of our pyramid scheme economy.","2019-06-13 05:11:55","43","15","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c01pgy/even_the_most_informed_climate_scientists_are/","True","xrm67","1747943962.351594","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
