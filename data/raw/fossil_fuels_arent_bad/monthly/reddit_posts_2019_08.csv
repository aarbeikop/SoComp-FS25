Wether it be 2050 or even earlier thanks to feedbacks and inaction.

I'm honestly terrified by those, since it means that the warming will accelerate to points where any effort to lower or mitigate it will be impossible and that there is no hope anymore.


Even the cloud loss scares me, if it's as bad as people say it is.

and this: https://phys.org/news/2019-08-limits-rainforest-growth.amp

This has led by to give in and accept that all of us are going to look forward to a future similar to ""The Road"" in or lifetime and we will experience it. I mean many of us have a lifespan that goes as far as the 2080's.

Though then again someone here said that those lops were debunked and disproven. 


/u/ClimateNurse had this to say about them:


- Not exactly. Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.


For the methane hydrates/methane bomb shebang...In Svalbard, where there is a particularly notable clathrate eruption and bubbling, was discovered to be happening for at least 8000 years, and erupted likely due to water depth changes, as it is on a continental slope.


More than likely this is one of the few events where this can occur, as methane hydrates must be under high pressure at high depths, where warning from the sea floor, which is dramatically colder than the air, must reach it to destabilize it. On top of that, even in shallow areas, fluctuations in temperature have not destabilized them. Even should they be destabilized (which would take a long, long while), Shakova et al., the team where the methane bomb theory originated, found that much of it went directly into the water and dissolved. Given this, methane releases would be small, given it is [quite soluble already in water, and research by Shakova & more backs this up.] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017RvGeo..55..126R) The methane bomb theory was aided by the team extrapolating how much methane release was there due to it dissolving, therefore spawning an inaccurate number of how much methane is actually venting from there. (Plus, it's hard to concentrate and find out how much)


A 15 Gt burst (1% of permafrost in nothing but methane. This... Isn't plausible one bit) (the 50 Gt burst is described in Edit 2) would give us a heating of 1C for a short duration, 0.4C in long-term. Various scientists such as Gavin Schmidt, cast doubt on this quite frequently, saying it is incredibly unlikely. For actual permafrost, we can likely expect some variation. .5C under high emissions scenarios (closer to RCP 8.5), with some saying a bit lower, or around .3-.4C at the same time. The same study just linked also says under low emissions scenarios we'd expect .15C but due to various melt collapses (thermokarsts), this is up for debate. But thermokarst studies predicts less by 2100, under high emission scenarios, yet others predict (only for low emission scenarios) double the warming, making it closer to .3C.


Due to arctic sea ice loss already, we've been facing .11C extra of heating, or .2 W/m^-2.


If we lose summer arctic sea ice, we can face an estimated .16C, or .3 W/m^-2.


If it is furthered in extent (year round), we are expected to get .35C total (counting the .11C we are already facing). This is where things get...Tricky.


So, cloud albedo plays a role in negating warming- but how much, we don't know. Sea ice loss increases cloud cover by 81% over these areas consistently, potentially reducing the feedback (and being 2-3x better than sea ice).It may also provide negligible reduction, or be a positive feedback. There's a lot of variability here, but it isn't going to be a big mass heating in an instant. It'd be gradual as the ice goes away more and more, particularly as we get closer to an ice-free arctic.


For it to happen -this- year, well...We'd have to see a graph like this. Which is very, very, very unlikely. We'll probably track closer to 2012 this year, and for the next...Who knows? There is a -lot- of variabiliy with it.


- The aerosol masking effect is a big cluster of a...Mess, really.


Some predict .4C, but the most common one I see thrown around on Reddit is 1C, but people never seem to note that it is by 2100, and under a specific RCP scenario, rather than what is currently masked. A majority of models indicate lower levels, or around .5C. Various comments from climate scientists also say this.


However, aerosols aren't just black and white like most people say they are- and they're not all from fossil fuel emissions. Some are from agriculture, others from fires, others from fossil fuels (not counting the natural ones). Some also heat the world, rather than cool it, but the variety of places that they come from make it unlikely that we'll see them vanish rapidly.


- Not a good thing, for certain. But it wouldn't be an instant one either, as a reminder.


Dieback (which would happen at ~+3-5°C anyway), would happen over decades (if not longer), but this isn't accounting for deforestation in addition to this. It's important to realize it wouldn't just explode out a lot of carbon!


Forest dieback is defined as trees losing health, and is the decline of a forest after a point has been reached. A lot can go into it, such as pests, disease, etc., but it's nonetheless a progressive or premature loss of trees. They can be in specific areas, elevations, perimeters, etc.


Likely, it would eventually become a net source rather than sink over time, as weve seen with other dying forests, then start to fade away into a Savannah, as predicted. CO2 release due to this would be gradual, rather than instant.


...But the capacity of it isn't nice.


Edit: I'm going to do some more research as OPs links say that it could produce 140 years of human emissions (sounds off to me, even if is from the rainforest trust. But there's a lot of factors at play so im gonna check what others say! I could be wrong.) Also, edited my figures.


PREPARE FOR MATH.


It turns out the Hothouse Earth paper covered this a little, too! (from 2018) So, this paper estimates by 2100 that the Amazon rainforest dieback will add .05°C, under 2C of warming. It has a range of .03-.11°C, BUT is based on extrapolations of observed changes in diebacks and model projections. The total CO2 estimate released by 2100 is also around 15-55 GtC.


2014 articles from Journal of Ecology (posting on mobile, reading on desktop, will post articles here eventually) and the sources used for the Hothouse Earth paper line up with this. So, this seems to support the idea that it will be VERY drawn out. The worst case scenarios run with 24-40% biomass shrinkage by 2100. (15-25 GtC).


I ran some conversions on the claims by rainforest trust as well, w/ 140 billion tons being 127 Gt. I'm...Confused but also bad at math, so someone correct me if I'm wrong here. For reference, humanity releases ~42 GtC per year. Their math lines up with the Hothouse Earth paper w/ how much carbon is stored (they estimated 150-200 GtC).


A rough calculation of GtC to ppm is about (from the IPCC)


1ppm CO2 = 2.12 GtC = 7.76 GtCO2.
So: 1GtCO2 = .127ppm CO2
1GtC = .47 ppm CO2.
1ppm = 0.0046875C.


We see about a 3ppm rise per year, but this also is on a delay. So even the warming released from this would be delayed for a LONG while. It'd add in the end about ~90+-5 ppm, so it'd be in the current roughly 31 years of human emissions by ppm per year, but a bit over 3 by our total emissions per year. (a lot of our emissions are absorbed by the ocean primarily!) This warming would be delayed by a good bit and vary in the end, as we also have a delay in our emissions (.2°C/decade), so this is a lot of complexity, and this also presumes it'd be instant release -and- all released.


So, if the Amazon were to poof and release all of its CO2, it'd end up warming us by around .45C! (used 95 ppm as a reference).


However, this assumes all of it would be in the atmosphere and not in the oceans/vegetation/etc. Humans still will release far more, nonetheless!


Nonetheless, the dieback would likely be due to the fact that the rainforest is a self sustaining system, and after a certain point it would probably start to struggle. Combine that with a changing climate and you've got this. It'd be over a long period, but be irreversible.

Okay, having to rewrite this as I closed the page clicking to a paper to link. Whoops.

To quickly summarize (by 2100)
Permafrost + Methane = .15-.5C (.5C being RCP 8.5, methane hydrates ignored because they're not quite a threat)
Forest fires (boreal forest) = .02-.10C
Amazon dieback realistically = .03-.11C
Land sink change = .13-.27C

Carbon sinks also vary greatly depending on where they're at, what they are, how they'll be affected, what warming we'll hit, etc. So that is also too tricky to put into a singular post. The ocean is also one of our biggest carbon sinks, and absorbs a -lot-. Most of our emissions go into it, rather than vegetation.


I can't cover the carbon cycle much (if at all), as that's a bit out of my depth. I'll bug a climate scientist for sure, but I imagine it'd be similar to other feedbacks- over time, relatively small compared to human emissions.


- Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.

-  I've had the 1.6C claim thrown at me recently, so I was curious if it was from the same source. (It was from the temperature anomaly + estimated aerosol masking from the current date, though I've also had other baselines used, vs. what is commonly used- 1850-1900). The IPCC has gotten ice sheet melt wrong by a good measure, but observed warming has been incredibly accurate to date (with minor deviations above average). There's always going to be some deviation in predicted warming, which could also have added to this (they estimated .8C to 1.2C, with an average of 1C warming in the AR5 report.)


For temperatures to rise that high, we'd have to be far beyond...Well, any understandings of the climate, and forgo our observations to date (as our observations are very in-line with CMIP5 modeling), and presume that the climate ECS is far higher than what it is observed to be, or could be- even with the new model estimates.


For presuming averages, we have to take into account land & sea changes, and for the IPCC/Paris Agreement '1.5C', it must be an average of 1.5C over a certain period of time, rather than the average hitting this. (There's a lot of factors that go into consideration of the average, will dig it up when I can!) The average on some years -has- breached 1C repeatedly (the average from observations in 2017 was 1.2C!), but this was expected due to anomalies.



- A: GMOs can and will bridge the gap eventually.


B: Current biodiversity decline is largely due to horrible management of agriculture and pesticides. Those 2 stop we will see significant drops in species dying. Climate change is still an issue obviously but it's not the reasons species are rapidly dying. And just so you know *we are not in the 6th mass extinction*.



Not sure if i should feel better or event trust this at all. because me, like most people concerned about this believe we will see this on our lifetime, are depressed by it and feel hopeless about it. Thinking of the horrible deaths as well as the utter grief of seeing society collapse before our very eyes. Many of us are contemplating suicide even as they are unwilling to live long enough to see that happen.

Heck even much of us accepted and resigned that as the future as governments and corporations do nothing about it or oppose action against it in the face of activism and mounting public concern. Even the people guilty of inaction as they are unwilling to change their lifestyles or are unaware of the concern or even straight up deny  or dismiss it. either saying it wont affect them or having swallowed up the climate denial junk being generated by the right wing and the corporate propagandists. 

I dont know if if they are really as bad as what the articles, and people (including scientists) say but I feel that I will live to see the collapse of society and the extinction of Mankind within my lifetime or even earlier (either in the 2030s or even as early as the 2020s) thanks to the feedback loops. I'm even anticipating the Water Crisis (Nothing is being done to address the drying wells) as well as the collapse of the agricultural system and the famines it will produce thanks to bees going extinct and land becoming unusable as predicted in the IPCC report recently.


Given AR6 report is to be published this December 31st. I'm merely expecting more bad news or straight up ""The window has closed and any attempt now is impossible and the 2030 deadline has shortened"". Especially since this time around. Feedback loops will be taken into account. i can only imagine the disappointment these activists and all of us will have once its stated that it's either impossible at this point or it's too big to even handle anymore. The distraught and grief of them having to face a post apocalyptic world in their lifetime as there is nothing they can do anymore I hope we all accept what's coming and hope we at least die as swiftly, quietly, and as painlessly as possible. we al fear death dont we? And many of us fear a death from disease, starvation thirst and ehat stroke from this. or even getting killed by other survivors when society collapses. I'm even having nightmares of aimlessly wandering around a post apocalyptic world and then dying from hunger, thirst, and the intense heat from the  uncontrolled warming.

Those feedback loops don't make climate change like boiling a frog. It's more ike dying from a terminal sickness that rapidly gets faster.

It's hard if not impossible to have hope and make a difference when the thing you are fighting against increasingly accelerates faster than expected to the point where the deadline is going to hit you like a brick wall.","2019-08-13 22:57:53","41","81","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cq0xb7/are_the_feedback_loops_as_bad_as_people_say_they/","True","Newman1651","1747944625.783155","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
