Even if we powered our entire civilization with nuclear energy we would still bring the biosphere to its knees.

"dueshy6","t3_7y91ot","7y91ot","collapse","skeptical","Funnily enough the energy problem doesn't worry me the most. Yes renewable are flawed and we will need a base load system but I am still a little optimistic about them - all I'm saying is the game isn't up just yet but it is very late in the game. I hate to quote him but... Elon Musk said it best ""If we don't go renewable, we will collapse and slide into the dark ages"" - I just fear it will be a VERY bumpy ride to that end. The dark ages have not been ruled out by a long shot, we need 50 times the renewable power we have now to even contemplate moving over to a sustainable system.

That said, hypothetically lets just say we do solve the energy crisis. It doesn't matter if we don't have food and water and this is the real crux. Unpredictable weather means unpredictable water and food and this is going to be the killer move. On an individuals level there are things we can do to at least reduce the harm temporarily, but on a societal level I have no idea what will be done until people wake up to the problems.","2018-02-17 23:37:57","6","[deleted]","1747930332.22507","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

Meltdown proof but got shit canned because it can't make nukes and the power supply contracts to provide fuel for the light water reactors are insanely profitable.  They even had one working in the 60's.  Research it.  Basically unlimited power for 100+ years.  Make synthetic gasoline.  Pull the carbon out of the air.  Desalinate sea water.  Leave the lights on.  No worries.  Way easier than fusion.","2018-02-18 05:11:47","1","bkorsedal","1747930332.2318301","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

It doesn't naturally follow that profit is a bad thing, though.

>They preferred relatively unattractive pieces of green paper over concerns of their sustainability.

The green economy must be profitable, to be sustainable. If it's not good business, almost nobody will do it. 

We are going to have to rethink all of our systems, not just power generation and money. Agriculture needs an overhaul - switch from water and oil (fertilizer) Western style monoculture to water recycling and fertilizer producing polyculture Eastern aquaponics style. 

Bitcoin/blockchain(?) is decentralized which is good, but it's very very power hungry, which is bad and so in that way it seems like it has it's weaknesses as well, maybe we need to migrate to another iteration of currency. 

I think we can break down the problems that face us, and start to figure out timelines or predictions. I feel like we need a wiki and a project timeline, for all problems which present an existential threat to humanity. it does seem like climate change is very high on that list, yet our reaction as a race is not promising.","2018-02-20 06:21:41","1","IGnuGnat","1747930332.235248","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
