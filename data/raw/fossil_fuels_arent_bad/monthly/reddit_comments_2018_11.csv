It's bad, but it likely won't result in anything like end of the organized society, or really anything particularly close to it. Second, while 1.5C is bad, those bad things will not happen the exact moment we hit 1.5C, like we flipped some kind of switch. Numbers like 1.5, 2, 3 are arbitrary numbers. Instead of imagine shit hitting the fan the moment we reach those points, instead imagine it as things getting progressively worse with each degree we pass. So if things get, for example, say %5 worse in every degree between 1 and 1.5, that rate will go up to %8 between 1.5 and 2, and %12 between 2 and 3, and so on. Imagine the fight against global temperatures less as ""We stop ourselves before we hit the limit or we die instantly"" and much more as ""Every degree we limit ourselves from means things will be that much better in the future.""

Interesting thing to me is that from what I've been hearing from climate scientists and policymakers whose fields are associated with climate change, there aren't that much large criticism towards Paris Agreement. Most of them seem to be reasonably pleased with the direction it's taking the world in when it comes to governmental action, corporate goals and so on. 

Outside of people like Hansen, most people who seriously criticize the agreement seem to be laymen like you and me. On that front I'd keep away from criticizing Paris until 2020, when the second talks will happen for countries to write their second pledges, which is arguably the main important mechanic of it.
