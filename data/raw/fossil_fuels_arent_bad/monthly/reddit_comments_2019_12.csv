Wrong. Global warming has absolutely nothing to do with the greenhouse effect (aka convection limiting).

Co2 absorbs IR at specific wavelengths... it also EMITS just as well. AKA its a better conductor of heat then normal air. Because of this ability to conduct those specific wavelengths of light more efficently, Co2 is predicted to lower upper atmospheric temperatures, which contracts the global surface area of the ""atmopsheric window"" where Co2 finally allows IR through to space(around 2.7 and 15 um). This contraction is the where the heating is predicted to come from.

For visualization, imagine a fluffy ball of wire, with a piece of red hot plutonium inside. the wire conducts heat away from the plutonium core and radiates it into space. The plutonium is earth and the wire is the atmosphere. Co2 has the effect of increasing the thermal conductivity(plastic to cooper) of the wires(atmosphere) to such a degree that the entire ball of wires shrinks, reducing surface area that can radiate heat. The core of plutonium is still putting off X number of watts, but in a smaller ball of wire. Because the ball of wire shrunk, the temperature delta would be greater, and thus any point inside of the surface layer would be marginally hotter.

To date... this has not been proven... mostly because there is no evidence that the [Mie scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering) layer has actually lowered in altitude, as climate models predicted. We are talking about 5-10 meters of change for this layer, at 5-10 km in altitude.

Wind turbines do not use wood in their blades due to the weight that would require and the adverse effect that would have on the strength of the blade. Fiber-reinforced epoxy or unsaturated polyester is much stronger, lighter weight, and doesnt fly apart under its own momentum like wood would (lol). Its kinda why they use it...

Its basically 6-10 inch thick specialized fiberglass. At this thickness the composite is nothing like the quarter inch or less thick old fashioned fiberglass surrounding your boat. More like lightweight steel.  It is amazing to look at theses blades and understand the complexity of these seemingly simple blades. The blade or airfoil needs to have smooth contours as much as possible. Any noise is air resistance and any sharp edge will allow harmonics to build up or cause stress points. Harmonics obviously destroy the drive train. A good blade design is crucial.

Let's say I made the final decision on this. It's fair to assume that I had the public on one side asking for investment into renewables, and a shady fossil fuel company on the other side who I've got a preexisting relationship with.

The most financially beneficial action for me would be to ask the lobbyists to funnel me cash in exchange for sabotaging the project, then follow through on that by going with an unfeasibly cheap option and diverting excess funds to areas that get me votes.

Win-win for me, win-win for my fossil fuel friends who benefit from both the shitty service quality of the renewables and the public losing faith in them when a wind turbine crumbles.

# What is the Aerosol Masking Effect?


We've landed ourselves in a situation of harrowing irony where our emissions have both risen CO2 and bought us time in the process. This is because dirty coal produces sulfates which cloud the atmosphere and act as a sunscreen, reflecting incoming heat back out of our atmosphere. This sunscreen has prevented the level of warming we **should** have seen by now, but have avoided (kinda, keep reading). [Here’s good example of this on a smaller scale:]( https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610007/were-about-to-kill-a-massive-accidental-experiment-in-halting-global-warming/)
>In effect, the shipping industry has been carrying out an unintentional experiment in climate engineering for more than a century. Global mean temperatures could be as much as 0.25 ˚C lower than they would otherwise have been, based on the mean “forcing effect” 

 * Much has been done in the way of researching the extent of this effect. Currently it is understood that [Anthropogenic aerosols have already brought about a decrease of ∼2.53 K, Experiments based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 given in IPCC AR5 shows the dramatic decrease in three anthropogenic aerosols in 2100 will lead to an increase of ∼2.06 K]( https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4613)


That's not to say that we have **truly** avoided this warming. We simply ""kick the can"" down the road with these emissions. The warming is still there waiting, until the moment we no longer emit these sulfates. 

* [Just 35% reduction in industrial output(emissions) would lead to 1C temperature rise](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgrd.50192). Depending on which scientist you ask, it could be as little as a week, or it could be up to 6 weeks. [Here is a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/418601a) in Nature which analyzed change in temperature due to absence of sulfate cloud cover from airlines for the 3 days immediately following 9/11 when planes over the US were grounded (it's pay-walled but can be accessed [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11218772_Climatology_Contrails_reduce_daily_temperature_range)).  A temperature change over North America of 1C was recorded. 1C temperature rise in 3 days just from absence of air travel. Warming that will occur when shipping industry transitions to clean coal or from economic disruption will be much greater.

Regardless though of how abruptly it occurs, the warming is still there on the horizon.   

   * Worse though, [It's been recently discovered this effect is actually more potent than we previously had estimated](https://phys.org/news/2019-01-cooling-effect-aerosols-cumulus-msc.html?fbclid=IwAR1AyPkeQ2JlWu5bs1r6uwGlBrOciNWlJ9t57XMQ3KlGMQBun7JPLfh2r-g), by twice as much. Life on Earth cannot adapt to abrupt warming like this. Additionally, warming like this serves to amplify the rate of loss of sea ice, methane emissions (described below), and a number of other systems.

We have overcome this problem by the use of new polarimetric satellite retrievals of the relevant aerosol properties (aerosol number, size, shape). The resulting estimate of RFaci = −1.14 Wm−2 (range between −0.84 and −1.72 Wm−2) is more than a factor 2 stronger than the IPCC estimate that includes also other aerosol induced changes in cloud properties.
