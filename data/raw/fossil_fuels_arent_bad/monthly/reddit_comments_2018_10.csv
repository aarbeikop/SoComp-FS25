or we build 2000 fusion reactors by 2035 and begin using them to draw down as well.

we're simply not headed for those results.  the result we're headed for is clear: we will try to accomplish some modest improvements for the future without upsetting the economics today.  this is our culture, discounting the future, completely devoid of usufruct.

i think we will see avoidance and denial in wealthy countries, and we will build walls and teach courses in lifeboat ethics.  famines, war, and disease will be ending hundreds of millions of lives early, and peak population looks likely around 2035.

then we can change.","2018-10-10 04:05:07","16","systemrename","1747940585.500045","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

Nonsense.  While I wish this was true, it's not.  Look it up.  In the real world, electric cars take power from the most marginal production, which by definition means the very dirtiest power plants that are connected to the grid.  Unfortunately, that's how the grid works.  Most people have no idea about that.

Electric cars make exactly the same carbon pollution as internal combustion engines.  They just emit carbon from power plants, not mufflers.

( The real electric cars were invented a long time ago.  They are called bicycles.)","2018-10-10 06:11:08","2","NF-31","1747940585.506828","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
