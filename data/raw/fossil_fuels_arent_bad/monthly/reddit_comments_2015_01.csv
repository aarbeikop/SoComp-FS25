If you are honestly looking for a way to mitigate or cut back on our impact, look no further then your day-to-day activities. Drive a car? Try public transportation, biking or walking. Have a lightbulb? Check and see if you have the most efficient ones financially available. Try your best to buy food from local sources, even better cut back on eating meat (check out how much the agriculture industry generates greenhouse gases). Too much to ask for? Plant a tree or pay an organization that will plant them on your behalf. There is so much you can do right now.

"cnr73se","t3_2smy6z","2smy6z","environment","emotional","If the problem we’re addressing is AGW, or climate change, then the solution is reducing greenhouse gases that contribute to the problem. If you want to address the solution to the fullest extent, both immediately and permanently then 1) humans must choose all actions that reduce or eliminate their contribution (in any way) to greenhouse gas emissions 2) develop an economic system that allows people to choose all actions that reduce or eliminate their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions 3) develop an infrastructure that allows people to choose all actions that reduce or eliminate their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions

Here are the specific actions, starting with the most impactful, you can choose to take right now to reduce your contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.

1) **Change your diet. Stop eating meat, fish, and animal products.** If you’re not a farmer who understands and practices sustainable farming, then this is the most impactful action you take, even if you think your meat is being raised sustainably because the store told you so. If you are a farmer and you raise your own cow, chicken, or pig sustainably, then please see #2. Here are some of the environmental impacts of meat, fish, and animal product consumption:

* Direct carbon dioxide emissions into atmosphere created by burning of fossil fuels required for transportation of meat.
* Destruction of natural systems that store and consume greenhouse gases, such as rainforest and ecosystem destruction for land space required to raise animals and grow grains to feed the animals. (There is a disproportionate amount of grains for every portion of meat)
* High water demand required to grow crops for animals.
* Methane produced in the digestion process of animals.
* Groundwater contamination created by animal waste.
* Species extinction due to overfishing.

2) **Change your mode of transportation. Stop driving, flying, and boating. Live locally.** Combustion of fossil fuels is the leading cause of carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas. And transportation, after only electricity generation, creates the highest demand for fossil fuel combustion in the United States and most developed countries. Consider what your life would be like without a car. Understand realistically how you could make this change work. How many hours would you extra hours would you have to spend commuting? Sell your car, embrace walking, and start biking or taking the bus. Plan to spend that extra couple of hours commuting to and from work, or bring a change of clothes if you bike. Don’t travel via plane or drive anywhere unless you absolutely have to! Sorry, mom!

3) **Change your consumption habits. Stop buying anything that doesn’t contribute to a sustainable world.** The goal here is to create Zero Waste. The only things that you need to buy on a regular basis are a few toiletries and food. Makeup and clothes are not toiletries. Stop buying paper towels. Buy from thrift shops or at garage sales. If you do have to buy things, buy something that will last for your lifetime. Buy from thrift shops or at garage sales. Planned obsolescence is a common practice that businesses use to keep the consumer coming back and consuming, again and again. Do not touch disposables. You can buy unpackaged soap and use it for shampoo and all your toiletry needs. This action can even be extended to stop spending money on anything not affecting the environment positively. Things like canceling your television subscription or not going to movies.

4) **Change your diet some more. Stop eating overly packaged or processed foods.** Again, the goal here is Zero Waste. Foods with lots of packaging can be an indicator that what you’re purchasing is not good for the environment. One way to avoid packaging is to bring your produce net to the farmers market and use whole foods, like fruits and vegetables, to make meals from scratch. Get rid of the chips, McDonalds, or ice cream. No more processed sodas, coffee, tea or alcohol (seriously!). Just drink water, it’s cheap and easy. Anything that doesn’t serve a healthy purpose in your diet should be minimized or eliminated. The reason for this is because processed foods unnecessarily put a huge demand on our environment when whole foods and unprocessed foods will suffice. Purchasing packaged foods supports the increasingly complex waste streams that have infiltrated every corner of our society. 

5) **Stop creating a demand for electricity.** No lights, no heat. Open windows, use blankets and layer clothing for heat. No computer, no phone. Use email as a means of communication and use libraries or places that have shareable access to computers. Wash your clothes by hand. Hang dry outside.

6) **Change your job or career. Start working for the world!** Some obvious degrees like Environmental Studies, Environmental Science, and Environmental Engineering don’t even scratch the surface of the endless amount of degrees that can be used to benefit the environment. That’s because all degrees can be used to benefit the environment.

7) **Change the way you spend your free time. Start volunteering.** Get out there in the world and get your hands dirty. Volunteer for organizations that do litter cleanups and habitat restoration projects. Or volunteer in a community garden. By volunteering, we are not only directly helping the planet, but we are showing that we won’t let money limit our ability to make the world a better place.

8) **Donate your money to an environmental cause.**

9) **Educate yourself on the issues.**

10) **Get involved politically.**

11) **Talk to others about the problems and solutions.**

12) **Practice proper waste disposal. Reuse, recycle, and compost.** Take the time to know what your jurisdiction’s waste collector accepts in the garbage, recycling, and compost. If you don’t have a residential compost collection program to participate in, this is a great opportunity to find a neighbor or somewhere that does, and write or call your local city government and express an interest in composting.

If you do these things, you’re doing everything you can pretty much do, whether or not you think it’s enough. This is how we live sustainably. If we can get more people to live like this, we will begin to see the changes we want and naturally, the systems, economically and politically, will start to adapt to our habits. 

 If enough people do these things, we will probably see degrowth in our economy, which is actually a good thing because we judge how good our economy is by how much we consume. This “degrowth” has the potential to be so impactful that we could ultimately cause an economic collapse, which shows that our economic system, capitalism, is currently not compatible with a sustainable, minimal-greenhouse-gas-emissions lifestyle. As “radical” or “extreme” as this sounds, it’s exactly the change we really need. Capitalism not only facilitates greenhouse-gas-emitting lifestyles, but I believe that capitalism encourages this unsustainable lifestyle that is one of the underlying problems of climate change. This is where the solution is anyones guess and often where people feel uneasy about talking about the solution. Can you think of a new economic system and how to implement it for seven billion people? Uh, yeah, me neither. I think we’re going to need to start volunteering our time and making sacrifices to our current sense of entitlement to luxuries.

We need to start seriously considering how we can live with seven billion people on this world in harmony with our environment. I think developing a new infrastructure is an important part of the solution that also solves the underlying problem. My crazy, sustainability minded imagination dreams of 5-10 condensed mega-cities, in areas that can be inhabited sustainably.
