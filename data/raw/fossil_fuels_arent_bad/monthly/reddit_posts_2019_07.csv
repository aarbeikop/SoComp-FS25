He topped it off by saying look at Al Gore and his predictions and since he was wrong and profited off it, that obviously everyone who says that climate change is real is a hack. I’m concerned because I know that there are people who share these views and who will bury their heads in the sand until cities are under water, and say “but there wasn’t evidence, we couldn’t have known, you can’t blame us!” When reality catches up.

"ck46c6","collapse","skeptical","Should society encourage suicide as part of the solution?","Human societies have traditionally frowned upon the idea of suicide. It's a taboo-topic, viewed as something negative, 'sinful', whatever. A person's close circle would consider suicide bad considering the grief it would create for the loss.

However, we have close to 8 Billion people on the planet. The lives of vast majority of them are dependent on fossil fuels in one way or another. The planet can't sustain that many people, this has become obvious. 

There has to be a massive mental shift in the society for the change and one important shift is about the topic of death. Nowadays death is a taboo topic, something people fear. But for the first time ever 'death' would be a positive outcome, a necessary sacrifice for the future of the planet. Should society encourage euthanasia for everyone, who would want it?

Heck, I myself am still using tap water, I'm using electricity, I will be using heating in winter. These are my big ""sins"" at this stage. I'm not interested in attempting to survive alone somewhere in the forest. What's the point? For the first time ever I'm concluding that suicide is the ultimate ""good"" solution in reducing the carbon footprint, which would be the best possible outcome for the greater good of the planet.

Generally speaking I still think the decision of suicide should be well argued, it shouldn't be used to as an ""easy way out"" in solving every life matter. Killing yourself on the back of every small problem which you don't want to face. However, we have reached an era, where the arguments that can be put forward in favour of suicide have become significant, and could be encouraged to use as a shift in the society in general. After all, I view euthanasia as a better solution than the looming resource wars, where many people would be killed anyway, but much more violently.","2019-07-31 05:44:34","30","35","0.69","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ck46c6/should_society_encourage_suicide_as_part_of_the/","True","202020212022","1747944362.606097","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"c8babu","collapse","skeptical","Done with posts about incredulity over governments both highlighting climate emergency, and then doubling down on fossil fuel production...","I get it. 

Governments are hypocritical. 

More and more of them are proclaiming climate emergencies, and then doubling down on fossil fuel production.

Oh, my! Don’t they know? Don’t they care? What idiots!!

Except that… 

There’s nothing we have to replace the foundation of fossil fuel energy in our society. Nothing. Globally, we use 100 million barrels of oil a day. Still. Today, we’ll burn through that much. And, tomorrow, and the day after that. 

We don’t burn that much oil (not to mention coal, methane as “natural gas”, diesel, kerosene) because we find it _funny_. We burn it because that’s what we’re using. We ship products. We refrigerate produce. We heat buildings where it’s cold. We cool buildings where it’s hot (hint: more and more places are too hot to live without AC). We move goods between countries and within countries. Almost nothing anyone uses comes from their country any more, in many cases. We pump water and sewage. We have lights when we flick the switch. We run trains and make tires and produce newspapers. Every single thing we touch, eat, and use, was produced with at least some energy coming from fossil fuels. 

This is our modern society. Nobody, _en masse_, is making any significant drive to change this. Germany uses as much coal now as they did in 1990. Hydro is not forever and has massive impacts on riparian areas. The dams get silted up, clogged with logs, and eventually, they crumble from age. Most rivers in the world that can be dammed, already are. 

Solar and wind are solarpunks’ wet dreams, but even if the EROEI was better (it’s not great), manufacturing them takes fossil fuel energy for numerous of the steps to manufacture and ship. We don’t really know how to recycle either solar or wind turbines when they cease working. But, the two big problems with these sources of energy are that 1.) we don’t want to build batteries, be they mechanical or electrochemical that are big enough to make up for the intermittency, and 2.) we don’t want to build the massive electrical grid we would need to move the power around from where it is more sunny to where the electricity is needed. 

Nobody wants to build nuclear, so there’s not much point discussing it here. Which country anywhere is talking about a massive nuclear roll-out? Nobody. I’m not convinced that current nuclear is carbon-neutral enough to get the job done, anyway. It takes a lot of fossil fuels to build and run a reactor. 

So, that means that yes, we know we have almost three trillion extra tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, that the permafrost is melting, and that this will spew forth untold billions or trillions of tons of methane into the atmosphere, and that we may have tripped a number of other thresholds that we cannot come back from. If we lose global dimming, for example, if we actually did stop emitting the particulate matter into the atmosphere from fossil-fuel-burning sources, we would see a nearly immediate global average temperature increase from that. At +4C, tropical clouds stop forming as well, and that may bump us up by another +8C. Others have identified other thresholds, like there being a Blue Ocean Event in the Arctic. 

On the one hand, then, we have a colossal problem, threatening not only our way of life, but our very existence, and on the other, we’ve got social and political systems designed around keeping voters happy. Voters don’t vote to make themselves unhappy. Politicians can’t get bills passed that nobody supports. Governments are not designed to be innovative, nor move quickly. 

This is the central catastrophe. We want to keep going as we’re going, but we know that doing so will kill us. We have built a fragmented global society where individual nations, by and large, have autonomy to do whatever they’d like. China and India laugh at us in the West when we ask them to cut their emissions. They say, ‘sure, I’ll do that when my people live like your people’. In the West, nobody _really_ is doing enough to cut their footprint, except blisteringly poor people. 

So why the incredulity? 

Look, we know! Fossil fuels bad! But, we also like _eating_, don’t we? What grocery stores sell only local permaculture foods? Some, sure, but what percentage of the whole country’s caloric intake comes from food produced in that manner? I’m willing to bet it’s under 5%. Walking, transit, and bicycling sound like low-carbon ways of transporting, but they all still require energy of some sort. Walking is actually more energy intensive than transit is, per person per mile, when you factor in food requirements and the caloric requirement there, ultimately satisfied by fossil fuels. LEED buildings? Fossil fuels still burnt making them. Vertical farms? LOL. 

Because here’s the second catch: even if we all lived as frugally (because that’s the biggest single factor influencing someone’s “decision” to be “green”) as the poorest of us in the West, if we all had a 300 sq. ft. apartment, ate only vegan, didn’t have a phone or computer, walked everywhere, and worked locally, wore warm clothes inside when it was cold (no heat) and “dealt with it” when it was hot (moving away from the equator), **there are too many of us globally to all live like that**. Go find a footprint calculator, punch in all the lowest possible values for every category, and then multiply that footprint by 8 billion. I dare you. 

So, for ****’s sake, please stop being so _incredulous_ about governments approving fracking licenses, pipelines, new coal plants, or still running “business as usual”. We’re not going to stop doing that until it’s too late, and even if we did, there are too many of us for all of us to live like a Western Poor. Democracies can’t force people to do things without becoming authoritarian, and nobody _wants_ that. We’re so far past _voluntary choices_ being able to “get us there”, anyway, and even if we did, there are too many of us for that to work. 

In the meantime, democracies have voters who want stuff like AC and cell phones and Reddit and food. I’m not _apologizing for it_, but explaining that, from my perspective, we will not see any meaningful slow-down of absolutely anything in any sense that is either _planned_ or _voluntary_. 

This will ultimately, I think, make collapse worse when it hits the state in question, any state, but because of the situation and the double Catch 22 we are in, there’s nothing to do for it. We’re not changing in time, and even if we did, it’d be grossly insufficient. 

The _only solution_ to the current set of existential human problems we face would be 1.) a composite of a non-violent adoption of a new, more equitable, global-centric form of government that _somehow managed to avoid the many known problems of communism_ (not holding my breath), and 2.) solved the relatively minor issues (vs. communism) that are baked into the capitalist system, coupled with a 3.) major de-populating programme, also coupled with coming up with 4.) a miracle form of zero carbon energy (including in its materials-sourcing and manufacture) that could scale up to replace all the carbon-sourced energy we’re using now, plus 5.) had enough surplus energy to then suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and bury it in a geologically stable way. 

Then, we only would need to deal with the existential threats of 6.) super-bugs, pandemics, 7.) the diseases of modern society like diabesity, heart disease, stroke, cancer, depression, etc., 8.) pollution both nuclear and otherwise, 9.) global weapon proliferation, 10.) massive global racial tensions (e.g. in South Africa), and related issues of relative deprivation that cause cultural jealousy and resentment, 11.) biodiversity loss, 12.) bee colony collapse, 13.) international conflicts, 14.) natural disasters including asteroid strikes, 15.) geological disasters like the risk of Yellowstone erupting, or major earthquakes, 16.) fresh water shortages, 17.) sub-replacement fertility issues vis-à-vis chemical, EMF, and nuclear pollution, 18.) economic fakery that results in a collapse, etc. 

So stop being so surprised that governments still burn fossil fuels. Those fuels are what enabled our population to grow and what enabled us to live as historically-well as we are living. There will be no easy or voluntary transition to the future without miracle technology and energy sources. Get used to the hypocrisy, but realize that it’s not because of our stupidity, but the _impossibility of the situation_.","2019-07-02 16:25:50","31","16","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c8babu/done_with_posts_about_incredulity_over/","True","dresden_k","1747944392.154969","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

Joseph Heath: [Hobbes's difficult idea](http://induecourse.ca/hobbess-difficult-idea/). The problem with climate change isn't *awareness*, it's *incentives*. If I switch from burning fossil fuels to some more expensive carbon-free form of energy, I bear all the costs, but the benefits (in terms of reduced climate disruption) are spread out over the entire world. **Because the costs to me outweigh the benefits, I don't do it**.

So how do you resolve this problem? [Matthew Yglesias explains](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/10/17959686/carbon-tax): you use a steadily rising carbon price to make fossil fuels more expensive compared to alternatives, giving each person a direct self-interest in switching, and you use a climate club to put pressure on other countries to do the same.","2019-07-30 15:08:39","15","12","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cjt2ek/climate_hobbess_difficult_idea_cooperation_is/","True","russilwvong","1747944401.555428","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"cglkt8","sustainability","action-oriented","Economic Reasons Against the Trans Mountain Pipeline (British Columbia-Alberta dispute)","My Dad (unsurprisingly) told me that he wants the Trans Mountain Pipeline to be built. Naturally, I asked for his arguments and we had some back and forth. Like most arguments, the evident conclusion is that we value different things: I value the environment, particularly biodiversity, whereas he values economic stability. However, I had a hard time countering his arguments without just restating my own arguments: the costs of climate change will outweigh any benefit that pipeline provides, we cannot invest further in fossil fuels, it is inconsistent with our responsibility towards climate justice, and we have absolutely no right to place a pipeline on unceded Indigenous land. 

&#x200B;

My Dad's primary arguments are that we must build the pipeline to generate the money required for research and technological advances in the renewable energy sector, and the world runs on oil. I argued that 1) there is already a pipeline running oil, so opposing this pipeline expansion is not the same as opposing all oil exports and 2) lack of a pipeline will enhance the need for renewable energy and therefore give more incentive to research. I don't believe that communities currently supporting the pipeline project are going to suddenly begin valuing the environment, so I want to be aware of economic arguments against the pipeline.

&#x200B;

My question is **what arguments do you have against the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion that do not necessarily rely on valuing the environment more than the economy (ie. economic arguments)?**","2019-07-23 00:41:15","3","2","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cglkt8/economic_reasons_against_the_trans_mountain/","True","TemporaryOwl1","1747944449.705004","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
