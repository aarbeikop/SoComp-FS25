"d2njzz","climate","scientific","Global warming could be the big filter explaining the fermi paradox."," The fermi paradox states that considering the age of The universe, we  should be able to observe other more advanced zivilisations out  there,yet we dont. One explanation is that there is something called the  big filter, something that prevents intelligent life to continue  advancing. For example the invention of nuclear warfare was speculated  to wipe out any civilizations that discover it. While us humans are  pretty good at not wiping us out with nukes so far, that's probably  because we know and fear the immediate danger that comes with nukes.  Climate change on the other hand is very subtle and takes a very long  time to be noticeable. Yet the amount of green house gases we set free  will cause the climate to heat up for multiple degrees even if we  stopped burning fossil fuels etc. right now. We are evolutionary not  very good at making the connection between things that we do today and  the consequences it will have down the road I.e. smoking. It's not  farfetched to speculate that intelligent life on other planets will have  similar limitations due to natural evolution. And so far we are on a  very bad projectory, risking warming the planet by six degrees which  will by itself cause some ecosystems to collapse and surely reach some  tipping points like thawing permafrost that will accelerate global  warming even more. Sorry for the long read but I am scared of our  inability to handle this crisis.","2019-09-11 09:43:49","14","8","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/d2njzz/global_warming_could_be_the_big_filter_explaining/","True","Griffonguy","1747944952.140907","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

"d6i6y0","collapse","skeptical","Solving climate change is easy","The world has to reach zero CO2 emissions by 2060. How is this accomplished?

All we need to do is switch from coal and natural gas, to renewable electricity.

And then we need to shift from combustion engines to cars that drive on electricity.

And [to avoid rare mineral shortages](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/107058/uk-electric-cars-will-require-twice-the-world-s-supply-of-cobalt), we will probably have to convince some people to stop driving and switch to public transport.

And air travel will have to be a thing of the past, because battery energy density would need to improve by [two orders of magnitude](http://energyskeptic.com/2019/why-arent-there-battery-powered-airplanes/), to allow us to fly on electricity.

And we'll have to transition to [electric trucks](http://energyskeptic.com/2015/all-electric-trucks-not-going-to-happen/).

And then we'll have to power the world's big freight ships with sails or some other alternative method.

But then we can stop depending on fossil fuels for electricity and transportation.

We would then need to figure out a way to [stop using coal in our steel production](https://www.ft.com/content/3bcbcb60-037f-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1).

We'd have to shift the global concrete industry to a method that doesn't emit CO2, as [4% of global CO2 emissions are just from the chemical process we use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_concrete#Carbon_dioxide_emissions_and_climate_change).

The heavy manufacturing we do would have to shift too. We'll have to use roughly [two to three](http://ourrenewablefuture.org/chapter-5/) times more energy to generate the electricity that will power our heat intensive manufacturing processes, than the fossil fuels that we currently use.

But all of that should be a cakewalk. Now we can start focusing on the other problems, that will also have to be tackled. Cattle and other animals emit methane and lead to other greenhouse gas emissions, so people will have to change their diets. Beef consumption in the EU will have to [decline by 90%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown) before 2050. Instead, these people will have to start eating nuts and legumes.

We'll probably have to [stop using plastic](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180801182009.htm), because it emits greenhouse gasses when it decays in the sun, or simply ends up as carbon in our atmosphere when we burn it. The plastic we have already released into the environment will just continue to leach greenhouse gasses into our atmosphere. I'll skip over the health and ecological effects beyond the impact on global warming.

Another 3% of our current global CO2 emissions come from [coal fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-seam_fire). You dig a mine in the ground, some coal enters in contact with the air, then it can spontaneously ignite when the conditions are right. What determines whether a coal deposit exposed to the air will spontaneously ignites? The ambient temperature. Ouch. As we expose more coal deposits to the air through mining activities, plenty of such fires are likely to occur around the world, so we will want firefighting teams to address these underground fires too. We want the same to happen to the [peat fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat#Peat_Fires), which occur spontaneously in response to new weather patterns that bring extreme heats to places not used to extreme heat.

Most of the coral reefs start dying [before we hit 1.5 degree Celsius](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1674), so we'll have to implement some sort of weather modification program too, or artificially rebuild the coral reefs, assuming we want to feed the hundreds of millions of people who depend on the reefs and preserve the species that inhabit the reef. We'll probably need [some sort of geoengineering program in the Arctic](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48069663) too, to reverse the positive feedback of sea ice loss.

We'll have to implement [conservation programs](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190725100433.htm), to revive the dying elephant populations in Africa that ensure the African forests store high amounts of carbon dioxide.

There are some minor long-lived greenhouse gasses we'll have to stop using too, like [sulphur hexafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride#Greenhouse_gas). We'll also have to get rid of CFC's and HFC's.

Because we've waited too long with reducing CO2 emissions, we'll also need to develop negative emissions technologies that will have to be deployed somewhere in the latter half of this century. There are none we know of today that have been conclusively shown to be feasible, but perhaps we'll think of some.

TL:DR; It's pretty easy, get rid of the fossil fuel subsidies, vote for your local green party, become a flexitarian, recycle your plastic, fly to a vacation destiny nearby and the problem is solved.","2019-09-19 18:31:09","52","18","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d6i6y0/solving_climate_change_is_easy/","True","baibaiguis","1747945219.3607428","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
