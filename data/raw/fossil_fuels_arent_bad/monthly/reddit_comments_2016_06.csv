Existentialism was a big topic for me in my late teens, early 20's. I went from Hesse to Nietzsche to Sartre to Camus without pause and, I suppose, forced myself to deal with existential nihilism straight away. All I can say is that I'm in my 40's, quite happy and well-adjusted and though I completely avow the absurdity of existence, I've found it to be the basis for hope and the  kernel for a life full of love, friendship, and possibilities.

For me, the answer came from Aleister Crowley's Law of Thelema: ""Do what Thou Wilt, shall be the whole of the law. Love is the law, love under will."" The first part is classic Nihilism and sadly, often quoted without the second, more important, part. The second part, to me says, Yes, everything is permitted but understand your actions will either increase or decrease your happiness; you can be an agent of chaos (death instinct) or an agent of order (life instinct). If you reject death and choose life, the only path to that is through love (the force not the emotion)  and the only way express love is through the force of will (it won't happen on it's own; life doesn't make itself). So, if you find that you value your existence, then you need to bend your will toward creation. If you don't value your existence, then you should snuff it or come to terms with the fact that you do and then bend your will toward love and creation. 

I think the issue today is that we have a number of factors that bring people to the edge of the abyss (people are mostly intelligent) but very few tools to navigate the existential dread. Take for example, the sort-of neo-atheist movement that's all the rage these days. There is a never-ending chorus of people who will tell you God is dead and religion is the great evil, but the discussion ends there. What is it replaced with? Platitudes that goodness doesn't come from heaven, it was inside you all along? Notions that science and knowledge are an end in themselves? No wonder religious people reject Atheism so vehemently; the scaffolding was removed without installing the rigging. I was raised in the church (mom was a preacher) and though I rejected Christianity around 14 or 15, I think it gave me the tools I needed to find an answer that worked for me (tools, I'm sad to say, my 18 year old atheist, anxiety riddled, dysmorphic daughter does not have--i digress). Maybe it was also an education system and parents who pushed me toward critical thinking and compassion rather than skills training and competition. Maybe I'm just lucky and privileged (I'm obviously both), or maybe I'm just an outlyer. But I'm pretty sure that being metaphysically disabled is going to leave a person empty and destitute and that's where many people find themselves these days.  

As for a new mythology, I agree we need it. I'm not sure what it will be, maybe something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ1KZvzXpKI)

Anyway, sorry if I got too hippy-dippy.","2016-06-08 22:56:46","10","sethinthebox","1747911671.58071","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"d41p44g","t3_4n711w","4n711w","collapse","skeptical","I agree with some of the nihilist views that you showcased, like that life has no intrinsic value and that nothing can ever be known or communicated, but I differ in that ""this line of thought leaves you devoid of any belief, except maybe a will to destroy.""

See, if you truly deny the existence of everything in your perception, you deny your own conscience, you deny life itself and death as well, you are left with the absolutes, with the objectiveness that is your own body and the chemical processes that form it. You cannot not believe in those, because that turns the whole basis of this philosophy into a contradiction. You cannot deny the existence of the means that allow you to deny the existence of said means.

Philosophy applied to life is confusing indeed.

So, having said that, I think that a true nihilist would behave like an animal, devoid of any desires other than those that makes him/her able to keep denying the existence of everything else other than oneself. Those would be to eat and to defecate and to preserve its own life until death. In that sense a nihilist society would just have stayed in the hunting gathering stage, beause it is the minimum possible form of development at which people can survive and still be denying the rest of civilization.

I think that today's society is a mixture of schizophrenic-psychosis and psychopathy. People know thae true value of things, yet they still value their pleasure, their wellness and their fortune even if it means their ultimate end. Like an obese person that cannot help itself when faced with cake, like a drug addict that can only think in the next fix, modern society pursues the illusion of happiness through consumption, and the ones that pull the strings to keep this unsustainable model going, are actually laughing their asses off, because they don't care if the pleasure they experience now kills everybody else, even themselves.

So when, you say that modern society has no purpose, I disagree. Its only purpose is to seek for the next thrill, to increase the gap between the rich and the poor, and ultimately to exhaust every last resource just because it can.

Sadly religion does not have a place anymore, I would argue that it has been the cause or at least the foundation of a lot of the problems we face today, specially the spread of catholicism. As such, your final solution is not necessary. See, it doesn't matter what people think, it is what they are able to do what counts. Even if people loved nature, they would still need to eat, they would still feel the desire to procreate, they would still covet the belongings of their neighbors. So what needs to be done is to change the basis on which society functions, not their beliefs. If the ability to destroy ecosystems on a large enough scale is not there, then no matter how psychotic or psychopathic the fat dogs are, no one would be able to do any significant harm.

That's a choice, I went with [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)

>Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions;
Stoic ethics taught freedom from ""passion"" by following ""reason"". 

>The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute ""askēsis"" that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm.

I see this in Einstein, for example

*Few people are capable of expressing with*  **equanimity** *opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.* - Albert Einstein

Which I always found one major problem, personally and collectively: The need to have some kind of myth, but the arbitrariness of its content. Myths are traditionally an emergent thing, they grow out of circumstance, like a tree. You couldn't command an acorn to ""chose"" what it wants to look like as an oak. It would be totally hopeless, as that wisdom was never in the acorn itself: It is in the environment and the relationships between the acorn and the environment.

But now, in the absense of our natural environment, we find ourselves in the spot of that acorn, without myth, forced to choose between arbitrary ideologies or meaninglessness. Lots of people solve this dilemma by adopting ""functional"" or ""life-enhancing"" myths, which are supposedly not arbitrary but rational or even scientific - consumer capitalism, career orientation, techno utopianism, etc.

Yet, those supposedly rational myths are precisely what will hasten our collapse. Their personal salvation is our collective demise.

I'm not sure if I made any sense, or was even on topic, but that's what I felt when I read your post. Outstanding contribution to this sub, thank you.","2016-06-09 12:10:59","2","Faulgor","1747911671.588747","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
