The earth is a fine tuned self regulating machine just like the human body.  Both of them can take a lot of abuse before getting sick.

The earth is getting sick here is why.

Us little humans critters, 7.5 billion of us and counting are crawling all over her.  She can handle that pretty well except the Co2 problem is making her sick.

The earth has a tremendous amount of stored energy coal, oil and natural gas in her belly.  Well us crafty humans critters figured out that if we drill and mine her belly we can use this stuff to power factories, cars, jets, homes etc, fantastic.

Well there is a problem, in all that coal, oil and gas is a blast from the past.  Forest, plants and animals that got buried and smashed for millions of years turns naturally into fossil stuff like lumps of coal and sticky oil.

But what people dont know is that when all the plants were alive they absorbed, grabbed, tackled, hugged and stored Co2 by the mega super load.

So when the little squeeky human critters figured out they could burn this and turn it into power they went happy crazy.

The problem is, when these fossil fuels are burnt the carbon atom pops out into the air like a wet soap bar out of ur hands in the shower.  It floats into the atmosphere and stays there for a long long time.  

You will here it explained like this, “there is umpteen giggly mega super metric tonnes of Carbon in the atmosphere”.  Us human critters minds and eyes glaze over, can’t comprehend it, me either.

So here is what happens.  The Co2 atoms are side by side and bend and lock arms to form a coat/blanket over the earth.  Like if we are to wear a clear plastic bag over us what happens. We get sticky and hot. The earth is the same. 

When the sun rays hit the earth a lot ricochets right back up to outter space especially off of clouds of frozen sea ice. But the Co2 is like a clear plastic bag over the earth that holds all that ricocheded sunlight energy in.   Like a green house does, that is where they coined the term “green house effect”.

That clear plastic bag of Co2 also has a double whammy effect.  Co2 is one of the only gasses that stores the suns energy.  It also holds more moisture.  This is bad because it means more bigger and badder storms/tornadoes etc.

So whats the big deal if the earth warms a little?  To us human critters playing outside not much.  To the Earth, it’s a big deal.

How do u feel when ur running a temperature but feel cold.   U feel whack a doodled and dont like it.  Or when you wake up sticky and hot and whip off the blankets, AAAHHH.  The earth can’t do that.

Before the earth was just spinning round enjoying the view, doing normal weather like when we were a kid.

Well the earth cant do that anymore cause she has the Co2 plastic bag wrapped around her.  And she is getting hotter and that pushes weather currents/jet streams etc around causing irregular weather.  Like today, Chicagoland weather is 60 degrees again.  The second time in late December, (warning sssshhh).

People wonder, well doesn’t the smart earth have some way to capture Co2 and cool itself?  She sure does but us little human critters is messing that up as well.  Its called trees and oceans.

The little human critters are burning down the rain forest that stood for millions of years, burning it down at record rates and smilin ear to ear.  That is a double whammy there.  Trees capture and store Co2 which are now gone.  And when trees are burnt it releases the giggly mega tonnes of Co2 in the atmosphere. 

Not to mention the smell of burnt fur from forest animals that can’t escape like the cute koala bears. They fall to the forest floor legs up and look like a toasted black chicken in your oven.

The oceans, are huge massive heat exchangers for the earth..... Buuuuut, u guessed it, Co2 is messing that up to.

Oceans are like humans and plants.  U probably heard that plants like and only live in a certain pH level.  pH is the certain level of acidic or alkaline that we need to live in.   In simple terms, it is the tasty zone that u like/need to live in.  If us human critters pH is out of whack in our bodies, we are a sick puppies.

Co2 is absorbed by the oceans in a natural process, but when it is force fed Co2 it changes the oceans very sensitive pH level. Which is killing coral reefs at an alarming rate.  Which causes species extinctions and disrupts the oceans entire food chain. Note, one billion people survive off of the ocean.

How much disruption is too much?  Time will tell, it’s like how many jenga blocks/species can be removed/extinct before it gets tipsy turvy and collapses???? WE, U, me, kids, gkids don’t want to find out.

I just scratched the tip of the melting ice berg, so to speak.  The world is so simple, but enormously complex, it is unreal.  And WE human critters have our heads shoulder deep in the sand.  For what?  Why can’t we take off our blinders and think ahead for our kids an gkids?

One thing for sure.  If we pull our heads out of the sand, shake like a dog and let the sand go flying.....

As my wife can attest, that's exactly what I am. It's a complete mystery to me why I'm still alive, when you add all the gloom and doom and ceaseless bad jokes. But she's got profound common sense, something I'm not privy to.

The gigantic blades on the big new offshore wind turbines are made of wood, foam core, fiberglass and glue.

There's a huge wooden keel. The thickening base of the blades are made of the same stuff as storefront signage, foam core, a type of Styrofoam, The exterior of the blade is made from a layer of plywood, draped with huge sheaths of fiberglass and then soaked in glue. I believe the glue is likely formulated with alien brain dust, or nano quantum thingy dingy things.

The further out to sea, the faster the wind. These blades are 180 meters in diameter. This diameter is so big, their computer models didn't account for the fact that the wind difference between the top and bottom heights of the blades were worse than expected. Worse than expected is this sub's motto.

""Have you ever been to sea Billy"" said Captain Highliner. ""No"" said Billy, ""But I've been blown ashore."" There goes my political comedy career, but I never understood why the ocean wasn't ruled by a goddess instead of Nemo.

When you see offshore wind turbines blowing, it is very deceptive how fast they are moving because they are so huge and far away. The tips of those blades can go at 80 kilometers per hour, which I guess is 60 mph. Any ice pellets hitting those rushing blades head on a 40 mph wind would create a 100 mph impact on the glue and fiberglass coating. The blades lose balance and affect the whole stem's functional and structural integrity. All these things buckle, bend and break and have to be changed more often than expected. Remember the inaccurate wind models they're based on. Changing them is a high risk high expense operation.

Anybody who owns a fiberglass boat knows about hull rot. There are only 2 happy days for wind turbine investors, the day they buy it, and the day they sell it to taxpayers. These are the same money market investors whole built the faulty towers in upscale Australia and Toronto. There was a recent pedestrian bridge in London England that had to rebuilt after engineers or construction got it wrong. Remember the Hubble Telescope mirror? This is what happens in big money projects, corners get cut, people get graft and taxpayers get stuck, and those taxpayers won't be rich, no matter which way you vote.

The engineers who designed these things admitted in a deleted DW doc that they thought they could in effect, ""build them and forget about them"". They were wrong. All the particle pollution in the air gets coated with ice and hits those blades at another 80 kph. It's like a 120 mile per hour collision in Yankeedom. The blades cannot take the punishment and they start to become pitted which throws their balance off. These giant towers last half as long as on land, and cost 10 times more to service. They are like the F-35 fighter jets in the war on climate change.

They say offshore wind turbines produce more power, probably over 30% of their total power 90% of the time, which on land is 25% of total power 90% of the time. The problem is that offshore production in actual practice gets cut 50% in 10 years, instead of over 20 years on land. They use like a thousand times more copper and whatever than land based systems. You need extremely risky ways of changing the blades sooner than optimal, in the face of increasingly stormier conditions.

Wind turbine speeds can drop in seconds, you could have your giant offshore wind farm humming away under blue skies and within minutes red alarms flash everywhere because the wind died, and the standby fossil fuel plants have to be ready for full blast power production. This is difficult with increasing strains on old power grids. Most power grids were built in the 1960s. I got a windmill that looks 2 days older than Chomsky. I'm not climbing it.

In 1974 and 75 I was a power grid lineman in north Ontario, who's job it was to climb power grids, and check all the bolts for tightness. We also had to make sure they were safely grounded by driving steel rods into the earth connected to ground wires. They're the same as railroad tracks, if you don't take care of them, things derail, everybody's seen tracks buckle in the heat.

Claiming that we have endless offshore power to build electric cars and live on mars is extra ordinarily unethical and amoral, I have no idea what those words mean, but I know they're bad. The big power failure in England was due to a matrix glitch with the big offshore power grid. No need to know and all that I daresay.

The towers and rotors and fancy hi-tech fairy dust gear take a beating in wet salty conditions. Shortened inverter lifecycles is worse than expected. The power these offshore behemoths get cut in half in under 12 years. Nothing works as well as the engineers and scientists said it would, and it costs twice as much to fix as estimated. Maintenance costs are worse than expected (funny part) due to climate change. They break faster than expected, the funny thing is they do it every time. Basing a society on turbines and inverters is crazier than me writing sincerely and authentically.  But don't shoot me, I'm only Fart The Messenger Boy. As Bob Dylan says, the answer my friend is blowing in my wind.","2019-12-06 12:21:53","19","22","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/e6y2sn/fart_the_messenger_boy/","True","CommonEmployment","1747946513.606406","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

By Damien Cave

Dec. 6, 2019, 3:12 a.m. ET

SYDNEY, Australia — Flying into Sydney usually brings stunning views of rocky cliffs and crystal waters, but when Anna Funder looked out the window before landing this week, she saw only tragedy.

Thick gray smoke blanketed the skyline and the coast, stretching for miles from the fire front at the southwestern edge of the city, where dried-out forests have been burning for weeks.

“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Ms. Funder, an award-winning Australian novelist known for stories of cruelty and resistance. “It was this huge and terrible seam of white smoke coming up from the ground beyond which the rest of the continent — where I was headed, where my home is — was invisible.

“It was as if the country were being devoured by a chemical reaction.”

Sydney, nicknamed the “Emerald City” for its subtropical beauty, is struggling with a summer of choking smoke. Bush fires raging to the north, south and west since early November have pushed smoke and ash not just into neighborhoods abutting the blazes, but all the way to coastal suburbs more than 50 miles away.

All of us who live here can taste the fire and feel it in our throats. Asthmatics are showing up in emergency rooms in greater numbers. Schools are canceling sports and recess. In houses built to be open to the elements, people are taping their windows shut; there have even been reports of fire alarms in office buildings set off by the smoke from miles away.

And the impact of this year’s wildfire season, which began much earlier than usual, goes beyond the physical. Rising levels of angst and anger are emerging all over Sydney, spreading like the haze.


As many here see it, Australia’s conservative government, in refusing to address the threat of climate change, is favoring the country’s powerful fossil fuel industry over its largest city, as well as the rural areas where fires have already destroyed hundreds of homes.

Psychologists describe a creeping sense of impotence and dread.

“The stress based on the fact that thick smoke can accelerate pre-existing cardiovascular conditions is one thing,” said Frans Verstraten, who holds the McCaughey Chair of Psychology at the University of Sydney. “But the other kind of stress, based on the realization that there is not much we can do — helplessness; the realization that you can’t do anything about it — makes it worse.”

On social media, the sharing of images of #sydneysmoke in its many shades, from orange to gray, has become a regular feature of people’s morning routines.



Others have taken to posting photos of burned leaves that show up far from the fires, or of the darkened sun, looking as toxic and red as the blazes themselves.

In diagnostic detail, they have described how it feels to deal with the extended reach of the infernos, which are large enough to be seen from space — and are even turning glaciers in New Zealand pink.


 
State officials have warned of the dangers. The New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage said that “our network has recorded some of the highest air pollution ever seen” in the state.

In November, the department recorded 15 days of poor air quality, far beyond the monthly norm.  On Monday, the levels of PM2.5, the most harmful form of pollutant, were 22 times the accepted safety level — the equivalent of smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a day. Pollution levels were expected to reach similar heights on Friday.

Even compared to the terrible fire seasons of 1994 and 2001, “this event,” state officials said, “is the longest and the most widespread in our records.”

With fires also raging in the state of Queensland, that means the pressure on Australia’s government is likely to intensify.

Climate protests have become more common. At rallies, longtime activists are increasingly being joined by newcomers like Emily Xu, a 13-year-old student who skipped school to attend a protest on Nov. 29 in downtown Sydney.

She and a handful of her friends, all in school uniforms, said it was their first rally, and that they had made the trek because the fires had suddenly made climate change’s threats more real for them.

“Before I was like, ‘Oh, if we don’t have coal we won’t make any money for our economy,’” said Ms. Xu. Now, she said, fires were approaching her house and her friends’ houses, making her less worried about the economy than about survival.

Ms. Funder, the novelist, said the failure to address climate change was especially hard for her three children, who are 10, 15 and 17, to understand.


“I can’t explain this to my children in a way that makes adults seem like sane, moral actors,” she said. “In this story, that’s not what we are. Although in every other way we try to look out for them and their future, in this story our failure is literally choking them, keeping them indoors at school.”

In some countries, such widespread environmental effects have led to changes in policy.

Activists angry about pollution in Mexico City pushed the government to impose tougher regulations for vehicle emissions. Many academics believe China’s quick pivot to renewables in recent years was a response to air pollution and citizens’ growing concerns about its impact.

In Australia, however — where the air in Sydney was ranked among the worst in the world last month — Prime Minister Scott Morrison has resisted.

“The response has been to double down on denialism,” said David Schlosberg, director of the Sydney Environment Institute at the University of Sydney.

Instead of addressing the public’s concerns, Mr. Morrison has suggested that some forms of protest should be outlawed, while refusing to meet with retired firefighters who have warned for months that more resources are desperately needed to battle the blazes.


On Friday, Mr. Morrison merely acknowledged that the haze in Sydney “has been very distressing to people.” He recommended downloading an app that tracks the fires.

Asked about a new report questioning Australia’s stewardship of the Great Barrier Reef, which is being killed by climate change, he repeated a false assertion that Australia’s carbon emissions are declining (scientists have shown that they are still rising).

Some critics are starting to wonder how long the government’s position can last.

“I really don’t see how this governmental attack on genuine concerns, coupled with a lack of action on both emissions and adaptation policies, can stand for much longer — especially in the face of increasing disasters and emergencies,” Mr. Schlosberg said.

At the very least, the smoky conditions are forcing everyone to question their assumptions about Sydney, where fresh air and ocean breezes are treated as a daily birthright.

At the top of Sydney Tower, the city’s tallest building, Chinese tourists said they were shocked by how little they could see.

In Hyde Park, a few blocks away, Julian deCseuz, 75, sat on a bench with a mask over his face. After a few hours of use, the white cotton was already a shade of dusty brown.

“Australia has always had a bush fire problem, but I’ve never seen it this bad,” he said. “I’ve been to Beijing and to Delhi, and it’s very similar conditions.”","2019-12-07 02:43:50","86","9","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/e78oqj/australia_burns_again_and_now_its_biggest_city_is/","True","TheRealSlimLorax","1747946515.3917599","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

We've been going hard against oil and gas and frontier drilling in South African waters. I've been recently given an invite to speak on a radio station about it and this is what has been prepared for the dialogue. If any of you have poignant answers or resources I could use to help get some points about the collapse, neoliberalism, the mineral energy complex etc out there please do share.

Here's what I'm going to be speaking to :

Please find the details of the interview below:

*Interviewee:* Zangoma
*Topic:* Ocean drilling and its impact
*Date:* 10 December 2019
*Time:* 8:00 (am)
*Questions:*

1. Tell us about the impacts of ocean drilling. Are they really that bad?

2. Why have you lobbied the minister of the Department of environmentto, forests and fisheries (DEFF) to halt the venture into gas exploration off the KZN coast?

3. You would remember that a few years ago there was this massive oil spill in Mexico. And of course measures are in place to ensure this wouldn't happen. Is it one of your fears? Do you believe the assurances that this won't happen in SA?

4. What are the chances of an oil spill in this instance and what are the consequences of such an occurrence?

5. What about the economic opportunities that accompany drilling ? Especially in such tough economic times, don't you think we need it?

6. The Appeals Directorate of DEFF has given the Department, Eni and SASOL’s representatives until 11 November to respond to the all “grounds for appeal” submitted by 47 appellants who include the SDCEA and the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR). What if they respond and they choose to go ahead. What are you going to do?

Many people make money from you believing the world is ending, and have a vested interest in making you think so. Don't get me wrong, it's ending all right, but you can trust me because I'm too broke to be invested in anything, and I post all my doom and gloom for free. As in most eco-climate things, everything is worse than expected, and in this case I imagine exagerated claims are worse than expected. As usual, the debate can swing either way, but I would listen to James Hansen before ""some guy on reddit"".

The following anti-dimming report is extensive and thorough. I trust the climate organization who put it together because they're some sort of natvie American group I've followed for years. To summarize, global dimming is real and its effects are uncertain.
