>And I would argue that releasing this energy won't destroy the earth.

It's not the release of energy from burning fossil fuels that is the problem as only a small portion of fossil fuels is being burnt at any one time (I assume that's what you are talking about), It is the release of CO2 and other GHG that come from burning fossil fuels that is the main issue, as these ghg will decrease the amount of long wave radiation escaping the earth's atmosphere.  

> It will simply return the earth to the state it was in 65mil yrs ago, which apparently means a more tropical climate and no polar ice.

Not necessarily exactly the same because of the earth being an open system, the shifting of tectonic plates which effects global wind patterns and ocean currents.

> That's not the disaster which we are being lead to believe.

The fact is if the global warms it will alter weather patterns, which in turn could alter what crops we can grow in certain areas. You also have to remember that tropical climates are not the best for growing many varieties of crops (most wheat varieties) because of very poor soil conditions (nutrients are leached out in heavy rain fall), this is why the best soils around the world are found in prairie  ecosystems. 

I don't think global warming is our biggest worry right now (although it could be), I believe our biggest issue right now trying to alter our lifestyles to become more sustainable. That will help fix our intimidate issues of wildlife conservation, lowering air pollution in cities, preventing further damage to watersheds from mining, fracking and agriculture.

"cqd0hyr","t3_32nju4","32nju4","climate","scientific","You are missing the massive implications of the rate of change. The world has been much warmer at times in the distant past, it has also been a lot cooler. Life adapts along with it when the change is gradual over thousands or millions of years or takes a massive blow when there have been abrupt changes that have trigger mass extinction events. A warming trend that is noticeable on a human time scale is extremely rapid in any natural context. Each plant or animal is adapted to its particular region and its conditions. Rapid climate change disrupts and shifts these natural habitats around much faster than most species are able to adapt. An individual tree is not able to transport itself to more favourable conditions and its offspring won't be able to keep up with the changes either if it is rapid enough. Some species might be better at this than others and will shift around faster and add to the demise of more vulnerable species by competing with them for limited land and resources. Higher CO2 levels are known to increase vegetation growth but this effect may not be uniform across all plant species, some may be a lot better at taking advantage of this than others which will further disrupt complicated ecological balances. It would also be incorrect to assume that faster growing plants necessarily translates to higher yields of the crops that are vital to humanity. They might grow faster but at the cost of [changed chemical composition](http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/effects-of-rising-atmospheric-concentrations-of-carbon-13254108) providing less nutrition.","2015-04-15 11:21:09","2","hvusslax","1747896046.6843688","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

Sure.

> This means that the energy we get from fossil fuels has been on earth the whole time, 

It wasn't here the *whole* time. It came in as sunlight, generally in the same millennium that it was buried.

>it simply got trapped about 65million yrs ago.

The carboniferous era was a bit longer ago than that.

> And I would argue that releasing this energy won't destroy the earth. 

It's not the energy from the fossil fuels that causes global warming. The greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere mean that more energy from the sun is trapped.

> It will simply return the earth to the state it was in 65mil yrs ago, which apparently means a more tropical climate and no polar ice. 

This is more or less true, except it will return carbon to the biosphere, returning the greenhouse gas concentration to something similar to what is was 200 million years ago, which, as you point out, will melt the Greenland and Antarctic Ice sheets.

> That's not the disaster which we are being lead to believe.

You'll need to explain why you think that this won't affect biodiversity, agriculture and infrastructure.

> The only possible concern is that the CO2 levels increase faster that vegetation can grow to consume it.

What about 80 metres of sea level rise, forcing the relocation of most of the world's infrastructure?

What about changes to ecosystems from temperature change, including the extinction of all polar and tundra species?

What about changes to rainfall patterns, increases in droughts, and huge increases in flooding that will destroy crops, and reduce food production.

What about increases in storm energy increasing the destructiveness of cyclones and tornadoes?

> Why can't I find any studies on these things?

What search terms are you using?

If you start with the [IPCC reports on impacts](https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/report/full-report/), you'll get a lot of references from the scholarly literature.

> Are there any wholes in my argument?

Yes, there are holes.

The climate 200 million years ago is not suitable for life now, nor for infrastructure nor choice of farmland made in the climate now.

> Global warming isn't bad

Read the IPCC report on impacts linked above. Start with the technical summary.","2015-04-15 07:32:56","1","ActuallyNot","1747896046.69489","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

That's very moronic to say given how that would immediately result in the almost complete destruction of our (already unstable) agricultural system. Or in the raise of the sea levels with at least 8-12 meters.

A little known fact is that the sun is not constant, but very slowly increasing in output: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_luminosity

Eyeballing that graph, I'd say that it's only a 0.5% increase over 65mya, but even a 0.5% increase means 6W/m^2, which is highly significant. So going back to the CO2 concentrations of 65mya will result in a hotter climate than that of 65mya.","2015-04-15 09:47:07","1","bvanderspoel","1747896046.69793","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
