"3gnmjs","environment","emotional","The Marginal Footprint of Energy Consumption","In [*How Bad Are Bananas*](https://books.google.ca/books?id=iWVG2Y8nVVwC&lpg=PA147&pg=PA56), Mike Berners-Lee argues that all energy consumption is equivalent regardless of the source:

> A more meaningful way to think about the carbon footprint of your own electricity use is to think of it as being additional to all the power consumption that was already going on before you flicked on the light or appliance. Looked at this way, the extra demand that you place on the grid is met entirely through additional fossil fuels, because the renewables in your country will already be running at full capacity. In other words, when you turn the lights on, you don't personally affect the amount generated by renewables because they are already going flat out. Rather, what you trigger is almost certain to be a lump of coal thrown into a power station. This is the case through Europe, because even in countries where all electricity comes from renewables or nuclear, adding to demand reduces the amount of electricity that those countries are able to export, thereby increasing the fossil-fuel generation in other nations. Looked at in this sense - in therms of 'marginal demand' - each unit of electricity you consume has a footprint of at least 1 kg CO2e per unit, regardless of which country you live in.

This goes against the way that people usually talk about marginal energy footprint and I'm having some trouble wrapping my head around it (never mind convincing other people). Can you recommend some additional reading or ELI5 it for me?","2015-08-11 23:23:13","3","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3gnmjs/the_marginal_footprint_of_energy_consumption/","True","HotterRod","1747902129.510247","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
