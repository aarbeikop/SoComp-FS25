Researchers have said that humankind did not evolve quickly enough cognitively and emotionally from the hunter-gatherer days to be able to comprehend modern science,

Libertarians don't believe that the government should be involved in our daily lives so subconsciously the more that libertarians learn about climate science the more they reject it. Fossil fuel companies spread a lot of misinformation and once people develop an opinion it is very hard for them to change it. People that have vested interests in fossil fuel profits, people that like to believe they are the true ""skeptics"", people that are scared by the news and people that don't want things to change can all very easily just deny that huge change is underfoot. People that have groups of denier friends may choose to side with their tribal affiliations rather than stir the pot and become an outcast. People don't want to hear bad news, especially the ""positive police"" types.

Baby boomers don't care because they think they will dead before climate change wreaks havoc and because they don't care they won't look at the science and realize that they will witness the changes.

Don't feel bad though as I've tried to raise the issue with many people over the years and had little success. Many states and countries are declaring that there is a ""climate crisis"" and I only personally know two people that have a good understanding of climate change.

We're currently at a point where we can't meaningfully stop a bad outcome. Even if we started doing literally everything right starting now, parts of our planet that currently have people living on them will no longer be able to support permanent human settlements. This could be due to flooding, long-lasting forest fires, droughts, extreme temperatures, etc. That outcome is close to unavoidable and I'd be very skeptical of people saying otherwise.

What we should focus our collective efforts on are two things. First, we must ensure that we don't go towards a worse outcome. The other thing is making sure we are prepared for the bad things that are almost certainly going to happen;

Unfortunately, neither of those things is happening on the scale it needs to be happening. I won't go too in-depth on it and assume most people here are aware that this is the case.

The good news, however, is that we don't actually need new technologies to make an impact. Currently, trees are still the best ""technology"" we have for getting carbon out of the atmosphere and we know how to deal with trees. The other actions can be summarized as a wide-scale global restructuring of the way our society works. 

Some of that could be easy, some of that could require certain people or groups to make sacrifices, some of that could make your life better. There is a **ton** that can be done here and not one single policy is going to save us. We need multiple and comprehensive restructuring. 

That is action that needs to be done on a global level. The only thing you can do as an individual to make that happen is by lending your voice, energy, and/or time to people moving towards that world. This could be politicians, but it could also be groups that don't want (or can't) deal with electoral politics. It's unlikely that we will see the required changes in the required timeframe without massively pressuring those in power.

The actions you can take on an individual level don't have as much of an impact but can still be valuable. Not relying on animal sources for food, avoiding driving a car, not taking the plane... are all things you can do.","2019-07-30 13:41:55","2","[deleted]","1747944141.109065","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

"evka6vk","t3_ck46c6","ck46c6","collapse","skeptical","""Society""? What ""society"" encourages or frowns upon - is of little consequence. Societies do not make laws and regulations, nor enforce them, directly by themselves. 

So if you're asking if governments should encourage or simply tolerate suicidal behaviours, - then the answer is, they can't. Every person gone - is 1 tax payer less. They won't cut the branch on which they themselves sit - which is, the population of their countries.

More importantly, however, is that suicide is not doing good for the future. If you want to do some good, you gotta leave a mark. Change something and/or someones for the better. You can't do that with a suicide. As for your personal carbon footprint, - removing it from the pictuire could possibly matter a tiny bit about ~50 years ago or earlier, but nowadays we're already locked in for HotHouse Earth anyhow. At best, your suicide would delay things to come by something like few minutes. Not prevent anything. This is how much i can tell from all the science i learned through the years. 

That said, for sure, i agree that one's life is one's own. If someone seriously, calmly and continuosly feel he must perform suicide - i believe no force on Earth will be able to stop them. One does not need no ""encouragement"" nor ""permission by law"" to do it, anyway. 

Even if it'd be a crime, - noone's able to ""punish"" it for the obvious reason: the criminal is dead, i.e. does not physically exist as a person anymore. However, always remember: anyhow assisting any other person to do suicide - is often seen as a crime and in many jurisdictions is indeed punishable by law, as in this case the criminal is still alive - and can well be punished for doing things which helped to ""remove a tax payer"" from the population over which a government exist.

The latter is why you should never, in particular, use the word ""encourage"" if you speak about suicides. Might get you fined or, even, jailed.

Other ways to influence the corporations is to target their insurance carriers.

Interesting, so let me get this straight, the countries most pressured by this approach would be countries which have historically suffered worst from colonialism. Therefore the developed world asks the world community to accept their emissions during industrialization from 1800s to today, yet denies the same industrialization to third world countries by imposing carbon caps. I'm sure this will go over smoothly.

&#x200B;

Not to mention that most of the third world countries emissions today are simply exported first world emissions. Most of the emissions emitted by China is due to making products for export to the first world.
