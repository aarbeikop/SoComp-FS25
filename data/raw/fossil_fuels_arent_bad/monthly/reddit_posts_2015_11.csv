"3tfhjb","environment","emotional","Any sympathy for the US COP negotiators?","Wouldn't it be embarrassing to represent a country who is at the top of the historical/per capita/consumption emissions spectrum? 

Consider that if the remaining emissions to keep the world under 2C were divided equally on a per capita basis, the US would use up it's share of emissions before a Paris agreement would even go into effect (in 2020). Who wants to represent a country like that?

What do you suppose they say in the meetings? Perhaps: Because we have always used more fossil fuels than anyone else and because we continue to use more fossil fuels than anyone else, that means we have the right to use more fossil fuels than anyone else going forward.

How greedy and stupid are the American people? Even Bernie Sanders has started parroting Obama saying we should ""lead"" on climate change. What nonsense. That's like saying we should lead on universal health coverage. I know Bernie is in a tough position having to appeal to the American ego, and he's already saying we should emulate social democracies in other ways, but it's still dishonest to say that America could ""lead"" on climate change now that we're 25 years behind some other countries.

The only proof you should need that the US will never be a leader in emissions reduction but rather a late comer that has to be dragged along is that they use 2005 as a baseline level of emissions rather than the 1990 base set up by the Kyoto accords.

Despite all of Obama's recent posing as an environmentalist, he has not uttered one word truly consistent with an under 2C rise in temperature. It seems to me that Obama's job is to placate the increasing number of voters who have been educated on and care about this issue. Just do the bare minimum. For example, why in hell should it take 7 years and untold person-hours of activism just to stop KXL (meanwhile alternatives have been built in the interim)? 

Personally I do not feel bad for the US negotiators because really there is no attempt to be honest or humble. In fact, since Obama hijacked and destroyed the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, it's clear that they are controlling the process rather than participating as an equal partner.
