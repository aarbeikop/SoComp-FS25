"f76qh4b","t3_dudspm","dudspm","collapse","skeptical","""Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people. Suppose for example that some “green” party should win control of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigrous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average man the results would appear disastrous: There would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the “green” party would be voted out o,f offfice and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. For this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above.""

Edit - I do take issue with the following statement though

""Substituting Grass for Food Might “Work,” but It Would Require Whole New Systems 

If we consider other species, we find that animals with four stomachs can, in fact, live quite well on a diet of grass. These animals often have teeth that grow continuously because the silica in grass tends to wear down their teeth. If we could just get around these little details, we might be able to make the change.""

I didn't know that cows, cats, dogs, deer to name a few continually regrow teeth. News to me.

Edit - fuck you and your shitty links.  Animals that eat grass regrow teeth.  What the fuck are you smoking?!?","2019-11-11 04:41:42","2","[deleted]","1747946083.517941","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

If you've not already seen it, Chris Clugston's new book, ""[Blip: Humanity's 300 Year Self-Terminating Experiment with Industrialism](https://booklocker.com/books/10605.html)"" is right along these lines.
