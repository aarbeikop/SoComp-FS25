I'm intrigued by this sentence.  Carbon Dioxide is the main concern with greenhouse gases.  But even without CO2, fossil fuels are still directly impacting the environment as they are typically mined.  How do you separate impacts to climate or environment when they are both almost directly related to one another?

&#x200B;

The reason to act now and act fast now is that there is a lot of ""excess"" CO2 already in the atmosphere/ocean from our activities over the last century.  Numerical models based on our understanding of how the ecosystem works, suggests that this will already cause the global temperature to steadily rise.   This is already starting to happen and is  then unlocking methane and more harmful gases from areas that were previously permanently frozen.

&#x200B;

We can attribute the change in greenhouse gases, temperature and weather extremes by running simulations of the atmosphere (out to 100s of years from now and before now) under different circumstances.  We can tell the simulation to have a certain amount of CO2 and then compare that outcome with simulations that have less/ more and start to work out why there are differences.

There are three big cells of overturning air between the equator and the pole: [Hadley Cell, Mid-Latitude Cell, and Polar Cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation#/media/File:Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg).  As you warm the planet, the north pole warms more than the equator, reducing the magnitude of the equator-to-pole temperature gradient.  We would expect this to shift the northern boundary of the Hadley Cell northward, expanding the subtropical dry zone.  This would cause places which were north of this climate boundary to become drier, and experience more frequent drought by the standard of how it was before.   This is [actually observed](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL072353).

I'm going to strongly recommend that you read [this](http://library.open.oregonstate.edu/climatechange/chapter/processes/) which has a pretty good introductory-level overview of how heat and moisture transport work, and provides far more detail than I realistically can in a reddit comment.","2019-03-17 13:05:33","1","silence7","1747942414.433173","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"eiqx3eh","t3_b23mev","b23mev","climate","scientific",">Why don't we invest in nuclear energy, which is now cleaner and cheaper (modern nuclear reactors produce way less nuclear waste, are much more efficient, and aren't liable for nuclear meltdowns).

This the high-tech sector, and requires some of the most highly skilled labourers an economy has.

Security concerns are also detrimental to economic simplicity, requiring an entire mini-society.

Meaning specialised fire departments, police, inspectors, regulation and management.

>Why electric cars instead of hydrogen cars? Electricity is the hardest energy form to generate, batteries have a short lifespan, don't charge very quickly (even 15 minutes is way too long to wait for charging your car), and have a very short action radius. While hydrogen cars are much more flexible in their fuel source. it can be generated from methane with carbon dioxide capturing (co2 is used in greenhouses to improve efficiency) and it can be generated efficiently (however not economically viable yet) from nuclear power plants using Sulphur and iodine. Hydrogen are improving fast in efficiency (60% to 85%), while electric cars are 99% efficient, but at the source of electricity it isn't very efficient to generate.

The best option:

>In 1919, Ford told The Christian Science Monitor (according to this New York Times account): “The fuel of the future is going to come from fruit like that sumach \[a flowering plant\] out by the road, or from apples, weeds, sawdust — almost anything.”

>Ford’s Model T, introduced in 1908, could run just as well on alcohol fuels as on traditional gasoline. The driver could easily switch from one fuel to the other simply by turning a brass knob to the right of the steering column. This turned a screw in the carburetor, allowing either more or less fuel to enter the engine and mix with air. Alcohol fuel doesn’t contain as much energy as gasoline, so more of it needs to be injected to run the engine as well.

>Rudolf Diesel was the father of the engine which bears his name. His first attempts were to design an engine to run on coal dust, but later designed his engine to run on vegetable oil. The idea, he hoped, would make his engines more attractive to farmers having a source of fuel readily available. In a 1912 presentation to the British Institute of Mechanical Engineers, he cited a number of efforts in this area and remarked, ""The fact that fat oils from vegetable sources can be used may seem insignificant today, but such oils may perhaps become in course of time of the same importance as some natural mineral oils and the tar products are now.""

Climate is a multidimensional chaotic complex system responding to a strange attractor. You can stress the system by altering heat retention by emitting GHGs to the atmosphere and you will get small changes which look like the former weather but at some indeterminate point the chaotic system will revert to a new strange attractor and you will have an entirely new climate system. At that point all Hell breaks loose. ","2019-03-18 01:52:06","1","ecocommish","1747942414.440011","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
