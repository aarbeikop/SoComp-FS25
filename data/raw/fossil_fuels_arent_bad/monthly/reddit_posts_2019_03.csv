"b23mev","climate","scientific","How do we know that the increase of temperature is the cause of droughts and more storms.","Hi, I'm certainly not a climate change denier of some sort, but I want to know the truth and separate facts from hysteria. I first want to mention that I'm really annoyed when climate and environment are mixed up. Climate is avout the average weather and environment about the ecosystem we live in. If I'm burning fossil fuels it warms the climate, while not impactong the environment directly. (If no harmful gasses like carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxide is emitted)

My question is: If everyone follows the Paris agreement and all carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to 95% of what is was in 1990, will there still be lots of problems. Or better said, why is it cheaper to reduce carbon dioxide emissions right now than lets say over a century. Solar and wind panels are very expensive and need batteries to replace fossil power plants. 

Why don't we invest in nuclear energy, which is now cleaner and cheaper (modern nuclear reactors produce way less nuclear waste, are much more efficient, and aren't liable for nuclear meltdowns). 

Why electric cars instead of hydrogen cars? Electricity is the hardest energy form to generate, batteries have a short lifespan, don't charge very quickly (even 15 minutes is way too long to wait for charging your car), and have a very short action radius. While hydrogen cars are much more flexible in their fuel source. it can be generated from methane with carbon dioxide capturing (co2 is used in greenhouses to improve efficiency) and it can be generated efficiently (however not economically viable yet) from nuclear power plants using Sulphur and iodine. Hydrogen are improving fast in efficiency (60% to 85%), while electric cars are 99% efficient, but at the source of electricity it isn't very efficient to generate. 

Why solar and wind. Why so much money in the wrong things. If it is so expensive, isn't it cheaper to deal with  later. 


I like to debate on this topic. Go ask away.

"awt8lh","environment","emotional","What are the opinions on Patrick Moore?","This guy is often seen as being the founder, or at least one of them, of Greenpeace. I was then of course very surprised to find out that recently he did a big turn-around, and is now making videos for PragerU (A NeoCon propaganda think tank that literally promotes Climate Change denial, fossil fuels and heavy industry), and also worked with Stephen Crower in a video where he called climate change a ""scam"". 

&#x200B;

Patrick Moore left Greenpeace and went to work for some very anti-Environmenal people e.g. Crowder and PragerU. In response to Cortez's so called 'Green Deal' he said that banning fossil fuels would basically destroy all of Earth's trees as the need for fuel would create an insurmountable demand for logs to burn. 

&#x200B;

(1) - Do you guys think that he shilled for some anti-Eco activists?

(2) - Do you think that the guy has lost his mind?

I'm not really sure what's happening but it's sure weird to see the Greenpeace founder cosying up to Climate Change deniers and Industrialists.
