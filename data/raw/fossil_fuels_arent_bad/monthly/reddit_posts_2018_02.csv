"7y91ot","collapse","skeptical","Cancer apes require renewables and nuclear energy to survive - but apes love FIRE.","The only way to provide power to all 7.6 billion cancer apes and reduce carbon emissions to zero is renewable energy + nuclear energy.  Yes, nuclear energy is not zero emissions, but the cancer apes have 400+ nuclear reactors that can easily be upgraded to eliminate safety concerns. (. http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/nuclear-power-in-the-world-today.aspx ).  Once the power plant is online, carbon emissions are next to nothing.  Nuclear waste is an issue, but CO2 emissions are an even bigger issue - cancer apes can solve nuclear waste (at least for now), they cannot solve CO2.  Close to 20 or 30 Nuclear power plants exist, and are in the process of being decommissioned because the cancer apes are scared of things they can't see.  These just need to be turned back online and repaired/upgraded - screw the unnecessary rules and regulations, just stop emitting carbon - turn all reactors online immediately and shut down all natural gas and coal plants.  

Every country needs to start tripling their nuclear fleets, get to at least 50% nuclear power by 2030, and 25% renewables and 25% fossil fuels.  Saudi Arabia has committed to building 16 nuclear power plants by 2030, if a shitty little country like SA can build 16 nuclear power plants in 10 years, then the united states and china could easily build 200 in the same time frame.

Renewables are self explanatory, wind, solar, and geothermal energy will never be able to provide baseload power of nuclear energy, but with a massive nuclear fleet, wind and solar will do the rest.  10 years is plenty to reallocate all resources to going to zero carbon emissions, but there's no motivation - the apes are having too much fun.

**Unfortunately, this plan, or even a plan that moderately resembles this plan, will never happen.**

So the cancer apes will party like its 1999 until they can't grow their winter wheat because it's 50-60 degrees for 3 weeks in March (or February.  https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/USDC0001:1:US ) followed by an ""arctic vortex"" in early April (or March) that kills everything.   Virtually all the grains on Earth are produced in the northern hemisphere, and the arctic is now 5-7 degrees Celsius above the 1980 average. ( http://cci-reanalyzer.org/wx/DailySummary/#t2anom ), and no cancer apes even know how much warmer the Arctic is right now compared to pre-industrial civilization.  If it's not the arctic vortex that prevents the apes from growing grains, it's going to be the droughts that are already forming:  http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu

As a result, within a short period of time most of the cancer apes will be rotting corpses.  Turns out it's just damn hard to grow crops when you have unpredictable weather patterns and screwed up freeze thaw cycles.  Turns out that if you can't grow crops, the animals you require to survive like cows, and chickens have a hard time staying alive themselves.  The cancer apes were having too much fun bother themselves with protecting their environment.  They preferred relatively unattractive pieces of green paper over concerns of their sustainability.

The cancer ape's Eulogy is going to go something like this:

Cancer apes are scared of advanced technology they can't understand like nuclear energy and renewables, so they choose to stick with FIRE - fire is GOOD for cancer apes, GOOD FIRE BURN BURN BURN - FIRE makes the computers go ZOOM, FIRE makes airplanes and most importantly- FIRE makes economy, FIRE MAKES PROFIT!
