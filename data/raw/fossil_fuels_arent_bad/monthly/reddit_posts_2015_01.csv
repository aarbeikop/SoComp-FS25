Assuming for the moment that everything the AGW folks claim is true and we do indeed decide as a society to DO something about it--what do we do? What SPECIFICALLY do we do to transition away from fossil fuels (generically) and into other methods of production and such?

Looking for SPECIFIC examples here, if possible....

EDIT: My bad, I wasn't very clear in looking for *world* solutions more than *individual* solutions.  There have been many ideas tossed out there from taxing the snot out of fossil fuels to (yes, this was offered by one Redditor at one point) actually **killing** people who drove cars.  While the individual stuff is useful I'm much more curious about the more global solutions please.","2015-01-16 15:51:42","0","21","0.3","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/2smy6z/so_what_specifically_do_we_do_about_agw/","True","TheFerretman","1747892844.748418","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
