"39yuyn","climate","scientific","Let's do Paris before the COPS arrive","I propose that we crowd source a climate change agreement on reddit rather than leaving it to a bunch of stodgy old bureaucrats later this year. Anything and everything should be on the table to start. I'll propose some categories and make a proposal to get the ball rolling.

**Types of Emissions:** There are several kinds of emissions: Historical, future, per capita, and consumption versus production to name a few. I won't insult readers of r/climate by defining them here but at some point precise definitions might become necessary. For example consumption emissions might be defined as:

total emissions - exported emissions + imported emissions

It's also possible to combine categories, for example per capita historical emissions could conceivably be important to somebody.

**Budget:** I assume (and I won't say this again but nothing I say here is meant to be etched in stone) each country will be left with a future carbon budget after the negotiations are complete. The first order of business would seem to be an overall budget, which can then be divvied up between countries. Does anyone still think a 2C target is reachable based on IPCC numbers? 

The 1000 gigatons (Gt) of total carbon emissions number gets thrown out a lot as giving us some chance of a 2C target maximum temperature rise. That may not include carbon equivalents for stuff like NO2 and multipliers on methane and CFCs, but it's a round number, which is nice. We might have to agree to some reforestation or afforestation if we start with that number. 

We've already emitted about 550 Gt so we're left with about 450 Gt under that scenario. That also equates to about 1650 CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). Take away the 150 Gt CO2e due to be released as methane and we're once again left with a round 1500 Gt CO2 equivalents.

[Others might argue that's too generous by half](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/10/carbon-briefing-making-sense-of-the-ipcc%E2%80%99s-new-carbon-budget/), and I look forward to input on the matter. In my opinion choosing numbers that are unrealistically low does not serve us well in the long run.

**Other types of mitigation:** I mentioned growing trees. Is it wise to include some expectation of CCS by other means? It seems like we might get there for point-of-release emissions although on what scale I do not know and am dubious.

**Accountability:** One of the shameful legacies of the Copenhagen accords brought about by a few bad actors was the idea that compliance should be voluntary. It seems to me that we're going to have to have some sort of international monitoring and even fines, perhaps to be paid into:

**International Green Climate Fund:** Or whatever it's called to help developing countries develop renewable energy (and nuclear?). I think the amount paid into this fund should be heavily related to historical emissions. This could also be funded by a worldwide carbon tax, which would put the onus on future emitters. Perhaps a combination?

**My proposal:** In terms of future carbon budgets, how about if we neglect historical emissions and even consumption emissions and just base each country's budget on equal per capita emissions? 

Going forward, every man, woman, and child is allowed the same amount of emissions.

At first blush this may seem like a raw deal for developing countries that are not responsible for historical emissions. However, when you start looking at the numbers it seems like the best they can hope for. According to the numbers above and my error-prone calculations, that's about 200 tons of CO2e emissions per person from now until eternity. Countries can decide for themselves how that's spread between individuals and future generations as seems inevitable regardless of how the budgets are allocated.

[You can get a rough idea of how long a budget would last in a given country by dividing 200 by these numbers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita) 

Obviously it's going to be most difficult for countries with the highest per capita emissions such as Australia, The USA, and Canada. It's about 8 years of emissions for these countries at current rates, more if they start cutting back. Under a cap and trade system they could conceivably buy carbon credits from developing countries or perhaps build solar installations in these countries in exchange for carbon credits.

China would have about 30 years of emissions at current rates, but given current trends would have to peak or at least seriously level off before their announced 2030 target. European countries, Japan and others would fall in between these two. 

At current rates, third world countries would have until the end of the century and beyond to give up fossil fuels but would also have plenty of room to increase consumption in the short term and then transition to renewables.","2015-06-15 22:17:25","1","0","0.54","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/39yuyn/lets_do_paris_before_the_cops_arrive/","True","knowyourbrain","1747897979.8962271","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"
"38t9i2","environment","emotional","Discussion outside the mainscream media","(Hello Group, my name is David, and I just got here. This will be my second post, the first was already removed)

I just browsed the threads here, and, there are several articles linked to the New York Times and other REALLY BIG syndicated media sources. 

What a waste of space. 

Does anyone here actually believe that the MSM is going to help us all be rid of fossil fuels?

Really?

All while today we (Humans) burned more fossil fuels than yesterday, and tomorrow we will burn more than today. Not only is that statement true, it has been true, daily, for many decades now.

What ""we"" need, are solutions to this problem. It is a problem, for, in my little pristine part of the world, a small town in Ontario, Canada, most of the insects today are gone, as are most of the birds. And, this is true everywhere on Earth today. 

How can so much discussion on a topic occur while persistently avoiding discussion on alternatives?

And even so, any discussion on alternatives to fossil fuels (like electric cars, for example) has already been discussed to death by the mainscream media, and their only role in all of those words was to muddy the waters, to get people biased towards all things electric, and bend your perception to them to the point where you actually believe that electric cars are more trouble than worth.  

In any event, if we continue to repeat their words, glorify and praise them, the status quo will remain intact and unchanged. 

I personally find the relentless dribble offered by the MSM to be offensive, off topic, and completely irrelevant. 

If, for example, on todays date, one believes that ""people need to be informed"" on environmental issues, then you've already lost. 

We already know that things are bad. 

What is needed, what has always been needed right from the beginning, were alternatives. We need to leave the remaining fossil fuels in the ground. Period. 

We do not need to ""educate people"" for, if there actually are any people who don't see this as of yet: they are either playing dumb, or, have just arrived here from, oh I don't know, another planet?

And in any event, solutions will not come from the mainscream media. The only things they have ever said about the alternatives were to cast darkness and negativity onto these alternatives, and that will always and only ever be their option on this. 

Furthermore, these lies have been going on for soooo long now, that we barely, if at all, have time remaining to repair the damage to the biosphere. Fossil fuels, another example of these disinformation agents, do NOT utilize power from the sun via plant matter in the ground. There actually is no inherent power in fossil fuels, for, a gasoline motor on the Moon will not function. 

The power they need is the very same power that powers you, me, and everything else inside The Animal Kingdom. It is what The Plant Kingdom did for billions of years prior to the arrival of any inside what is now The Animal Kingdom: oxygenated the atmosphere. It is O2 that powers these devices, and because of which the sky IS falling today. At least the O2 level of the sky is falling, and in what is going to seem like a very short time frame today, whatever remains of The Animal Kingdom will follow all of those species that have departed beginning around the year 2000. We have, visibly, and in the historical record, watched species after species drop dead, and in the case of birds, they have been dropping dead right out of the sky. Not only the Bees, all insect populations have succumbed to Hypoxia, and fish, in the billions world wide, continue to go belly up. 

I am in the scientific community, and of this I will tell you that because of the mainscream media and all of their agents of disinformation, we have to fight you, to save you. 

They have created a veritable army of people who will argue until they are blue in the face that electric cars cost more, use more resources, and won't thwart greenhouse gas production. 

I wish that was a joke, but it is not. 

Anyway, maybe I'm glad to be here, and maybe I'm not. I don't know yet, however, with so much credence given to the MSM in this very thread, I'm not holding my breath. 

I do know that there ARE real people with real concern over what is the most important discussion that NEVER OCCURRED, and perhaps some are here. 

I would like nothing more than to restore the balance in the biosphere, but like I said earlier, because you have been lied to sooooo much, we have to now fight many of you to save any of you.
