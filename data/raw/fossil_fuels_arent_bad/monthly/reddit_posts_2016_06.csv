"4n711w","collapse","skeptical","A Civilization Based on Pure Nihilism",">Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy. While few philosophers would claim to be nihilists, nihilism is most often associated with Friedrich Nietzsche who argued that its corrosive effects would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate the greatest crisis in human history.

>Existential nihilism is the notion that life has no intrinsic meaning or value, and it is, no doubt, the most commonly used and understood sense of the word today.

Well, that sums up where we have arrived. **Life**, in its complete form as the Biosphere, a thin living skin that envelops this small planet, is to us now devoid of any ‘intrinsic meaning or value’. As an integral part of that Biosphere, our species, and that includes you, are likewise stripped of any meaning. Without meaning, what right will you be given to exist?

For some reason, this made me recall on old advertising slogan for Schlitz Beer: ‘You only go around once in life: Go for all the gusto you can.’ Researching that found Schlitz is now defunct as an independent brand, and that the ‘Gusto’ ad campaign coincided with a decision to cut its costs of production. The resulting, reformulated beverage was
>…a beer that not only lost much of the flavor and consistency of the traditional formula but spoiled more quickly, rapidly losing public appeal. [From Wiki]


‘You only go around once in life: Go for all the gusto you can’ could now be the official slogan for our Civilization, which is descending into pure nihilism. Friedrich Nietzsche might be the ultimate prophet. It may have drove him insane, too.

Of course, not everyone has yet embraced pure nihilism. ‘What about future generations?’ some thoughtful ones will object, thinking of their descendants. ‘What will posterity ever do for us?’ an asshole replies. ‘History will judge you,’ the thoughtful then warn. That admonition is now just bullshit, of course. Let us now go to another mad prophet, one who might have enjoyed a cold can of good old Schlitz.

This is from an interview with Charles Manson, the American cult leader now serving life for mass murder in a California penitentiary. (I first saw this here on r/Collapse, almost a year ago, but I had to find a fresh link to it. Still, I apologize for not taking the time to give attribution to the OP.)

>How would you like to be remembered once you pass away, as you’re a famous person?

>“I don’t even know what that means, ‘remember’.
 
>How would you like to be reminded by people when you pass away?

>There’s gonna be no people. You can’t seem to understand. Let me explain to you: your air is dying. Automobiles and fossil fuels are destroying your atmosphere. You cannot face that. If you cannot face that, and stop that fossil fuel, and stop all them automobiles, trucks, cars, and buses and planes, there’s gonna be no air to breathe. You’re not gonna have any brain to remember anything. You’re not gonna be there at all. Do you understand that?

>Full transcription of interview between David Lopez and Charles Manson

Since the age of 13, Mr. Manson has spent almost the entirety of his life in the custody of the state, usually for violent crimes, yet he somehow became keenly concerned with the human destruction of the Biosphere. This is from an interview conducted in 1969, after his arrest for his cult mass murders.

>CHARLES MANSON: When you look at things in a positive manner, everything can work out perfect. You know, like as fast as man can go, he is destroying everything he can destroy. The pace that he’s picked up in sawing the trees down, killing the animals and shooting everything. You know, I go live out in the desert and I see a lot of madness. I see big fat people coming around with guns, shooting lizards, spiders, birds, anything they can get their hands on. Just killing and killing. They’re all programmed to kill.

>Tuesday’s Child Interview

http://www.mansondirect.com/tuesdayschild.html

While trying and convicting Charles Manson for the ‘Helter Skelter’ murders, the prosecution asserted his motive was the delusion that these killings would start an apocalyptic race war, one that would lead to the Collapse of Global Civilization.

If the human future no longer exists, then we are free of it. What is our relation to the past? The NYT runs a weekly ‘philosophy column’ and I read one that asserted that every past event has influenced your current existence, much like the proverbial flap of a butterfly’s wings gives rise to hurricanes. Therefore, you might be *grateful for it all of the past, even the worst events of human history*. In my case, I have a paternal great-great-grandmother, Big Ma Box, whom family legend has variously described as being of either Choctaw or African-American descent. (I saw a 19th Century tintype of her once, and judged she might have been either or both.) By this philosophy, I should be grateful for either the genocide committed against the Choctaws (see Trail of Tears) or the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, and ultimately, all of you should be as well. Philosophy makes my head hurt.

Now consider the obverse of that argument. If all of the past, *even the noblest efforts of human history and endeavor* have led inexorably to another Mass Extinction, should we now reject them? In his novel *No Country for Old Men*, Cormac McCarthy placed this wisdom into the mouth of his fictional psychopathic killer, Antoine Chigurh:

> If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?

Chigurh asked this of his hapless competitor, Carson Wells, and then

> He [Wells] closed his eyes and he turned his head and he raised one hand to fend away what could not be fended away. Chigurh shot him in the face. Everything that Wells had ever known or thought or loved drained slowly down the wall behind him. His mother's face, his First Communion, women he had known. The faces of men as they died on their knees before him. The body of a child dead in a roadside ravine in another country.

By the way, the planet would keep on turning without him.

So do we not owe some obligation to our honorable ancestors, to cemeteries filled with hallowed patriots, to the treasures bequeathed on us from countless generations past? To ancient Mesopotamia or medieval China, to the Bible or the Koran or the Enlightenment – should we be grateful to what ‘brought us to this’? No, approaching our Extinction liberates us from any sentimental restraints.

If we are now free of the both past and future, what is our relation to the Unseen, to the Supernatural, to any Deity? ‘God will get you for this’ they have warned me. Perhaps you are an atheist. There must be philosophical consequences to being an atheist.

>Dostoevsky once wrote: “If God did not exist, everything would be permitted”; and that, for existentialism, is the starting point. Everything is indeed permitted if God does not exist, and man is in consequence forlorn, for he cannot find anything to depend upon either within or outside himself. He discovers forthwith, that he is without excuse. For if indeed existence precedes essence, one will never be able to explain one’s action by reference to a given and specific human nature; in other words, there is no determinism – man is free, man is freedom. Nor, on the other hand, if God does not exist, are we provided with any values or commands that could legitimise our behaviour. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. – We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does.

I do not agree with or even comprehend that in full, but it seems to me, that when left to their own devices, ‘free people’ are making some very bad choices, and the greater tragedy comes because nothing holds them responsible for them. Here is a much simpler expression of what Sartre was saying about our current alienation from all meaning.

> Riders on the storm, riders on the storm

> Into this house we're born, into this world we're thrown

>Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan

>Riders on the storm

The guy who wrote that lyric died from his own bad choices at the age of twenty-seven. Our collective bad choices will now bring the death of much more than ourselves.

I am an agnostic, which is to say, I hold no belief in any existing religion but remain open to do so. All of previous human societies had at their founding, a myth. Our corrosive reasoning has destroyed those myths and has left us without meaning. If we, and most of our sibling species, are to ‘Thread the Bottleneck’ (as E. O. Wilson puts it) of this Civilization of Pure Nihilism, we need a new myth. To believe in nothing is our certain doom. This might be a good place to begin to find belief.

> The biophilia hypothesis suggests that there is an instinctive bond between human beings and other living systems. Edward O. Wilson introduced and popularized the hypothesis in his book, Biophilia (1984).He defines biophilia as ""the urge to affiliate with other forms of life"". [From Wiki.]

The closest thing I have to an immortal soul is the genome coiled inside each of my cells. That emerged billions of years ago, and I share it with all known Life. For as long as the human species persists, so will I in that sense, and if it should endure another hundred thousand years, scaled against my brief life, that is as good as Eternity. That is as near to an afterlife and a meaning for my existence that I have found. It is spiritual enough to become a religion. It is a salvation myth, because it justifies a Holy War to preserve this Earthly Paradise.
