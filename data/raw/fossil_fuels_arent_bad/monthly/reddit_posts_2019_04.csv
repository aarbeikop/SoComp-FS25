"b82kzg","collapse","skeptical","How many years of fossil fuel usage do we have left?","I think this will be what it boils down to in the coming years. The basic story right now is:

&nbsp;

We were able to advance this far and this quickly due to a source of energy that was amazingly efficient. But it turns out, this stuff is a natural part of the Earth that hurts the planet for us to extract and consume. We need to move on to a healthier source of energy that won’t allow for drastic effects to our planet. The main problems right now are that
 
&nbsp;

1) The managers of the processes of procuring this natural resource are rich beyond measure, to the point that they shape government agendas. Every country that is developed/developing is helplessly in need of this resource, making this an endless habit of throwing money at oil companies to maintain/improve the modern lifestyle. 

&nbsp;

2.) We don’t have the best options for an alternative source of energy that is just as efficient if not more. Solar energy hasn’t quite had the breakthrough yet in sufficient power sourcing. Nuclear energy has a stigma against it at the moment due to a few bad accidents in foreign countries. While nuclear energy will eventually come if things get bad enough, the current consensus doesn’t seem to consider it seriously enough. Other sources of energy are killing the Earth. 

&nbsp;

3.) The countries that control this resource on the global market are the wealthiest and most powerful in current times. They also happen to be at odds with one another on various issues and maintain conflicting agendas. 

&nbsp;

This conflict of interest between who controls the resources/power and who consume all the energy is really holding human society from making our next great worldwide industrial/energy revolution.

&nbsp;

The optimist in me is hoping that we’ll be able to figure it out, together. Realize that we live here on this rock together, we gotta take care of it, and come together as human beings a bit. 

&nbsp;

The realist in me thinks maybe most of us and the mainstream population don’t care enough right now. We’ve been living in ridiculously amazing times (especially if you’re in the developed world’s middle class and above), considering the grand scheme of the human timeline. We don’t know famine, we don’t know the ancient ways we used to live. Unfortunately this tendency will probably be the greatest cause of our procrastination in this matter as a species. We don’t care enough right now and won’t until things actually get bad. 

&nbsp;

So how many years of fossil fuel usage do we have left? I’d also like the factor in the price gauging towards the last rounds of batches in the global supply. When will it start affecting the daily consumers of oil and developed modern life systems?
