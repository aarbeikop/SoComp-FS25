I don't think they'll ever hold that final conclusion.

So they'll always find some optimistic spin, even while they show numbers that ought to scare anyone.

**Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf** 

> Abstract
> 
> This paper summarizes current understanding of the processes that determine the dynamics of the subsea permafrost–hydrate system existing in the largest, shallowest shelf in the Arctic Ocean; the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). We review key environmental factors and mechanisms that determine formation, current dynamics, and thermal state of subsea permafrost, mechanisms of its destabilization, and rates of its thawing; a full section of this paper is devoted to this topic. Another important question regards the possible existence of permafrost-related hydrates at shallow ground depth and in the shallow shelf environment. We review the history of and earlier insights about the topic followed by an extensive review of experimental work to establish the physics of shallow Arctic hydrates. We also provide a principal (simplified) scheme explaining the normal and altered dynamics of the permafrost–hydrate system as glacial–interglacial climate epochs alternate. We also review specific features of methane releases determined by the current state of the subsea-permafrost system and possible future dynamics. This review presents methane results obtained in the ESAS during two periods: 1994–2000 and 2003–2017. A final section is devoted to discussing future work that is required to achieve an improved understanding of the subject.

**Dissecting Paleoclimate Change**

*Using a core sample from the Santa Barbara Basin, UCSB researchers decipher the history of paleoclimate change with surprising results*

> “One of the most astonishing things about our results is the abruptness of the warming in sea surface temperatures,” explained co-author Kennett, a professor emeritus in UCSB’s Department of Earth Science. “Of the 13 degree Fahrenheit total change, a shift of 7 to 9 degrees occurred almost immediately right at the beginning.”
> 
> Kennett noted that this remarkable record of paleoclimate changes also raises an important question: What process can possibly push the Earth’s climate so fast from a glacial to an interglacial state? The researchers may have discovered the answer based on the core’s geochemical record: The warming associated with the major climatic shift was accompanied by simultaneous releases of methane — a potent greenhouse gas.
> 
> “This particular episode of climate change is closely associated with instability that caused the release of methane from gas hydrates at the ocean floor,” Kennett said. “These frozen forms of methane melt when temperatures rise or pressure decreases. Changes in sea level affect the stability of gas hydrates and water temperature even more so.

"ewttdzr","t3_cq0xb7","cq0xb7","collapse","skeptical","Woah. For someone ""just asking questions"" you got a hella lot of research done!

No. AFAIK there are no studies that ""determine at what point does Human Civilization collapses and Humans go extinct""

There are way too many variables. It would be like guessing when the next stock market collapse will happen or when to sell bitcoin (except even more complicated, as you probably know because you just listed a big chunk of the variables and all of them are pretty much unknown).

You need to take that bunch of information and group it in to ""maybe this happens next"". Cloud loss for example isn't the next worry. A shit load too many clouds is the worry before we reach that point. By the time the clouds boil off we'll pretty much all be dead anyway. (YAY!)

Heh. Your post is a first. I sort of want to say ""No it's not as bad as that!"" but it is .. except the sequence of events is ill defined and will probably take longer than you seem to think. We will get there. It will be hell on the way. But it's one step at a time. And it probably only takes fairly minor climate problems to kick us towards collapse. You don't need everything to kick in and doom us to dust before society as we know it grinds to a halt.

Activists are largely mis-lead. Sorry. My view. Some may down vote for that. But virtually all the ""green activist"" solutions you see out there are designed around making already rich corporations richer at the expense of poor people. If you look at who actually profits from the accepted main stream narratives on what we should be doing, it's probably someone like the Koch Brothers (yes someone makes money from solar panels, EV's and windfarms, and it's not that ecologically sound at the moment to be making them .. it could be .. if the entire process chain was redesigned to be CO2 neutral! But it isn't). Bottom line. If you're voting for someone to make you poorer to fix this .. then it probably won't fix this. Well ok .. I assumed you didn't already have 10 billion in the bank. For the rest of us, struggling in the 3, 4 or 5 digit range of salaries it's true.

The only solutions we have to get ahead of the curve are profoundly anti-current-capitalist. I'm sure capitalists could make money off the new ideas if we did them, but for now we are stuck with the current bunch. We need a massive change to localised food production and consumption, easily repairable white goods, a huge shift in what we subsidise (air fuel, agriculture, fracking, tax evading corporate profits) to what we actually need to support.

And... it's not happening. So yes. You have a good summary of the problems (you sort of gloss over aerosols, and that's a huge hit on the climate if we ever did cut back our current patterns). And all of them .. in one way or another .. will probably happen (and probably more that we never knew existed).

Back around the beginning of worries about climate change, the concern was voiced .. ""If you wait until you can see the changes happening, it's already too late"". And that was shot down as a pathetic way to get tax out of the public for a non existent threat. Yet here we are. We can see the changes happening, and yes, it is already too late.","2019-08-14 03:31:31","4","mogsington","1747944626.552639","fossil fuels aren't bad","manual"

40C is global warming's BIOSPHERE NUMBER, and the Ocean Masking Effect, which seems to completely blind scientists - and laymen too, surprisingly -  to truth of our situation,  is the Death Star of feed back loops, and the Death Star Loop is simple to understand: if the rate of ocean heat absorption significantly slows, or stops, or reverses, then Hothouse Earth arrives almost immediately thereafter, and the other loops, the methane bomb (or bombs), the BOE, the 8-12C cloud feedback loop, and all the rest, are only the sprinkles on the icing on a cake.

40C is the BIOSHPERE NUMBER. Attention paid anywhere else, at the expense of this number (1C? As opposed to 40C? Are you kidding me?), is just another form of climate change denial.

Sorry friend. Bad luck. I only have very vague advice to offer. Hold truth and intellectual honesty as your highest virtue. Even when the truth threatens to rob you of everything you have -- your friends, your family, your future, your hobbies, your own life. You can either be a slave to something that isn't true because it makes you feel a certain way, or you can become a slave to the only thing worth being a slave to: the truth. Once you have the truth, you can be empowered to move forward(or not take another step, if that's the best move). Without the truth, you are robbed of reality, to stumble around in darkness. Ignorance is an injury which not only harms you, but harms others -- at 16 you should be seeing this all around you, but you are burdened still with the ignorance of a highly confusing environment, as we all are to some significant degree until we die.

Crucial topics: 

* Evolutionary biology 
* Psychology(personality disorder, the psychopathic phenotype, cognitive biases like self deception and their evolutionary roots)
* Philosophy(Plato's The Allegory of the Cave -- I learned this exactly when I was your age, at 16, and without it I'd be deeply confused about epistemology. Also, start to try to understand the illusion of free will)
* World history(a big picture book like Sapiens/Guns, Germs... will suffice)
* Game theory(Prisoner's dilemma, terms like; non-zero sum, zero sum, negative sum)
* Physics - This one is a lot to ask of you, but it would benefit you greatly to understand the concept of time(illusion, sorry, again this is a lot to swallow) and the concept of entropy(this one is easy, things basically *turn into chaos*, they move from order to disorder as one moves through time). Conceptualize reality as a large billiard table consisting of an incomprehensible amount of balls, which represent the small particles that make up everything in this universe including your eyes and brain that read this sentence, bouncing around in a precisely mathematical way.
* ...and the concept of hierarchy(you know, like a pyramid). Apply this to the previous topics of psychology and evolutionary biology, game theory, and world history.

Best of luck to you from here. Oh and:

>were fucked nothings going to change, the major governments of the world don't care and that itself is the problem.

They certainly care, just not about what *you* care about. Reality is a game of chess, and often you sacrifice your pawns if you're a skilled player. There is no room for ethics if one wants to win a game of chess. If one says, ""But I do not *want* to sacrifice my pieces to win... I feel *bad* for them..."" they will lose the game. That's what this is. It's a game, and it will benefit you to see reality the way the ""winners"" see it: Purely as a game to be won or lost.  The only rule is the rule of evolution by natural selection: May the most powerful, most deceptive and cunning player win. Not just 'may', but they **will** win, this is set in stone.
