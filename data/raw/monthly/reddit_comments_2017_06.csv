"dicnzsy","t3_6erjjd","6erjjd","science","scientific","I think the big issues with the Paris Agreements have less to do with science and more to do with funding and politics.

Man made climate change exists. Anyone with an iota of critical reasoning should be able to look at the myriad of peer reviewed papers and interviews with credentialed experts on the subject, and logically come to the conclusion that this is an enormous problem that can only be tackled effectively on a global scale.

HOWEVER... the Paris Agreements are:

A) ineffective (allowing countries to tailor reduction goals in any way they seem fit)

B) toothless (no punishments for missing targets; ""peer pressure"" is how some of the developed world expects to ensure emerging markets keep their end of the bargain)

C) expensive ($100 billion a year minimum, from wealthy developed nations to emerging economies, in order to offset the cost of using more expensive ""green"" technology)

**NOTE: Depending on which article you read, the $100 billion dollar figure is either a yearly total paid by all the big developed countries... or the figure to be contributed yearly just by us in the USA. To date, we have pledged around 30% of the total funds for the United Nations Green Climate Fund ($3 billion from us, $7 billion from 42 other countries, for a little over $10 billion total). So I think it's fair to say that the amount would've been between $30 and $100 billion yearly from the US to other countries**

That's a lot of money to give away to other nations with no guarantees that they will follow through on their end, especially since the recipients include our economic competitors such as China and India. For comparison's sake, $30 billion is the amount America spends yearly on humanitarian aid throughout the world. This money could definitely yield better short term results if pumped into similar programs (clean water/combating AIDS or other diseases/lessening poverty), whether domestic or abroad. 

On the other hand, the US spends almost $4 trillion dollars a year; this is a small percentage to pay for us to combat such a large scale problem... especially when we know we'll be seeing multi-trillion dollar economic reductions once it starts to get real bad in the 2080's and the 2090's. 

Personally, I think the Paris Agreement was nothing more than political grandstanding, a proverbial pat on the back for all the world leaders. ""We did something about climate change, yay!"" I understand that it's hard to get almost 200 countries to agree on something, but the current language is so weak that it is practically useless. As Americans, what we need to do is push our elected officials to come up with a legitimate and detailed plan that actually spells out the monetary costs associated and the targets that must be met. It really doesn't have to be so expansive in number of countries - if we could get China, India, Pakistan, and the EU on board, we'd have the majority of the world's greenhouse gas emitters right there with us. Then we could use ""peer pressure"" to convince the smaller ones left. It is a much more rational and substantive way forward. 

Now, is the current administration going to lead the way forward with this? Almost certainly not. But that's a topic for another day.

Just some advice for those trying to convince others. 

Firstly don't cite 98% of scientists agree, firstly this isn't necessarily climate scientists and consensus of opinion is not part of the scientific process, consensus in observation is and you should focus on that point. 

Understand that not everyone will necessarily agree on your solution to climate change. Some people don't want to massively hinder their countries economy to make a small drop in the bucket.

I am a conservative. I believe in climate change. I believe it is mostly caused by man and has the potential to be catastrophic. However, I don't see anyone from the left or right taking an honest approach to solve this problem. 

The first main thing that no one talks about is nuclear. It supplies 20% of US energy right now. After all the government programs and huge pushes from organizations, where are renewables? 15%? Now, the first problem is that we aren't expanding nuclear. I have found no legitimate reason why nuclear shouldn't be pursued as a reasonable answer to fight climate change. Unsafe? False. Run out of uranium? False. The main argument I keep hearing is the same crap one I heard from Bill Nye on his new show - people dont want it. Well guess what, make people want it. We've spent so much forcing premature green energy into the market, I think we can afford a little education on an existing solution to this nightmare. 

Another part of this that no one wants to address is that if we don't persue nuclear, it doesn't just stay there. We've stopped making plants, and all existing ones are getting old, which means that 20% will be rapidly declining to 0 in the next 10-20 years. And what will fill that strong base load? Sorry to say it will definitely not be green. So.trying our best to push green energy, there will be a net loss as long we keep this up. 

Lastly, if we do want to make green energy work, prematurely forcing it into the market is costing us billions. Billions that should be spent on R&D. When it becomes economically viable and competitive, then go to market. And it will thrive.

Overall, I am happy with Trump's decision to pull out of this agreement. To me, it seemed like yet another attempt to grab money and pretend to do something about climate change without addressing any of these problems.

Have any efforts been made to run CMIP5 class climate models (or others) in an effort to minimize 21st century warming (perhaps its even possible to induce cooling some parameter regimes) under the constraints of a 1850-2000 hindcast, just to see what it would look like?


It seems to me that this kind of work is necessary to settle once in for all whether models really have too many tunable parameters to make reliable projections. I know people check sensitivity of climate sensitivity to various parameters but I haven't seen anyone actively try to produce the coolest 2100 temperatures while still matching the observational record.

"dj8suph","t3_6isyum","6isyum","science","scientific","In terms of solutions, isn't the overall effect that consumers have on global warming minuscule compared to manufacturing, energy, and agricultural industries? With waste production, people can recycle and reuse old containers, but that effort is a drop in the bucket that is quickly being filled by the aforementioned industries. My question is, can consumer habits truly change the trends in global warming? If everybody stopped eating animal products (the single largest source of greenhouse gasses), it would certainly make a substantial difference, but that will never happen. The most realistic scenario is that even if a growing number of people in the United States and Europe reduce their consumption of animal products, that reduction will be negated by the expanding middle class in developing countries. The question being, again, is individual responsibility in changing habits going to have any effect?

Edit: for clarity, I do believe that veganism and a priority towards waste-to-energy practices should be integral in our overall environmental policy, both as individual consumers and as commercial or political bodies.","2017-06-22 12:13:41","27","Sonseh","1747622816.0149498","climate science","scientific"
"dj949lf","t3_6isyum","6isyum","science","scientific","How much impact does personal change of lifestyle have? I would think a lot since without consumers large industries and corporations have no reason to do anything.

Over the months I have read scientific research and compiled as short as possible list of personal changes every person can make. Can you please look at it and see if I'm mistaken about something.


FOOD:

* **eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products (none is the best)**
* eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated, and produces plastic waste so drink tap water)
* eat proper portion sizes
* remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment so adopt don’t shop to discourage their production, and choose pets that are herbivores

ENERGY:

* **drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible, avoid flying**
* use efficient lightbulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room
* Unplug devices when not in use (to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet, some are very cheap)
* insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary
* criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much
* forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing. (that way more people get to live on less land, sharing walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.)
* buy solar panels
* don't be afraid of nuclear power plants

WASTE

* avoid items with too much packaging
* don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging)
* buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
* recycle
* avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery and cups e.g. bring reusable tumbler to Starbucks, disposable wipes, disposable plastic bags, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.)
* contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging

WATER:

* don't flush the toilet when not necessary
* don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids, and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...)
* turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc.
* cut down on showers and baths
* don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering 

ACTIVISM:

* Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle (feel free to share this list)
* Donate money to environmental charities
* Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicians
* Look into buying carbon emission offset (this is the only point on this list that I haven't researched yet, so I'm not sure)

I recently watched Cowspiracy, a documentary on how the world’s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about animal agriculture as being the primary reason for climate change (let alone numerous other problems) as encouraging more environmentally sustainable diets and apparently repels 'supporters' of these organizations. Instead of focusing on the fact that it takes ~660 gallons of water to make a hamburger, or ~4 gallons of water for a gallon of milk, these organizations encourage us that the transportation and domestic sectors are the primary reasons for climate change and other environmental ills. They tell us to fix leaky faucets and to do other small tasks as people do not like larger commitments.

In your opinion, what do you think must happen in order to spark this commitment? A grassroots movement? Education? More radical journalism which exposes the animal industry? Are we too late?

> I also lead an interdisciplinary centre looking at climate solutions, and I would welcome a discussion of ideas on possible solutions. Does solar geoengineering or large-scale carbon capture and storage have legs? Where should we concentrate research effort? Any whacky ideas we should look into?

I think that its likely changing the climate maybe an _easier_ challenge that changing human nature, at least in the short term, and therefore one of the most promising routes out of the climate challenges we are facing is a capitalistic one. If something is good (or less bad) for the planet _and_ makes financial sense it generally seems to appeal to those on both sides of the political spectrum. 

With this is mind, are they any avenues which you feel have potential to re-work markets while favouring the environment?

Two areas I am interested in are Carbon capture with manufacturing and hemp!

In the last year or two I have seen there are some recent developments in terms of cost effective carbon capture from the atmosphere, but also some talk about how carbon fibre [may be carcinogenic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11944536) and not ideal to use as a manufacturing material. I would be really interested if you have any thoughts or ideas on this subject? Sometimes people mention that the ideal carbon capture and manufacturing concept already exists in the tree, which is of course true, but not a solution to our problems as the capital yield at present for woodland is too small to be valued enough to keep around it seems. Carbon fibre seems like a magical material due to its strength, versatility, and recyclability. I cant help thinking of all the hard waste in landfill that could transition to being carbon based. 

Regarding hemp, there are not many developments in the last number of decades to ease production that I am aware of. The blocker for using hemp for clothing and paper (in an innumerably more ecologically friendly way than woodland) has been / is largely political. The tide seems to be turning at present and de-regulation of industrial (and other forms) of hemp in various nations. Have you performed (or are you aware of) any research of moving away from cotton and wood pulp and its effects on the environment? Any other thoughts on this area? (I know in the UK a university in North Wales have been looking at strains for cultivation in colder climates which could see a growth of the industry again here).

My questions is do you think that the increased UV ray exposure around the equator has a significant effect on the diversity of these birds?

Now, from what I understand, tropical climates and rainforests offer the proper conditions for flora and fauna to prosper, therefore, as a result engendering more species. With more plants and animals, it would make sense that because of this, there would be more genetic variation as animals and plants need to adapt to the environment that offers a whole a lot more of a variety of species than different climates. Over a period of time, where more animals are exposed to various dangers, adaptation to constant change for ""survival of species"" is what is going on here.

"dikroa6","t3_6fsur0","6fsur0","science","scientific","Dear Dr. Smith,

I read some of your paper and have some questions. One of the main variables you suggest is affecting the genetic structure of populations is the lineage extinction rate, where tropical species are undergoing less extinction than species at higher latitudes. 

But extinction rate is just a proxy for some other processes - like long-term climatic variability. So my first question is, what factors do we think contribute to extinction rate mechanistically?

Secondly, why would a group of species undergoing less extinction (tropical) compared to a group that is undergoing a lot of extinction (temperate) have more genetic diversity? I'm curious about how being around longer somehow increases your diversity.

And last question: as an aspiring developmental biologist, I really like looking at ""process"". The questions that drive me are mechanistic and process-oriented in nature. My phylogenetics friends have argued strongly in favor of looking at ""pattern"". What do you say?

"dikx6ae","t3_6fsur0","6fsur0","science","scientific","Hi Brian! Few questions for you from a fellow ecologist, apologies in advance I didn't have much time so if I misinterpreted anything please let me know:

1)  In figure 2 of your paper where you show the heatmap for the phylogeographic structure across all species, why do you think that there appears to be the greatest mean diversity well south of the equator/tropics?  Or am I interpreting this incorrectly?


2)  I notice that you say changes in climate since the Last Glacial Maximum were not significant in your model, but climate traits which are likely correlated to current latitude likely are.  But you later discuss that ""these environmental effects were particularly profound in northern latitudes, where large ice sheets covered much of the terrain"".  How can you reconcile these two things, do you think maybe the metric you used doesn't accurately capture the effects of glaciation on the temperate zones?

3)  I notice that lineage extinction rate is quite a significant difference, what do you think practically contributes to this metric?  Is it just a reflection of climate variability perhaps?

4)  How do you expect the strength of abiotic vs biotic forces separating the species to vary across this space?  would it be correct to say that we may be looking at abiotic forces playing a disproportionately larger role in the higher latitude than in the tropics?

5)  Have you thought of doing anything along the lines of QST vs FST comparisons to tease apart whether this variation you are seeing in phenotypic traits reflects local adaptation to a different latitude, or is just present because of neutral genetic processes like genetic drift?


Really enjoyed your paper! :) I notice your sample size for your Morphological data is 5 birds per trait, I'm a plant ecologist so unsure really when it comes to birds but is this a normal sample size or is it on the low side?

I'm a geography postgraduate student, but came into the department from an ecology background, so I am still finding out what geography is. What do you think it is, and how do you see us overcoming the divide and increasing specialization of human and physical geography?  I know people like Patricia Gober and Reginald Golledge  really advocate for synthesis and integration, but there is push back in the other direction saying that the union is pointless and geography doesn't really exist. 

I like that you define yourself as a geographer, I feel that even just doing that (rather than ""I'm a climate scientist"" for example) is important. What makes you different from a climate scientist?

"disjt8z","t3_6grkxy","6grkxy","science","scientific","Hi, Savannah GA checking in:  we went through Hurricane Matthew last year. 

We decided to stay in our home in order to defend it from looters and also because we had concerns of one or two particular trees potentially falling on our house, and we wanted to be here to mitigate as much water (rain) damage as we could. We are on high ground here, so storm sturge was a distant worry.

My question is:  we were very grateful to have running water and gas still functional in our home (of course we lost electricity for several days). We could heat water and food on the stove and we could flush toilets. Others were not as lucky. What has to happen in a hurricane to lose gas (or water)?  Why were we spared when others weren't?

I will take your answers into consideration of leaving the city if we are faced with another hurricane. Thank you!","2017-06-12 12:29:06","3","dragonfliesloveme","1747622905.616734","climate science","scientific"

My first questions concerns the weather aspect of your research. What kinds of variation have you found in hurricane tracks and formation zones that come with rising ocean temperates? Are you using deterministic weather models or probabilistic? Have you noticed models struggling or performing poorly when ocean temperatures rise, with indicators such as rising uncertainty and huge variations between model runs?

My second questions are about the mapping aspect. Do you simulate coastal flooding and storm surges, and if you do, what techniques do you use? Do you take into account physical changes to the terrain of Louisiana thanks to the Mississippi River? My graduate research is actually concerning this very concept so I'm interested to hear how another person in the geography field is coming on with a similar idea.

My question is about the impact of melting Arctic/Antarctic ice, and it's possible effect on oceanic currents like the Gulf Stream.
