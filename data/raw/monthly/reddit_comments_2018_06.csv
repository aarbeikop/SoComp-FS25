You can skip to 7:00 to start. The more libertarians learn about climate science, the more they reject it.

I have read articles that claim that if you can have a reasonable conversation with people, that describing the scientific consensus can help convince some people.

70&#37; of Americans can't name a living scientist!!!

Having spoken to people about climate change for 20 years I would estimate that perhaps 3&#37; of the population understands the immediate threat of climate change and things like albedo changes in the Arctic, 7000 methane pingos being formed in Siberia, the corrosion of shells of various plankton in the ocean, the need to draw down at least 10 billion tons a year of CO2 from the atmosphere, that many climate feed backs are not included in climate change projection models etc.

Humans just don't want to hear about climate change. People very close to me shut off science presentations created for The National Academies of Science that we were going to watch because the information scared the crap out of them and they had to tune it out even though they run a solar energy company. Many people simply want to BELIEVE THE LIES put forth and heavily funded by fossil fuel interests. [http://kochcash.org/the-kochtopus/](http://kochcash.org/the-kochtopus/)

A large portion of the population is just not intelligent enough to understand the science through no fault of their own. Humans were hunter gatherers for most of their existence and now have been thrust into a highly sophisticated technological society and they have not had time to adjust to modern complexity and science cognitively and emotionally.

Tribal association that helped humans survive now cause humans to reject the science that is not accepted by their modern day tribes. There is no greater glaring example of scientific illiteracy and the rejection of science than the Republican party members, although in many cases this probably  has to do with pure greed, and the huge payoffs for lying, which is another human flaw.

Most people hold superstitious beliefs while science is based on rational thinking and evidence. There is an inverse relationship between high IQ and scientific expertise and religious belief.

I hope some of this is helpful. Good luck with your efforts.

The heat wave this weekend is just going to be a Chinese hoax so just ignore it.","2018-06-29 01:11:03","3","extinction6","1747633691.665977","climate science","scientific"

Webster, Christopher R., Mahaffy, Paul R., *et al.*, [Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1093), *Science* (June 8, 2018).

>**Abstract**

>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.

#####Second study:

Eigenbrode, Jennifer L., Summons, Roger E., *et al.*, [Organic matter preserved in 3-billion-year-old mudstones at Gale crater, Mars](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1096), *Science* (June 8, 2018).

>**Abstract**

>Establishing the presence and state of organic matter, including its possible biosignatures, in martian materials has been an elusive quest, despite limited reports of the existence of organic matter on Mars. We report the in situ detection of organic matter preserved in lacustrine mudstones at the base of the ~3.5-billion-year-old Murray formation at Pahrump Hills, Gale crater, by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite onboard the Curiosity rover. Diverse pyrolysis products, including thiophenic, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds released at high temperatures (500° to 820°C), were directly detected by evolved gas analysis. Thiophenes were also observed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Their presence suggests that sulfurization aided organic matter preservation. At least 50 nanomoles of organic carbon persists, probably as macromolecules containing 5% carbon as organic sulfur molecules.
