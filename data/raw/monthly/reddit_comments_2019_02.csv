"egnmbqk","t3_ar6wt3","ar6wt3","climatechange","action-oriented","I’ll clarify. There is a consensus that CO2 has some impact on global temperatures. There is no consensus on that impact being catastrophic.

I’m not suggesting there’s a conspiracy. I’m saying they admitted they conspired. Read the leaked climategate emails. They coordinated to actively quash dissenting research and it’s publication.

I wouldn’t characterize it as a conspiracy in academia because that implies coordinated manipulation. It’s more a reflection of the increasing disproportion of liberals to conservatives among faculties and administrations. This is a well documented phenomenon. Climate alarmism is almost exclusively a liberal position. You’d be no more welcome on a typical college campus speaking out against climate alarmism than you would speaking out against abortion.","2019-02-17 11:03:23","4","Mad_magus","1747643388.897502","climate science","scientific"
"eglsbhb","t3_ar6wt3","ar6wt3","climatechange","action-oriented","Yes.

While it is true that ~97% of scientists agree that humans have some impact on global warming. It is NOT true that there is a consensus that the impact is catastrophic. Many among the 97% argue that the climate is relatively insensitive to CO2 concentrations and the computer model projections are too simple and inaccurate, etc. In other words, the percentage of scientists that are climate change alarmists is much lower than 97%.","2019-02-16 16:42:01","-1","Mad_magus","1747643388.9002051","climate science","scientific"
"egllfp5","t3_ar6wt3","ar6wt3","climatechange","action-oriented","The 97% consensus figure has been thoroughly discredited. See for example the following explanation of John Cook's paper claiming to demonstrate a 97% consensus: [http://joannenova.com.au/2013/07/thats-a-0-3-consensus-not-97/](http://joannenova.com.au/2013/07/thats-a-0-3-consensus-not-97/) The whole thing is a pantomime and I'm shocked there are still people out there gullible enough to accept the AGW propaganda ","2019-02-16 14:57:50","-6","[deleted]","1747643388.902189","climate science","scientific"
