"d8ly3o3","t3_56s7qc","56s7qc","climate","scientific","My understanding is that nearly all of their projections are (1) based on a sharp decline in fossil fuel use within a number of years, which assumes some kind of magical technological transformation or severe deliberate economic recession globally (both highly improbable) (2) they include massive carbon capture projects in the second half of the 20th Century that would require technology we don't have and planting a massive amount of trees covering a significant portion of the planet. It's geoengineering at a scale that is beyond anything we could imagine. And that's their *conservative* projection. (Moreover, when trees are stressed by heat they release CO2, so it's pretty sketchy if such a massive tree planting would work in a 2-3 degree world.)

In short, what seem to be simple, straight forward projections are actually incredibly disturbing projections when you realize they take into account magical unproven technology, a massive technological transformation within a matter of years, or a global economic collapse (like the fall of the soviet union but worldwide).","2016-10-10 15:28:02","10","[deleted]","1747667230.883934","IPCC report","scientific"
"d8m2vgl","t3_56s7qc","56s7qc","climate","scientific","Well for instance sea level rise had too a conservative estimate in the latest IPCC report, it under-estimated the sealevel rise that actually occurred.

Also, the models overestimated the global temperature anomaly for the past few years (we now know that to be due to the ocean's heat uptake effect). 

Considering IPCC freezes all models fairly early for their next report, the results MUST be a bit outdated from the latest science.

But whether or not there is a bias in the whole process due to governments steering it, it is extremely hard to tell.","2016-10-10 17:08:09","6","rojimbo0","1747667230.887375","IPCC report","scientific"
"d8mefve","t3_56s7qc","56s7qc","climate","scientific","As UN products, IPCC reports must pass muster with major fossil fuel producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia before publication. Needless to say, that keeps these reports on the safe side. And, because they emerge only every seven years, they tend to understate the problem even more, because new data has grown consistently more alarming.

The reports are prepared by thousands of volunteers, many of whom are among the world's top climate scientists and economists. 

I think of IPCC reports as the *minimum* that we should be concerned about. They regularly understate the situation, especially with regard to ice loss, sea level rise and feedback cycles.","2016-10-10 21:04:21","3","Splenda","1747667230.89042","IPCC report","scientific"

"d8lxuvc","t3_56s7qc","56s7qc","climate","scientific","Just off the top of my head I thought that there were several models/outcomes in the last IPCC report that ranged from global warming having a very mild impact with less than ~1C in warming by 2100 to an extreme outcome with more than ~5C warming by 2100.  I think that science can be directed or steered (or silenced) by money or governments, and obviously this is happening with climate science, I just don't know how it affects the IPCC reports.

I think that it's definitely possible that the IPCC has been steered by those who want to diminish the threat that AGW poses to society, although I think they would eliminate the more severe models from their reports if they were going to do that.  Who knows, maybe they are being manipulated...","2016-10-10 15:22:40","2","His_Horse_Is_Crazy","1747667230.8957188","IPCC report","scientific"
"d8m1bv1","t3_56s7qc","56s7qc","climate","scientific","They are scientists as serious and as good scientist as you can get. However they are also human. As humans they are vulnerable to; 

1. Confirmation bias as in "" I have never experienced mass extinction thus mass extinction can't happen in my lifetime"".

2. Fear of death. Climate change carries with it the possibility of lethal catastrophe. Pondering this throws a wrench in any healthy mind, which leads to grief and all its stages. Psychologically the path of least resistance is to ignore the threat. Many scientist have unconsciously chosen this path. I don't blame them. I envy them.

3. Peer pressure. It is very bad form for a scientist to predict the end of the world. Science history is littered with brilliant scientists that threw away their credibility and scientific careers by wrongly proclaiming the end of the world. So to avoid negative peer pressure, their work dance around evidence giving hints of catastrophe but never achieving definitive conclusions. 

4. Credibility. The climate is the mother of all human relevant random systems so it carries much uncertainty. Within that uncertainty the data is clearly pointing to substantial change, but how it will play out or whether it plays out at all is in the realm of speculation.  So they make predictions like 1 meter sea level rise in a hundred years or 4 degrees C in a hundred years. The more time they give their prediction the higher the chances they will be right. However climate change plays out, in a hundred years it will be warmer, but they don't know how it will play out.


All these biases and many more accumulate over the body of science distorting it. When the science is then synthesized for bureaucratic consumption, then the real risk are glossed over and disregarded. Add a concerted effort by some groups to minimize climate change and what you get is a fictional document based on very good science.","2016-10-10 16:36:42","2","Archimid","1747667230.900106","IPCC report","scientific"
"d8mbbmp","t3_56s7qc","56s7qc","climate","scientific","1+1 = 2 in every country of the world. The laws of gravity are the same in every country in the world. Our understandings of climate change science are the same the world over. Fossil fuel funded climate change denial entities have done a great job in fooling many people in believing otherwise. That being said the IPCC has been too conservative in their estimates of the rate of change.

The IPCC reports have underestimated the decline of Arctic Sea ice as well as sea level rise because temperature feed backs that were not previously well understood were not included in the models. Scientists cannot predict how significant future methane releases will be as well as other feed backs.

As already mentioned IPCC reports that show a meaningful reduction in future temperature scenarios assume that a carbon capture miracle will be found.

For people that have not watched it yet Kevin Anderson's presentation on our carbon budget IMHO this is still one of the best assessments that I have seen yet and that is why I keep posting it.

He believes scientists are somewhat under pressure not to tell people how bad things are.

Although the Arctic sea ice was only the second lowest extent on record a lot of the ice that was measured was not strong, solid ice.
As we lose the reflective snow and ice cap that reflects the Sun's energy back into space more heat is being absorbed by the darker surfaces. If this continues it will not be long before more feed backs kick in accelerating the warming even faster.

Ocean heating is killing reefs around the world and ocean acidification is already wreaking havoc on the small shell forming organisms that are the base food of many oceanic food chains.

There should be a WW2 level attempt by all governments to develop carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will reduce the level of catastrophes that we will experience in the future as the changes that we have already caused reach equilibrium.

For those people that haven't yet learned how the Arctic Amplification is affecting global temperatures the following is a fairly comprehensive overview.

"d8mdtqh","t3_56s7qc","56s7qc","climate","scientific","The IPCC is primarily written by many of the top scientists in the world, they most certainly act very ethically. They include top climate scientists, as well as scientists who study the impacts of a changing climate, and others who focus on adaptation to a changing climate. The reports are edited by a very large number of scientists, government officials, and policy experts. It isn't a very rigorous process. The primary source of information is from peer reviewed journal papers, as well as climate models (using all of the major climate models from around the world) specifically carried out for IPCC. However, it is  important to remember that the published science reported in the IPCC reports was carried out a few yrs prior to the IPCC reports, hence are not the most up to date science. Also remember that they use a range of carbon emissions scenarios in the climate models runs. They do this because we do not know how society is going to control carbon emissions over the coming decades. The emission scenarios vary from ""business as usual"" to the best case scenario where carbon emissions are reduced as quickly as we think they can be.
