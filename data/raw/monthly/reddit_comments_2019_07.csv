Mankind truly destroys all it comes in contact with, it’s a sad reality, but it’s the truth. There is more potential in the world. I’ve had it told to me many times that Homo sapiens are the only species that can think about long term future gains. The example is with the study on chimpanzees, I believe. Researchers have placed food inside a basket (something a monkey would want to eat, obviously) and let the monkey try to get it out through the gaps and openings in the basket. Monkeys apparently only think of the now rather than the long term sustainability of not eating whatever’s in the basket for the sake of using your hand to its full potential.
