"9w7cm0","climatechange","action-oriented","Compehensive Popular science book about climate change","We hear so much about climate change but it is mainly from bloggers, influencers, media. We seldom hear from scientist ourselves, apart from the occasional minute  segment on TV.
So do anybody know of a comprehensive book written about the topic about the history, mechanisms and how we know what we know about climate change.
Im thinking of something like Bill Brysons A short history of nearly everything, or siddharta mukherjees book about cancer, extensive but still comprehensible to a non-scientist.

I wanna learn more about the hows, whys and evidence instead of being forcefed information about it from some 20 year old vegan with xxx followers on instagram.","2018-11-11 20:51:42","12","18","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9w7cm0/compehensive_popular_science_book_about_climate/","True","azulti","1747640316.6403651","climate science","scientific"
