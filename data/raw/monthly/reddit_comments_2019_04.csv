The difference  between AMAs and discussions is that discussions will happen much less  frequently and will always be led by a team of scientists so that we can  hear multiple expert perspectives and answer many more questions. As with our AMAs, discussion posts will be posted in the morning to allow  topics and questions for the panel to come in ahead of the panelists  arriving to participate. Also, similarly to our AMAs our moderation of  these events will be extremely strict, so please make sure you read and  follow our rules in the sidebar.

This topic seems to cause contention all around the world. [In New Zealand](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/environmental-health/drinking-water/drinking-water-legislation) we are battling a few challenges related to drinking water. In some regions of New Zealand agricultural pollution is primary cause for concern, where in other regions rapid growth in population is outpacing infrastructure upgrades. For example, in Christchurch, a city (formerly) renowned for its 'pure' artisan spring-water straight from the tap, has [introduced water chlorination](https://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/water-and-drainage/water-supply/water-chlorination/#12/-43.5308/172.6363).
