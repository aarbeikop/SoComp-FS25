"56s7qc","climate","scientific","What is your view on the IPCC reports?","There have been quite a few articles suggesting that IPCC reports make overly optimistic, bordering on delusional, assumptions to reduce the impact of AGW in their reports.

Do you agree with these sentiments? 
Were the scientists acting on behalf of the governments they represent and not accurately describing the science? Do you feel they acted unethically?
Are there other competing models that accurately reflect what we know about AGW?
Who are these IPCC scientists? Are they known science experts promoting AGW or mostly bureaucrats?
