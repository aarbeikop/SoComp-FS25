Many big orgs coordinating. Link and info in comments.","WE NEED TO ORGANIZE UNDER ONE UMBRELLA TO SHOW REAL POWER.

Hi I’m an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march:

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? 
________

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let’s take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn’t happen. Game over.

_________

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they’re at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and … ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

__________
REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

______________
MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There’s a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

LOCAL MAYORS ARE PROVING AWESOME

Also, local moves. Mayors are powerful:

Reply here to keep brainstorming. It feels good to at least be doing something.

And social media is how Trump won, we can wield it too. It's an insanely powerful force for any movement when the communication is solid.



**TLDR:
There's a major march to stay in the Paris Agreement and combat Climate Change. It's in D.C. on April 29, 2017. [Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). This is our chance, please come! And link other organizations so we can build one massive movement and make this issue CENTRIST and CENTRAL to our government and all Americans.**","2016-12-03 19:36:32","6091","247","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5gb9wg/the_massive_climate_change_march_is_happening/","True","groovesmerchant","1747616970.258023","climate science","scientific"
"5kwock","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: We're scientists on a boat in the Southern Ocean (Antarctic Ocean) studying climate change, ocean physics and marine biology, Ask Us Anything!","Hi reddit, I'm [Greta Shum](http://www.climatecentral.org/what-we-do/people/greta-shum), and I work as a science communicator at Climate Central. I'm out here on a boat off the coast of Antarctica with other scientists who are studying different aspects of the Southern Ocean. In my usual work, I try to communicate the facts about climate change (causes and effects) at Climate Central. As part of that mission, I'm following three science projects that are focused on the state of the Southern Ocean and how it will change in the future. 

One group is studying ocean physics along the shelf of the Amundsen Sea; one group studies the microbiology and consequent evolution of the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean, and one group (SOCCOM) studies the carbon chemistry of the Southern Ocean and how it will change in the future.

With me are the following scientists: 


[Professor Stephen Riser](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/home/Stephen+Riser) is a Professor of Physical Oceanography at the University of Washington, interested in the ocean's role in climate, and in deducing the general circulation of the ocean and ocean/atmosphere/ice interactions through direct observations of the ocean circulation.


[Caitlin Whalen, PhD](http://www.apl.washington.edu/people/profile.php?last_name=Whalen&first_name=Caitlin) of the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is an expert in ocean mixing. 


[Professor Tatiana Rynearson](http://www.gso.uri.edu/profile/rynearson/) from U. of Rhode Island: My area of research is in marine genomics and population genetics. My goals are to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping genetic diversity in the plankton and to examine how those processes affect plankton community structure, function and productivity in coastal regions. My approach is to identify and exploit the genetic variation that exists within and between individuals to examine how plankton respond to their environment.


[Professor Sinead Collins](http://www.smallbutmighty.bio.ed.ac.uk/) from the U. of Edinburgh:

 I'm interested in how large populations of small organisms adapt to complex environmental changes. Since that's a bit too vague, I focus on how marine phytoplankton adapt to ocean acidification. I use experimental evolution in the lab to figure out the basic theory involved, and then head off to collaborate with oceanographers to apply it to marine systems.

We’ll be back at 1 pm EST (10 am PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask us anything!

"5iha6f","science","scientific","Science AMA series: I'm Brian Buma, Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska. I study forest disturbances around the world, focusing on emerging mortality associated with climate change and carbon/water/forests as an integrated system. AMA!","Hi reddit!

I am a disturbance ecologist (think fires, windstorms, landslides) that primarily studies the response of forested ecosystems to emerging disturbances triggered by climate change.  I'm particularly interested in how resilient forests may be to these new stresses - and if that resilience is a good thing.  Will our forests recover from future disturbances?  What will that recovery look like?  Does this recovery – or lack thereof – help or hinder species ability to migrate in response to climate change?  What new disturbances are emerging?  

One striking example of all of these issues is the emerging mortality of species along the remote southeast Alaskan and Canadian west coast, where 400,000 ha (so far) of trees have died due to low snow conditions brought about by warming winters.  The cause is surprisingly related to freezing – the soil is no longer insulated by snow, so cold snaps can kill.  This is an emerging disturbance that we are just beginning to study, and it’s dramatically changing the forest community.  But it also appears to be associated with migration in other, less climate sensitive species.  So perhaps this disturbance, and others, are facilitating the migration of species into more favorable climates.  It’s a complex ecological story of adaption/maladaptation and creative destruction (so to speak), and great fun to investigate.

Most of my work involves a focus on either forest biodiversity, forest carbon, or water resources, and I've worked in Hawaii, the Rocky Mountains, and Alaska, and collaborated on projects around the world using a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing/satellites, GIS, and modeling.  I am also the caretaker of what is believed to be the longest running permanent study plots studying primary succession in the world in Glacier Bay, Alaska (100 years and counting).  So the data comes from a lot of sources, and I'm happy to discuss integration of methods as well.

**I will be answering  your questions at 1 PM  ET, AMA!**


Edit:  Thanks everyone!  Some really interesting and thought provoking questions in here, and it's humbling and exciting to see so many people concerned and interested in the state of the world's forests.  There were lots of great ideas for next steps, projects, etc mentioned here and I'd love to hear how those progress.

I have to run for a meeting but I'll check back in tonight (it's only 1PM in Alaska right now, after all, lots of time) and keep on doing what I can.   

Edit 2:  And I'm back for a bit.  This is really fun.  

...off for dinner.  Will log in later to reply further.  

In the meantime, most of my work is posted on my website, and for those great questions about coastal forests I would encourage you to check out the Alaska Coastal Rainforest Center (http://acrc.alaska.edu/) for all things coastal forest related.  Feel free to email with questions as well, I'm always looking for interested students and research collaborations, in addition to partners in management and policy.

Alrighty, it's late in Alaska, so I'm done (and Denzel is online...).  Thanks so much for your questions!

We are team members representing a first-of-its-kind project, the Oil-Climate Index (OCI). The OCI analyzes the overall climate impacts of different oils from extraction to refining to combustion. We did [another AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3jlwuc/askscience_ama_series_were_a_team_of_researchers/) about the OCI a year ago, and we’re back to discuss Phase II of the project. We tested 75 oils from different sources around the globe, and you can find the results of our [research here](http://oci.carnegieendowment.org/), as well as other resources including infographics and our methodology. We’re excited to discuss the new research with you all, as well as the global implications of these results.


A bit about our team:


[Deborah Gordon](http://carnegieendowment.org/experts/?fa=558) is the Director of the Energy and Climate Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Her research focuses on the climate implications of unconventional oil in the U.S. and around the world. She’s happy to answer questions about the how the [OCI project](http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/03/11/know-your-oil-creating-global-oil-climate-index) got started, [stakeholder interests](http://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/OilClimateIndex/?lang=en), implications for policymaking, and the next steps for the OCI.


[Adam Brandt](https://earth.stanford.edu/adam-brandt) is an assistant professor in the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University. His research focuses on reducing the greenhouse gas impacts, with a focus on energy systems. Adam will be talking about the OPGEE model he developed that estimates upstream oil extraction emissions and its implications for decisionmaking.


[Joule Bergerson](https://www.ucalgary.ca/jbergers/) is an associate professor in the Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department and the Center for Environmental Engineering at the University of Calgary. Her primary research interests are systems-level analysis of energy investment and management for policy and decisionmaking. Joule will be talking about the model she developed that estimates the midstream oil refining emissions and its implications for decisionmaking.


[Jonathan Koomey](http://www.koomey.com/about.html) is a research fellow at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University. He is an internationally known expert on the economics of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of information technology on resources. He can answer questions about the model he and Gordon developed that calculates the downstream oil product combustion emissions, as well as other big picture energy and climate questions.

"5g34kf","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: We're researchers at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, who just published a pair of papers on buried ice deposits and potential volcano/ice and impact/ice interactions on Mars: ask us anything!","Hi!

We're Dr. Joe Levy and  Cassie Stuurman—we study geological systems in cold regions on Earth to try to understand the evolution of the surface of Mars and how cold landscapes on Earth record evidence of climate change.


Ice is one of the most important, but least appreciated geological materials. It flows and melts when local climate conditions are warm, and piles up when conditions are cold. You can drink it, measure the chemical fingerprint of past ice ages locked away in it, and even look for modern and ancient microbial life in it. So how do we use planetary analogs on Earth to understand surface processes on Mars? Where is the ice on Mars? How similar is it to glacial and permafrost landforms on Earth? What kind of changes to the surface of Mars and Earth have been wrought by changing climate over the last few million years? How are we going to use ice on Mars when humans begin to settle on that planet?


This is the paper Joe published - [Candidate volcanic and impact-induced ice depressions on Mars](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103516302093)

and this is the paper Cassie published - [SHARAD Detection and Characterization of Subsurface Water Ice 
Deposits in Utopia Planitia, Mars](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070138/full)


And here's the original Reddit post that made it to the front page - [A strangely shaped depression on Mars could be a new place to look for signs of life on the Red Planet, according to a study. The depression was probably formed by a volcano beneath a glacier and could have been a warm, chemical-rich environment well suited for microbial life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5clq6b/a_strangely_shaped_depression_on_mars_could_be_a/?st=iw2p5j3z&sh=a95d8428)

2016 was an amazing year for science, and much of the breakthrough research appeared in the pages (both physical and digital) of Science Magazine.  Now, we're working on a special end-of-year issue that will bestow upon one scientific achievement the title of ""Breakthrough of the Year.""
 
Every December, Science magazine announces a Breakthrough of the Year and a short list of runners-up. We, the writers and editors, comb through the year’s scientific advances--with help from the Board of Reviewing Editors and other scientists--and judge which have done the most to benefit humanity, answer long-standing questions, or pave the way for fruitful new research.
 
It’s a tricky task. Many discoveries take years to catch fire; others seem exciting but never fulfill their promise. And even when something big happens in science, it’s not always obvious exactly when and where the “breakthrough” took place. Here is our list of ""greatest hits.""
 
All that said, we also have [People's Choice award](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/vote-your-scientific-breakthrough-year), and this year, we wanted to come to Reddit to talk about the year in science and what you think might deserve the Breakthrough of the Year award.
