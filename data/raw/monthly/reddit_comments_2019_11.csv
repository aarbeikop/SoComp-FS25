"f8j90qf","t3_e0xahf","e0xahf","collapse","skeptical","> Please understand and acknowledge the following: We are completely  delusional and out of touch with reality. William Wilberforce did not  understand slavery and Henry David Thoreau did not understand slavery.  For them it is an intellectual abstraction in their heads. [Celia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Missouri_v._Celia,_a_Slave)  understood slavery, because she lived it. We don´t understand climate  change, because we live in concrete cities where we are kept alive by  industrial agriculture. The people who understand climate change are the  indigenous people who live in the Amazon rainforest, or the farmers in  India who commit suicide.  

You don't have to be an aboriginal farmer to understand climate change, and you don't have to be a slave to understand slavery.

I do see a strange parallel between slavery and climate change though. You could also add creationism and the pro-gun political movement in America. What they all have in common is a cultural failure to accept reality, and they all come from the worst sort of ""right wing"" elements of American culture. The people who have been denying the reality of climate change are basically saying ""You can't tell us what to believe! You can't make us stop doing what we're doing, even if it is morally wrong and/or scientifically backwards."" They are the same people who continued to fight the American civil war - tens of thousands of men choosing to die on the battlefield in a futile attempt to defend their freedom to enslave other human beings -- even after Gettysburg, when the war was clearly lost.","2019-11-24 12:10:50","27","Spotted_Blewit","1747652308.843874","climate science","scientific"

"f8luviq","t3_e0xahf","e0xahf","collapse","skeptical","I’ve been thinking about abstractions.

You would imagine we could create this into a less of an abstraction?

I know how far removed we are, I really do see that.

I know though with the many many people I at least meet there is a very very real urge and desire to comprehend this on a degree that ‘clicks’ and is made clear.

My interpretation?

This is an abstraction so large we are stretching the very comprehension of even the most capable of us.

We need some sort of overarching well defined descriptor that isn’t somehow conflated and constricted by modern media.

We must and have to get past this stupid fixation of slapping on some sort of spin or ideology.

We can’t get basic enough with this shit.

we are killing ourselves.

Doesn't make sense. The equatorial area will remain warmer than northern parts no matter how much the global average temperature will rise. In addition, the wet bulb temperature will be higher there too because of the less humid air.

There are northern countries that actually are expected to benefit from climate change, at least to a certain point because it lengthens the crop growing season etc.","2019-11-24 15:41:31","-3","x102oo","1747652308.871294","climate science","scientific"
