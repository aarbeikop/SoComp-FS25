Hi reddit! 

I’m Ken Caldeira and I work on a broad array of issues including the physical climate system, global energy systems, ocean acidification, and geoengineering. With the exception of the ocean acidifcation work, all of our research is based on performing simulations using computer models. Solar geoengineering involves trying to cool the Earth by deflecting some incoming sunlight away from our planet. Studies have shown that actions like putting small particles in the stratosphere could reflect some sunlight away from the Earth, potentially taking our climate back to a point similar to pre-industrial revolution.  Of course, we know for sure about only one habitable planet, and toying around with this planet at the required scale would pose great risks -- but allowing the Earth to warm from our greenhouse gas emissions also poses grave risks. Given that it is going to take time to transform our energy system into one that does not dump its waste in the atmosphere, what is the best path forward?

I’m Ben van der Pluijm and I work in hazards geology and societal impacts of global change. The goal of 2016’s Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) is ideal, but unlikely from voluntary greenhouse gas emission reductions alone.  Building on our remarkable history of engineering applications to overcoming societal challenges, climate engineering should be included as a viable solution for reducing the impacts of global warming.  Climate engineering takes two approaches: (1) Carbon dioxide removal, and (2) solar radiation management.  The former addresses the cause of climate warming by removing greenhouse gas from the atmosphere (""treat the illness"").  The latter offsets the warming effects of greenhouse gases by allowing Earth to absorb less solar radiation (""treat the symptoms"").  Given their worldwide impact, planning must occur on a global scale, involving all nations, large and small, rich and poor, and not be limited to a few technologically advanced, wealthy countries.

We’re looking forward to answering questions about environmental change and dealing with the impacts for human society, and whether various geoengineering techniques could really be expected to reduce climate damage and decrease damage to both ecosystems and people.

Ask us anything!","Hey Reddit! We’re organizers from the March for Science, here to answer your questions about the March. 

The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.

The March for Science got started with a reddit discussion on /r/politics about a Scientists’ March on Washington. We scientists took that initial interest and started a website and social media accounts to start recruiting. The march quickly gained hundreds of thousands of followers on social media and became the March for Science, an event planned to take place in over 400 cities across the globe, with hundreds of thousands of people expected to attend.

We are:

**Dr. Jonathan Berman** - National Co-Chair

I’m a postdoctoral fellow at UTHSCSA. I study how the kidney reabsorbs sodium and the relationship between sodium reabsorption and blood pressure. 
I’m one of three national co-chairs for the March for Science, along with Dr. Caroline Weinberg, and Valorie Aquino. 

**Dr. Rachael Holloway** - National Diversity & Inclusion Lead

I’m a clinical psychologist who specializes in behavioral medicine, trauma, and neurocognitive disorders. My graduate program has won national awards for its training in diversity and its rate of graduating underrepresented minority students. In my postdoctoral fellowship at VA San Diego/UCSD, I served on the diversity committee and completed mentorships in diversity and social justice advocacy.

Sci Comm writer focused on returning optimism to science and science fiction. Creator of several comics designed to promote skepticism, scientific wonder, and a dedication to accurate science in literature. Organizing the the Satellite March for Science group in the beautiful city of Seattle Washington.  

**Dr. Bryan Dunyak** - Steering Committee, Chair of Marketing & Tech, [March For Science - San Francisco](https://marchforsciencesf.com)

I’m a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California at San Francisco. I study the role of cellular housekeeping mechanisms and their misregulation in cancer and neurodegeneration. I am passionate about science outreach; I have a long history working as a moderator with /r/science to encourage scientific discussion while helping to bridge the gap between practicing scientists and the public.

"60udlh","science","scientific","PLOS Science Wednesday: We're Kaitlin Raimi, Paul Stern, and Alex Maki, we research how to talk about climate change, Ask Us Anything!","Hi Reddit,

My name is [Kaitlin Raimi](http://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/kaitlin-raimi) and I am an Assistant Professor at the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on how people think and act when it comes to climate change, including how social motivations can promote or prevent sustainable solutions. I'm particularly interested in how people compare their own beliefs and behaviors to those of other people, how the desire to make a good impression can influence people to mitigate climate change, and how one adopting one sustainable behavior affects later environmental decisions. I also have ongoing work on how framing climate change in different ways affects people's understanding of climate change and support for climate policies.


Together with my colleagues [Paul Stern](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/BECS/DBASSE_068036) and [Alex Maki](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/viee/profiles/Alex-Maki.php), I recently published a paper titled [""The Promise and Limitations of Using Analogies to Improve Decision-Relevant Understanding of Climate Change""](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171130&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=ama&utm_campaign=redditama-0322) in the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/).


My name is Alex Maki and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment and the Vanderbilt Climate Change Research Network. My research uses theory-based behavior change interventions to understand and influence environmental (e.g., energy use), health (e.g., eating choices), and prosocial (e.g., volunteerism) behaviors. Specifically, I am interested in how interventions can help people initiate and maintain changes to multiple, related behaviors over time (e.g., both conserve energy and water at home). I also examine the social dynamics surrounding environmental behaviors, including who chooses to talk to other people (e.g., friends or family) about environmental issues, and how we can help people have more constructive conversations about important environmental issues, including climate change.


My name is Paul Stern.  For over two decades I was staff director of the Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change at the U.S. National Research Council.  At the same time, I have been conducting research with colleagues outside the Council on topics that have included household energy consumption, the effectiveness of policies to reduce greenhouse has emissions by changing consumer behavior, and people's understanding of various kinds of environmental risks.  Understanding the risks of climate change is a real challenge because of its long-term nature and the difficulty of making confident predictions of what risks particular communities will face.  This paper is part of an effort to find ways to help people think through the risks without having to understand all the scientific details.
 

We wanted to know whether using analogies helps people understand key factors that are important for climate change decisions, including uncertainties about when and where serious damage may occur, its unprecedented and progressive nature, and trade-offs in limiting climate change. Specifically, across two studies, we looked at whether comparing climate change to medical decision-making, disaster preparedness, or courtroom trials helped people to understand these issues. We found that disaster preparedness and a courtroom trial analogy weren't very helpful, and that none of the analogies helped people understand the basic science of climate change. However, we did find that comparing climate change to a medical decision helped people--especially political conservatives--to to better recognize several decision-relevant attributes of climate change.
