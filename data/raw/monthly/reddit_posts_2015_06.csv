"38nt2y","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: Pulling the plug: Melting ice and draining lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We’re Laura Stevens and Dr. Sarah Das, glaciologists at MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, here to talk about all things ice! AMA!","Yesterday we published a [paper in Nature on supraglacial lake drainages on the Greenland Ice Sheet](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=50242&tid=3622&cid=217909). Supraglacial lakes form on the surface of the ice sheet during the summer, when temperatures get above freezing in the daytime. In a 2008 study, we discovered that these lakes, some of which are miles wide, can drain in a matter of hours through long cracks known as hydro-fractures that open in the lakebed. These drainage events send a flood of meltwater comparable to Niagra Falls thousands of feet straight down to the bottom of the ice sheet.  The meltwater causes the ice to temporarily speed up, moving more ice to the edge of the ice sheet where it calves off into the ocean as icebergs. It’s important to know where and when lakes will drain in order to predict how fast the ice sheet is moving and how much the ice sheet contributes to sea level rise.  

Since that study in 2008 we have been working hard to figure out what triggers these hydro-fractures, and what that might mean for the future of the ice sheet (and for people elsewhere on the planet) in a warming climate. We do this by traveling every summer to lakes on the ice sheet via helicopter, setting up GPS stations around the lakes, and then using our measurements to observe how the ice sheet surface moves during lake drainage events. We found that enough meltwater gets down to the bottom of the ice sheet before the lake drains to cause the ice sheet surface to be pushed up and stretched. This stretching causes new fractures to form, and once one of those fractures intersects the lake, water from the lake drives the crack open and the lake is history. 

We will be back at 1:00 pm EDT (10:00 am PDT, 5:00 pm UTC) to answer your questions about Greenland lakes, global warming, or the life of a scientist doing research on the ice sheet. AMA! 

EDIT: Thanks, everyone for your questions. We're signing off now. You gave us a lot to think about next time we're out on the ice. Until then, you can keep up with recent information about glaciers and ice sheets here.[](http://www.whoi.edu/main/topic/glaciers-ice-sheets)
