"52q3qu","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I’m Jeremy Martin, here to talk about gasoline, ethanol, electricity and the future of transportation fuel. AMA!","Hi, I’m [Jeremy Martin](http://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/jeremy-martin.html), a researcher with the Union of Concerned Scientists. I have a PhD in chemistry, and, despite a former career in computer chip development and manufacturing, currently study the carbon intensities of different transportation fuels. I specialize in understanding the science behind, and policies around, various biofuels, but have recently begun looking at unconventional sources of oil (such as tar sands and tight oil). It’s clear that our fuel mix is changing; it’s less clear what road we’ll take, and what it’ll mean for the climate.

Earlier this year I published “[Fueling a Clean Transportation Future](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/clean-fuels/transportation-fuels-future),” a report that compares the different futures that lay ahead of gasoline, electricity, and ethanol. Just this week we also published an online web feature that looks at some of these issues, that you can use [here](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/oil-is-changing).

Let’s talk fuel (or anything else)! I’ll be here for about two hours starting at 11am eastern.

Edit (1:07pm eastern): That's it for me. This has been a blast. Thanks everyone! - Jeremy","2016-09-14 12:00:21","3817","765","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/52q3qu/science_ama_series_im_jeremy_martin_here_to_talk/","True","ConcernedScientists","1747614378.87284","climate science","scientific"
