AMA!","Hi Reddit,

We're Margaret Kosmala and Koen Hufkens at Harvard University and Josh Gray at Boston University. We're part of a research group that has been putting automated cameras on weather towers and other elevated platforms to study the the seasonal timing of changes in plants, shrubs, and trees – called 'phenology'. Because this timing of when plants leaf, flower, and fruit is very sensitive to changes in weather, plant phenology alerts us to changing climate patterns. Our network of about 300 cameras ('PhenoCams') take pictures of vegetated landscapes every half hour, every day, all year round. (That's a lot of pictures!) With the data from these images we can figure the relationships between plant phenology and local weather and then predict the effects of future climate using models. 

We also use images from satellites to broaden the extent of our analyses beyond the 300 specific sites where we have cameras. And we use citizen science to help turn our PhenoCam images into usable data, through our [Season Spotter project](http://seasonspotter.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit). Anyone can go to Season Spotter and answer a few short questions about an image to help us better interpret the image. Right now we are running a “spring challenge” to classify 9,500 images of springtime. With the results, we will be able to pinpoint the first and last days of spring, which will help calibrate climate change models.

UPDATE: We're done with our Season Spotter spring images, thanks! Since it's fall in half the world, we've loaded up our [fall images](http://seasonspotter.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit). We have another 9,700 of those to classify, as well. 

We'll be back at 1 pm EDT (10 am PDT, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions; we're looking forward to talking to you about climate change, plants, and public participation in science!

UPDATE 1 pm Eastern: We're now answering questions!

UPDATE 3 pm Eastern: Josh has to leave for a meeting. But Koen and Margaret will stick around and answer some more questions. Ask away if you have more of them.

UPDATE 5 pm Eastern: Koen and I are done for the day, and we've had a lot of fun. Thank you all for so many insightful and interesting questions! We'll try to get to more of the ones we missed tomorrow.","2016-03-31 11:24:04","2905","449","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4cpl6d/science_ama_series_we_are_margaret_kosmala_koen/","True","Seasonspotter","1747608640.345692","climate science","scientific"

I'm here to talk with you about oceanography and climate science.","Hello! I'm Kris Karnauskas, faculty member at the University of Colorado Boulder's (http://www.colorado.edu) Department of Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences (http://www.colorado.edu/atoc/) and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (http://cires.colorado.edu/). I’m also an editor of AGU's Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans (http://tinyurl.com/ztaob5k). I lead the Oceans & Climate Lab (http://www.colorado.edu/oclab/), which aims to understand what makes the climate system tick, the role of the ocean in climate, and what are the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and human society. My team just published a study about some ongoing changes in the Pacific Ocean near the equator (http://tinyurl.com/gohynr9), and what they mean for penguins hanging in the balance. With one of the strongest El Nino events in recorded history peaking just last month, it has been an incredibly exciting year to be an oceanographer and climate scientist!

Talk to you soon!

"4bm28u","science","scientific","PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit, my name is Wan Yang, and I developed a forecast system that predicted the timing and magnitude of flu epidemics in Hong Kong -- Ask Me Anything!","Hi Reddit,


My name is [Wan Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/wanyangblog/), and I am an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University’s [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). I use mathematical and statistical methods to study how infectious diseases (e.g. influenza and Ebola) spread through populations and develop methods to predict them.


My colleagues and I published a paper, [""Forecasting Influenza Epidemics in Hong Kong""](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004383) in the journal [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/). Hong Kong has a humid subtropical climate and is a known global epicenter for flu. Unlike the U.S., where flu is seasonal, the timing of flu outbreaks in Hong Kong and similar climates is highly irregular—making prediction particularly challenging. Using data from 1998 to 2013, we developed two forecast systems for Hong Kong. We were able to predict the timing and magnitude of flu epidemics and the 2009 pandemic with accuracy near that achieved for the U.S.<http://cpid.iri.columbia.edu/> Our findings suggest that forecast of irregular infectious disease epidemics (e.g. the flu epidemics in Hong Kong) is possible.


I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET, AMA!

EDIT: Hello, everyone! I'm gonna start answering questions now :)

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great questions!  I had a great time answering them.  Now I'm signing off.

I am Ray Garant and am the director of public policy at the American Chemical Society.  Ask me anything about environmental and regulatory policy, advancing innovation, science education, and/or energy/climate policy.


I manage policy development and messaging for the ACS with a portfolio that spans scientific innovation, jobs, education, and science policy, as well as the international, environmental and regulatory arenas.  I also oversee the ACS Science & the Congress Project (www.acs.org/scicon), a well-respected program of congressional staff briefings and that improve decision makers’ understandings of the role that science can and should play in public policy.  
From 1993 - 1994 I was a staffer in the office of (now former) Representative Phil Sharp (D-IN).  While on the Hill, I followed environmental, judicial and healthcare issues.  


I studied chemistry in university, getting a B.S. at U Mass-Dartmouth and an M.S. at Iowa State University; at ISU I managed a project to communicate science to the public. I also did research at the Ames Laboratory of the Department of Energy and at the U.S. Naval Underwater Systems Center.
