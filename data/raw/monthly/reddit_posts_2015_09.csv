"3l17ff","science","scientific","American Chemical Society AMA: Hi! I’m Peter Mahaffy, Chem Professor and co-director of the King’s Centre for Visualization in Science. I’m here to discuss the crucial role for chemistry in addressing climate change challenges, Ask me Anything!","Hello Reddit! I co-direct the [King’s Centre for Visualization in Science](http://www.kcvs.ca) and am professor of chemistry at the [King’s University](http://www.kingsu.ca) in Edmonton, Canada. I’m the past-chair of the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry’s (IUPAC) Committee on Chemistry Education and served on the American Chemical Society Presidential Climate Science Working group.

Climate change is a defining challenge of the 21st Century – we’ve got to tackle this with all the scientific tools and imagination we have! Key stakeholders are in our chemistry classrooms right now, so both chemistry education and public awareness have important roles to play. In recent work on the planetary boundary framework that defines a safe operating space for humanity, climate change has been identified (Steffen, Rockström, et al, Science Feb 13, 2015) as one of only two core planetary boundaries with the potential on its own to drive the earth system into a new state, should the boundary be substantially and persistently exceeded. Much of the science underlying earth’s climate relies heavily on measurements and insights from the molecular sciences - so there are compelling reasons for the profession of chemistry to contribute to public understanding of the basic science and the challenges. Sustainable and green chemistry have crucial roles to play in working toward solutions. Did (or do) you experience these connections in the chemistry courses you took?

Check out three resources as you explore how fundamental understanding of chemistry relates to climate change challenges and solutions.
[Explainingclimatechange.com](http://www.explainingclimatechange.com) - An IUPAC legacy project for the International Year of Chemistry to provide a set of critically reviewed, interactive, web-based learning tools to help students, teachers, science professionals and the general public make sense of the underlying science of climate change. 
Visualizing the Chemistry of Climate Change (http://www.vc3chem.com and http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/sc500415k) - A recent project from our group in collaboration with colleagues at Purdue University and the American Chemical Society to create resources for learning general chemistry through the rich context of climate science.  
[ACS Climate Science Toolkit](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience.html) introduces the science of climate change to chemists.
I will be back at 11 am ET. Please AMA about the role for chemistry in addressing climate change challenges and in contributing green & sustainable chemistry solutions. I’m also very interested in discussing how chemistry education can empower the next generation of scientists and citizens to address these issues, and make chemistry more motivating and interesting at the same time.

Hi, I see some really interesting and important questions have been coming in. I’m live now and will start tackling them.  I’m delighted to be joined today by a group of 3rd and 4th year undergraduate chemistry students who have been studying green chemistry, and by Dr. Jerry Bell, who chaired the talented ACS Presidential Climate Science Working Group that created the ACS toolkit. Ask away!

EDIT: It's 2:10 pm ET.  Fabulous questions and discussion, everyone - we've done our best to get to questions, and there are lots more great ones out there.  I'm leaving to teach, but will do my best to come back to this in a couple hours and pick up some more threads and offer comments. Dr. Bell is able to keep answering for another half hour or so.  Thanks!  Peter 

EDIT:  5:20 pm ET Back for a bit and will get back to some more questions for another hour or so - keep them coming!  Peter 

Edit:  7:40 pm ET.  Needing to sign off now for the day.  Dr. Jerry Bell and I, along with the King's University chemistry students who joined in, would like to thank all of your for your stimulating questions and insightful discussion today.  We are heartened to see the interest this community has in exploring how to use the tools of chemistry both to understand some of the big challenges we face as a planet, and also the creative ways we can work with others toward solutions.  Keep these conversations going in your own institutional and community contexts!

"3lajil","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I'm Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central who launched WXshift this week. Ask me anything about climate change, how it's affecting your weather!","Hi everyone, I'm the chief meteorologist for [WXshift](http://wxshift.com/) and Climate Central. I also run our National Science Foundation-funded program with that provides climate information to more than 250 on-air TV meteorologists. In previous lives, I was a meteorologist for Accuweather and on TV in Baltimore. I'm a proud Penn State alum (We are...!) and card-carrying weather geek.

I'm part of a team that just launched WXshift, a new weather site, this week. It offers something no other weather site has — relevant, localized trends in rainfall, snowfall, temperatures and drought in the context of your daily forecast. We couldn't be more excited about it and I would love to answer your questions about the site, how we crunched data from 2,000 weather stations, local (or global) climate change, weather or any other burning meteorology questions you have. 

I've brought along a few friends to join, too. Brian Kahn, a senior science writer here at Climate Central, Eric Holthaus, a writer at Slate and fellow meteorologist, and Deke Arndt, the head of climate monitoring at the National Centers for Environmental Information, are here to chat, too.

We'll be back at 2 pm ET (11 am PT, 6 pm UTC) to answer questions, ask us anything!

EDIT: Hey Reddit, [Bernadette](https://twitter.com/bernadettewoods) and [Brian](https://twitter.com/blkahn) here! It's 2 p.m. ET, and we're officially jumping in to answer your questions along with [Deke](https://twitter.com/dekearndt) and [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericholthaus). Look forward to chatting!

EDIT #2:
Hello everyone! Just wanted to send out a HUGE thank you to all of your for participating and for all of your questions. We are really sorry that we can't answer each and every one of them, but we tried to cover as much as we could today before signing out. Also, a BIG thanks to the other members of this AMA Deke and Eric. Until next time...
Bernadette and Brian
