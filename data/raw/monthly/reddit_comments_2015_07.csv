Are any specific types of oceanic aerosols you've worked with correlated to a greater localized atmospheric temperature relative to their layer concentration in the atmosphere?

Beyond simple human industrial pollution (and I know it's anything but!) does the regional ground cover have a noticeable affect on the dispersion of naturally occurring aerosols?  Does it actually have an affect on industrial pollution as well?

Do you consider warming of the ocean to provide an addition of oceanic originating aerosols due to increased evaporation, or do you think that it is balanced or negated by decreasing wind (relative to lower atmospheric temperature difference) and less wave action/surface exposure?","2015-07-28 12:39:01","37","foxhunter","1747601145.8987489","climate science","scientific"

My first question is with regard to aerosols. The leveling off in global surface air temperatures between the 40s and 70s, and the subsequent rapid acceleration, is often attributed to industrially sourced aerosol pollution and then the clean air act respectively. We are now seeing China rapidly clean up it's act and reduce pollution levels. Might we see a substantial acceleration in global temperatures rise over the next few decades as a result?

On science communication, there has probably never been as big a battle between the scientific reality and corporate interests as we see now over climate change, with many myths and anti-climate change/science propaganda so pervasive within the public debate.

"ctizjks","t3_3evxgv","3evxgv","science","scientific","I have heard before that the net effect of increased water in the atmosphere is the biggest source of uncertainty in climate models, but this is the first time I've heard that it's the relationship between clouds and aerosols. I attributed it to how much water will remain as invisible vapor versus how much will form into clouds since the former is a purely positive forcing while clouds contribute to albedo. 

Can you give us some idea of the contribution to the uncertainty of these two (amount of cloud formation versus interaction of clouds with aerosols)? I'm sure these two sources of uncertainty are related, ie because cloud seeding may reduce cloud cover, but they seem distinct enough to be separated out. I'm okay with answers in W/m^2 but degrees C by some year would obviously be more widely accessible.

What's the latest, greatest research on global albedo changes? Has net albedo changed on a global level? 

Are you optimistic about the Paris climate talks? Shouldn't we be talking about carbon budgets rather than percent cuts from/by whatever years? Regardless of what that budget might be, how do you think the remaining carbon budget should be divided? Should historical emissions play a role? Should we just divide the remainder in a per capita way?

Is it likely our efforts will include plans to not destroy the planet as we have tried so valiantly to do here on Earth?

Second, how do you think human lift will be governed on Mars? Current governments, new governments, or run by whoever pays for the endeavors? How would you like to see things run?

And third, what aspect of your work do you find most exciting and/or fulfilling?

But my back-of-the-envelope calculations show that Mars could never hold a thick enough atmosphere for us to move around freely on the surface - even with a pure O2 mask, ambient would be below the Armstrong limit, unless we dug a crator several dozen kilometers deep to make the atmosphere artificially thick.

Can you provide some linkage between these two different ares of inquiry? How do spiders, swiss cheese  terrain and the fans identified in the South Polar region affect the dynamics of planetary scale climate on Mars?  

In some quarters, there has been suggestion that Mars continues to have an evolutionary climate, with some planetary features dated to less than 1 million years old. What factors could be driving climate change on Mars? On the Earth, Milankovitch Cycles  caused by variations in rotational inclination, procession of the pole and eccentricity of the orbit change the amount of sun the Earth gets at critical latitudes and drive the amount of ice/snow melt and eventually ice ages. Presumably Mars has similar cycles. Where is it in its own Milankovitch cycle right now? Is it about as warm as it gets;   Or could you expect a warmer climate as the various factors on Mars change over time?","2015-07-17 15:58:57","2","shiningPate","1747601165.6996439","climate science","scientific"
