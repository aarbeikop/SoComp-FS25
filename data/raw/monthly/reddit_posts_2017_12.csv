"7kcznk","collapse","skeptical","Ten years ago the UN's climate change panel said emissions must peak and CO2 stabilise at 400 ppm by 2015 to keep the temperature rise under 2.4°C. We've blown past both measures.","As the debate on climate change continues to be framed around what we need to do to keep the temperature increase below 2 degrees, I thought I'd put out a reminder of what [the agreed science, on the basis of 2,500 scientists](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains5-4.html), said ten years ago about where we needed to be now to have a chance of avoiding 2 degrees. Rather than peaking 2 years ago, [emissions reached an all-time high this year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/11/13/fossil-fuel-emissions-projected-to-reach-an-all-time-high-in-2017-dashing-hopes-of-progress/), and CO2 is hovering around 407 parts per million, having broken through [410 ppm at its peak back in April](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-just-breached-the-410-ppm-threshold-for-co2/).

The 2007 report was also the last one before the UN IPCC started basing future scenarios on fantasy technologies, primarily negative emissions technologies such as CO2 removal. A recent article [explained that the optimistic scenarios the UN now references all incorporate these technologies, within years, at scale](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-secret-of-the-worlds-plan-to-avert-climate-disaster/). But it’s not happening. 

It’s also worth remembering that in 2015, the year we were supposed to stabilise for 2 degrees but blew straight past, the politicians in Paris decided on a 1.5 degree goal that, on the basis of the science standing behind that goal, seems literally impossible. Which indicates that Paris was a success for collective cognitive dissonance if nothing else.","2017-12-17 09:33:31","88","32","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/7kcznk/ten_years_ago_the_uns_climate_change_panel_said/","True","veraknow","1747678535.577028","IPCC report","scientific"
