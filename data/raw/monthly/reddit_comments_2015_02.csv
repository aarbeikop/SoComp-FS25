I have two questions:

1.  Why is climate change affecting the Arctic more severely than other parts of the world?  And what aspect of human activity in your opinion is driving these changes the most in the Arctic (transportation, industry, etc...)?

2.  What lesser-known species (besides Polar Bears) are most at risk in the Arctic due to climate change?

Firstly, with evidence growing of Arctic Amplification altering the polar jet stream and, in turn, changing mid latitude weather pattern, is this new area of research becoming more of a focus within NOAA? Related to that, do you find the tendency of the media (occasionally supported by some scientists) to quickly try and relate every weather event to climate change and AA to be a problem when trying to get across the actual science to the general public?

Secondly, with regard to native populations within the high Arctic, how much are the changes that have already happened impacting their lives and livelihoods, and how much worse could it get within the next few decades?

Finally, could you describe some of the uses your team will be making of (if any) ESA's new sentinel satellites and how they may help with monitoring of the Arctic environment over the coming decades?

"coj6e60","t3_2vn8fp","2vn8fp","science","scientific","Hi Dr. Crane. This is a wonderful AMA series. Thanks for taking part! A question:

This may be directed to Greenland and the Antarctic, but as climate change occurs and warming happens, we see continental, land-locked ice melt. Could this have a positive, scientific effect on the mapping of underwater features? 

For example, a rapid influx of sediment could not only produce turbidity flows that could be monitored, but the ever more elusive hyperpycnal flow. As sedimentation increases, and more attention is drawn to these areas, could the bathymetry be monitored more closely to see the development of contourite deposits?

I know that climate change is a real problem,  and a devastating one at that, but there has to be some positive outcomes we can use to further scientific understanding.

I personally think arthropods are really useful in determining animal responses to climate change since they're so plentiful, reproduce often, and don't require IACUC approval.","2015-02-06 18:51:00","2","Hindu_Wardrobe","1747596580.465835","climate science","scientific"

"cod42rx","t3_2uz888","2uz888","science","scientific","I know that the wetlands have historically provided important barriers to flooding during extreme weather events. Due to the destruction of many important wetland areas and an increase in impermeable surfaces, these floods have increased significantly. How severe do you think that the floods can get, particularly if wetlands are further damaged along coastal areas where significant sea level rise is also predicted to occur in coming years?","2015-02-06 15:29:46","1","monsterman3000","1747596580.469186","climate science","scientific"

Ive always been interested as to how ecologists handle the problem of scale, especially when attempting to tie in large scale events (climate change) to smaller scale processes (community dynamics, hydrology).","2015-02-06 15:50:28","1","[deleted]","1747596580.4702668","climate science","scientific"
"cod4y3k","t3_2uz888","2uz888","science","scientific","First off, this project is incredibly cool! I noticed you're using the Hobo loggers to monitor the hydrology but how are you collecting the data on amphibians in situ? How do you plan to work around the fact that a lot of amphibians burrow in mud, making it hard to see them? 

Also any advice for a marine and freshwater biology undergrad student in her final year deciding what to do? I'm really interested in conservation biology and ecology so any advice is appreciated! ","2015-02-06 15:56:36","1","[deleted]","1747596580.471255","climate science","scientific"
