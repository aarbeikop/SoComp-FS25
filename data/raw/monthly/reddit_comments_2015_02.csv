"cotd7ac","t3_2wqkt2","2wqkt2","climatechange","action-oriented","Alright,  after a quick look through the article and I can see:

> The average temperature of the Earth has varied within a range of about 3°C during the past 3,000 years

We can take a quick look at the temperature record for the last [10k years on wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene#mediaviewer/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png) and you can see it hasn't varied by anywhere near 3C in the last 3000 years.

So warming at the moment is at about .8C above pre-industrial times.  If you start by assuming that 3C is natural variation, then .8C will seem natural.

[Skeptical Science](https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php) is always good for a look, it tackles many climate change myths

Every single academy of science and institute of higher education in the world disagrees with you and you can't find one and post one that does, and yet you haven't learned that.
The most intelligent people in the world do not agree with you. Please post the names of highly intelligent people that agree with you. People like Bill Gates, Sir Richard Branson, Niel DeGrasse Tyson, Steven Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku, etc. etc. disagree with and yet you haven't learned that.
Many of the largest institutions in the world disagree with you such as NASA, NOAA, The CIA, The FBI, The US Military, The UN, Shell Oil, BP, and the following linked list as well.

Isn't it funny that the ""alarmists"" are many of the most highly educated and intelligent people on the planet.

"cotervl","t3_2wqkt2","2wqkt2","climatechange","action-oriented","There's nothing wrong with it per se, though it's fairly incomplete and leaves out a lot both supporting and dispelling the AGW theory.

Do more research.  You've got a good spot to start, but there's more out there.  Look at solid sites like iceagenow.info and climatedepot.com....they'll be a good balance against the highly biased (and Soros-paid for) sites like Skeptical Science.

Good luck.","2015-02-22 14:17:21","-1","TheFerretman","1747654227.754","IPCC report","scientific"
"cotdwv2","t3_2wqkt2","2wqkt2","climatechange","action-oriented","There's nothing at all wrong with the content of the article. As you go over the various arguments pro and con AGW you'll find that AGW skeptics base their case on what we know rather than on what we speculate. AGW believers on the other hand base their case on the reverse. In order to create their case they've decided that (depending on the presenter and the question) natural climate cycles have not occured at all or that they were regional in nature. The latter case is even more problematic than the former given that the current AGW hypothesis insists that small changes ampify through feedbacks. How then do they justify believing that a local change in climate lasting hundreds of years can have no effect on the globe? AGW is built on contradictions and denial of previous observations. 

We know that throughout the period we can measure with some accuracy that global temperatures have cycled between warm and cool periods. A cool period ended at or about 1850 and so a warming period had to ensue regardless of whether there had been any industrial output by humans.
