I wonder, though, why we haven't seen an exodus out of the city. Even if Cape Town recovers this winter, what measures are in place to guard against future water shortages? Why are people staying, given the unsure futures of the aquifers and reservoirs?","2018-03-26 12:30:36","2","brandonsmash","1747631288.8583832","climate science","scientific"

I have two questions from an economic viewpoint.

Is it true that our water pipes have an above average water retention rate, only losing around 15% in total when pumping water from dams to residential areas?

How do they compare to other parts of South Africa and the world?
