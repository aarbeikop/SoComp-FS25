"e0xahf","collapse","skeptical","It´s 2019, thirty years after the first international climate conference and we´re still on track for four degree celsius","Thirty years ago the first climate conference was held in the Netherlands, in Noordwijk. Governments came within a hair of making binding commitments to reduce their emissions. The Americans however sent Sununu to keep track of their own representative at the conference. It became clear eventually that no binding commitments would be made.

The fossil fuel industry was spooked however and began a massive lobbying and disinformation campaign, intended to convince the American public and its representatives that you can simply use the atmosphere as a waste dump and expect no consequences to follow. This led to two presidents who walked away from Kyoto and the Paris accords and no genuinely binding commitments have been made since.

Progressives were kept sedated with promises of a bright green future where electricity would be renewable and cars would run on electricity, but in the absence of binding commitments, these new technologies merely serve to supplement our energy budget, rather than displacing fossil fuels. When people switched to new SUV´s, the rise in oil consumption entirely offset all the entire rise in electric vehicles. Yet, we´re supposed to believe that these new technologies will solve our problem for us.

The consequence is that even today, according to experts we are still on track for [more than four degree Celsius of global warming:](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/world-fossil-fuel-production-rise-guarantees-missing-paris-climate-goals/)

>Carbon emissions from fossil fuel use totaled 37.1 billion tonnes in 2018, a new record. Substantially reducing those emissions will never happen without reducing fossil fuel production, says Michael Lazarus, a lead author of “The Production Gap Report” and the director of Stockholm Environment Institute’s U.S. Center.

&#x200B;

>Using publicly-available government documents, the report found that countries’ plans to increase production of coal, oil, and gas amounts to 120 percent more in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to 2.7 degrees F. Those plans include producing 280 percent more coal. That puts the world on a path to more than 7.2 degrees F (4 degrees C) of warming, says Lazarus.

Keep in mind that four degree Celsius globally tends to mean [around six degree](https://archive.ipcc.ch/report/graphics/images/Assessment%20Reports/AR5%20-%20WG1/SPM/FigSPM-08.jpg) on land, because the land warms more than the ocean.

There is nowhere to flee to. If you flee to Siberia, Alaska or Northern Canada, you´re probably worse off, because the warming there is much more intense than elsewhere. The permafrost will face [abrupt thaw](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0614-6), from one year to the next. This leads to infrastructural collapse, drought and a sudden temperature jump in these places, resulting in massive unprecedented forest fires.

At 410 parts per million, the planet should have already warmed far more than it actually has, but some of this warming is hidden from us by toxic air pollution. Please keep in mind that the IPCC projections don´t properly take all of the feedback loops into consideration that come into play. Freshwater lake bacteria will start producing methane, bacteria in oceanic dead zones start releasing nitrous oxide, the decaying permafrost releases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

We have in fact already reached dangerous levels of warming. It´s not a mystery that we´re facing unprecedented forest fires around the world, this is exactly what we should have expected. Before the IPCC, we had the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases. The Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases wrote:

“…[B]eyond 1 degree C may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damage.”

The reason the world settled on a two degree target is because of an economist, Nordhaus, who assumed through simplistic economic simulations that the world could handle some global warming without harm to the global economy. These economic simulations are vast simplifications that don´t take ecosystem damage into proper consideration. Nordhaus for example arrives at 8.5% GDP reduction for six degree of global warming. And to illustrate how truly ridiculous their projections really are, consider what [Skeptical Science](https://skepticalscience.com/climate-costs-often-underestimated.html) notes about these economic reports:

>A 2010 paper led by the late economist Frank Ackerman found that not until global warming reached 19 degrees C (34 degrees F – a global temperature that is virtually incompatible with life) did the model yield a 50% reduction in economic output.

With projections like this, that policymakers are indirectly exposed to, it´s easy to pretend that no real action needs to be taken. So what the world governments have settled on as a consequence is a trajectory that will mean the end of civilization as we know it and a global mass extinction.

Keep in mind that there are people who knew what was coming. The existence of the problem has been known since the late 19th century and the American Petroleum Institute was explicitly warned as early as 1959. The big fossil fuel companies knew this would be a problem long before the 1989 conference in Naaldwijk. They had plenty of time to react, that´s how we ended up with a massive disinformation campaign.

The big oil companies knew what would happen and even to this day, companies like Shell are still making projections about how the future will look according to them. All their scenarios overshoot two degree of global warming, the IPCC, the Paris accords, all of these attempts at reigning in global warming are just a big joke to these people. 

You can see their scenarios for yourself [here](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/new-lenses-on-the-future/_jcr_content/par/relatedtopics.stream/1519787235340/77705819dcc8c77394d9540947e811b8c35bda83/scenarios-newdoc-english.pdf). My younger brother once applied for a job with Shell, they had him do some standard personality tests and told him it´s not going to work because he has a moral compass. That´s what these organizations do, they screen applicants to make sure they only hire self-absorbed greedy people without a soul.

In a sane world there would be a Nuremberg tribunal, where people like the Shell directors would be thrown in jail. They have advertisements everywhere marketing green energy, but keep in mind what the real purpose is. It´s lipstick on a pig. They show you their green bullshit, while they openly plan on overshooting two degree Celsius behind the scenes.

Nobody is brave enough to hold these people truly accountable. They annihilated the only planet we know of with life, but they are met with signs and slogans. Try to imagine this is Independence Day and the aliens have made it clear that they will extract our planet´s natural resources and kill us all, but people react by holding up signs and slogans. Try to imagine you are living in the Warsaw ghetto in april 1943 and the people there declare that they are going to engage in civil disobedience against the Nazi´s. The trains are riding and the people are responding by laying down on the tracks until the police escort them. That´s the situation we´re dealing with.

Please understand and acknowledge the following: We are completely delusional and out of touch with reality. William Wilberforce did not understand slavery and Henry David Thoreau did not understand slavery. For them it is an intellectual abstraction in their heads. [Celia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Missouri_v._Celia,_a_Slave) understood slavery, because she lived it. We don´t understand climate change, because we live in concrete cities where we are kept alive by industrial agriculture. The people who understand climate change are the indigenous people who live in the Amazon rainforest, or the farmers in India who commit suicide. To us it is an intellectual abstraction, so we act as if it is an intellectual abstraction.

Do with that knowledge what you want.","2019-11-24 11:16:42","923","183","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/e0xahf/its_2019_thirty_years_after_the_first/","True","mushroomsarebuddies","1747652307.283325","climate science","scientific"
