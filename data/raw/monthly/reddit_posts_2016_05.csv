I've seen a lot of blather about how a path to extinction isn't included in the package of economic desolation and environmental devastation we find ourselves unwrapping lately. How the human species has survived climate change before, how hunter gatherers can survive in isolated environments for centuries, how we may have a dieoff, but extinction is unthinkable.

I think that shows a stunning lack of imagination.

I want to go on a brief journey though some of the unknown factors we're facing as we reap the results of tossing [billions of tons of carbon dioxide](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/carbon-dioxide-earths-hottest-topic-just-warming) into the atmosphere every year. It's really easy to look at the projected sea level rises, the projected air and sea temperature rises, the increasing acidification of the oceans, and be convinced that we have a grasp of what we're up against. It looks, from our perspective here in 2016, like a bunch of smooth curves that we'll be climbing into some unimaginably hellish, but ultimately survivable future.

Instead, I think we're about to be surprised by the consequences of environmental disequilibrium. We're increasing the odds of a whole lot of bad things happening, and some of them we can't even begin to predict. Let's take a look at a few that we can.

The obvious one is the blue ocean event. This one is fun because we know it's going to happen, we just don't know when. The [US Navy](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/dec/09/us-navy-arctic-sea-ice-2016-melt) predicted it for this summer back in [2013](http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/article_f0d1fc46-56dc-11e3-9766-001a4bcf6878.html), and that's [not out of the question](https://robertscribbler.com/tag/blue-ocean-event/). So, what will it mean?

We're not sure. [We know](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/arctic-sea-ice-loss-implications/) it will include a lot more sunlight absorbed by the newly lowered albedo, resulting in warmer waters around the arctic, increasing storm frequency and strength. Oh, and the jet stream will weaken with the decreased global temperature gradient. It'll speed the melting of Greenland, which [may proceed unpredictably](http://www.rollingstone.com/feature/greenland-melting).

That's going to accelerate subsea permafrost melt in the Arctic. I'm not going to go deep into the implications of that [when it comes to methane](http://meetings.copernicus.org/www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/01526/EGU2008-A-01526.pdf), but suffice it to say that if the 1500 gigatons of methane clathrates under the East Siberian Sea decide to let out a burp, it could be bad. Because we currently have just 5 gigatons of methane in the entire atmosphere. Oh, and the ESS is tectonically unstable.

Even without earthquakes, the melting of the Arctic ice creates a whole new Arctic hazard; [tsunamis](https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic/articles/2016/03/25/the-icy-fire-beneath-norways-seabed). Imagine if you will what the effects of a big chunk of continental shelf letting go would be, [right in the middle](http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2014/06/earthquakes-and-warm-water-threaten-arctic.html) of the most sensitive environment on the planet.

So, to sum up the Arctic portion of my diatribe, we're about to see what happens when we have a major change in our climate state. We have no idea what the climate will do once we lose the Arctic ice, or how long it will take, but there's [considerable evidence](https://agwobserver.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/papers-on-ecosystem-response-to-past-climate/) that the climate has changed very quickly in the past. Sometimes in [as little as a year](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ice-core-reveals-how-quickly-climate-can-change/). And we don't know what it's changing into.

Now, all of these changes are being caused by the stuff we're pumping into the atmosphere; the gaseous detritus of human civilization. But I'm not convinced that we understand the full implications of those emissions yet. After all, it was just a few years ago that we figured out that [leaded gasoline led to crime waves](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health). Who knows what other gases that we're soaking in have unanticipated consequences? We've got toxic [firefighting foam](https://theintercept.com/2015/12/16/toxic-firefighting-foam-has-contaminated-u-s-drinking-water-with-pfcs/) invading our water supplies, the stuff used in making [teflon](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid--pfoa) is an omnipresent cancer risk. What else are we missing?

Well, how about the long-term health effects of increased carbon dioxide. It's gone from around 300ppm to 400 ppm in a human lifetime. We know it's keeping trees [from cooling the planet](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100503161435.htm), it's [devastating marine life](http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2007/01/), it's [encouraging the spread of pests](http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/impacts/Global-warming-insects.html#.V0kNOuSWOAA). What's it going to do to us?

Well, we don't know. The most obvious effect will be that even in the best parts of the planet, [you'll be living in the equivalent of a stuffy office](http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/jun252006/1607.pdf), so headaches, general malaise, dizziness, that sort of thing. Other current health effects include [making us stupid](http://www.skepticalscience.com/how-sapiens-in-the-world-of-high-co2-concentration.html) and possibly [fat](https://thesenecaeffect.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/the-effects-of-elevated-carbon-dioxide-on-our-health/).  But long-term exposure causes respiratory acidosis, and we don't know what effects that has over the course of years or decades.[This paper](http://grapevine.com.au/~pbierwirth/co2toxicity.pdf) sums it up nicely.

It's pretty easy to think of a post-collapse future and envision bands of hardy hunter-gatherers, bravely ekeing out a living once civilization has fallen. After all, we've been through periods of climate change before as a species.

We have, but not really well. It looks like there was a period of time where we were down to around 2,000 individuals for [a few thousand years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck). Once you're down that low, survival is a question of luck, and I don't really want to roll the dice on that one twice.

Our hardy band of hunter-gatherers is going to be up against an increase in agricultural pests, an increase in heat, an increase in catastrophic weather events, an increase in diseases, a decrease in food output, a decrease in available potable water, the lingering effects of environmental toxins, and the unknown aftereffects of the decline of civilization. And they're going to have to do it while dealing with severely curtailed brainpower due to increased CO2.

Yes, the human race is adaptable. Yes, we're intelligent. Yes, we've survived a lot so far.

But it's easy to see where we're stacking the deck against the survival of the species. I haven't even gone into the effects of the massive wave of extinctions we're dealing with, or the possibility that as things wind down we'll see the nukes deployed. Hell, I didn't even touch on global dimming.

The damage from all of this is cumulative. Just because we understand some aspects of all of these systems doesn't mean we can predict what happens when we break all of them at once. We have no precedent on which to base predictions of what happens when we put this much carbon and pollutants into the atmosphere of a planet in a short period of time; we can only make educated guesses, and hope for the best.

So if you find yourself reassured by the smooth curves on the IPCC reports and the hubris that we're too smart to be wiped out, please consider the possibility that you've massively underestimated the scope of the problems we're facing.
