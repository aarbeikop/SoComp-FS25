According to the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, this is a ""9b"" growing zone, but according to my own measurements over the last 5 years, I treat my garden as a 10a zone, and plant accordingly.

From what I can tell, 20 years ago this area would have rated solidly in the 9a growing zone range.

My questions:

1. The last zone map was updated in 2012.  Is your work going to be considered by the USDA in order to update their hardiness zone map?
1. In what ways do you think this map will change in 10, 20, and 50 years?
1. Are farmers reacting to climate change by relocating their crops to more suitable zones?

I'm an early career ocean-atmosphere scientist (just started a postdoc last September at COLA in ENSO research!) and had a couple of field and career related questions.

Career Q:
Obviously networking and publishing are two of the most important things to an early career scientist. What other things can an ECS do to attract notoriety and improve their chances at landing a job within the field? On that note, was there a sort of a-ha moment that pushed you toward a tenure-track position vs. an industry position?

Science Q: 
I'm currently working with CESM, and was wondering what your opinion is on state of the art coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. What shortcomings do they have? Where should we be focusing our efforts on improving them?

Personal Q:
Did Dr. Busalacchi ever give you any good stories about his PhD advisor, JJO? Jim's a real hoot.

During EN Modoki conditions, the warm surface water is in the central Pacific rather than the eastern Pacific like EN's, & during LN Modoki conditions, it's in both the eastern & western Pacific rather than just the west like typical LN's.

They say this is important because the worst tropical cyclones in the northwestern Pacific (""typhoons"") occur during El Niño Modoki conditions, with ""regular"" El Niño conditions second. Do you think they're onto something? Will our classification of the ENSO get more complicated?

It seems that such facilities are becoming dinosaurs (like my Atari 2600), and are just not getting the funding they used to have.

I was just in Hong Kong less than a week ago, sure it is cold there! Anyways, speaking of disease control, we (I come from Singapore) have experienced disease outbreaks of large scale due to our shared hot and sometimes wet climate, like the SARS outbreak back in 2003.

Is there a possibility that culture plays a key role in disease transmission? Even in the modern world, we do keep traditions like sanitizing plates in Hong Kong at the table using hot water, when we drink we sometimes share a cup, etc, and hence are causing an unpredictable spread of diseases, which makes modeling even tougher?

Also, Hong Kong and Singapore do share a high population density, living in apartment buildings. Do you see trends of infection where one building gets mostly infected, then it starts spreading to other buildings, and modeling across the different stories that people live on?

One last question, infectious disease control is of utmost importance and urgency to nations. Seeing different countries' response to the Ebola outbreak, what can we learn in terms of hospital segmentation and pre-screening at borders? How does your model cope with these capture zones?
