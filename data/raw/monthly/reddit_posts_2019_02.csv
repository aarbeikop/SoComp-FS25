"ar6wt3","climatechange","action-oriented","[Question] Is Climate Science actually controversial among climate scientists ?","Hi, first of all, I am a Climate Change believer, but that's part of the problem. I don't have the knowledge or means to verify the information. So I have a few questions - Is Climate Change actually controversial in the scientific circles ? Is the claim that 99.7% consensus on Climate Change is misleading true ?  Whenever I see a scientist speak about Climate Change in tv, it is usually someone not from the field, like NDT or Brian Cox or someone else. Why isn't actual climate scientists consulted for this ?   Thank you for all your responses 🙂","2019-02-16 08:23:52","7","21","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ar6wt3/question_is_climate_science_actually/","True","arrowbender","1747643388.5815308","climate science","scientific"
