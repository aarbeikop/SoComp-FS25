"c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented","What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?","I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

"c04ksi","science","scientific","Science Discussion: Technology gives us ways to change ourselves that offer great rewards but also huge risks. We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists who work on human augmentation. Let’s discuss!","[Hi Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png)! From tattoos and jewelry for expressing ourselves to clothing and fire to help us survive extreme climates, changing our bodies is something humans have always done. But recent technological and scientific advances have allowed us to take human augmentation to new levels. Gene editing, artificial limbs, medical advances, and artificial intelligence systems have all drastically changed the ways we think about what it means to be human. These technologies offer chances to open doors for people with disabilities and explore new frontiers. They advance possibilities for solving big problems like world hunger and health. But they also present new risks and serious ethical challenges.

# To help us discuss the potentials and perils of human augmentation, we have six scientists who are part of the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s [2019-2020 Leshner Leadership Institute Public Engagement Fellows](https://www.aaas.org/programs/center-public-engagement-science-and-technology/2019-2020-leshner-leadership-institute).

"c11bjp","collapse","skeptical","A collapse is coming, capitalism has destroyed the world. Can we take advantage of the fact we are cognizant of this?","Shit is going to get bad in the next 20 or 30 years, if not much sooner. Capitalism is without a doubt responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. It encourages the unsustainable exploitation of every natural resource on this planet, maximizing short  term profits over every other possible motivation. The fact you are reading this right now means you likely have come to a similar conclusion. 

We cannot change these facts. The end is already written for human society, at least as we know it. The vast majority of people in the world have their heads in the sand, willfully ignorant that society will all come crashing down much sooner than they expect. I think the only option we, as individuals cognizant of this, really have left at this point is to the exploit the existing system to our own benefit. 

At the top of my list is securing a place to live in an area of the world which will be minimally affected by climate change. I'm not sure where yet, I hope I still have a little time to research this topic thoroughly and make my plans. Another thing I have been considering is how various facets of the world economy will change as a result of climate change. What can I invest in now to allow me the means to  secure shelter, food, water and safety when shit really hits the fan? 

As climate change becomes more pronounced, growing enough food to feed the ever growing human population will become tougher and tougher. Global supply chains will break down, millions of people who depend on food being imported from halfway around the world will starve. Humans will turn to science to fill the gaps, crops genetically engineered to grow in inhospitable environments, meat grown in petri dishes in a lab, technology will not be our savior but it  may stave off the inevitable for a few years. Companies which offer this hope will make billions in the years before the collapse.  Can I leverage this fact to gain security for myself before everything falls apart? I studied biomedical engineering in school and got a job designing genetic sequencers for a living in the hope that I could. Other than these vague hunches, I have no fucking idea what is going to happen, what to do about it or why I wrote this post.","2019-06-15 19:47:50","614","417","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c11bjp/a_collapse_is_coming_capitalism_has_destroyed_the/","True","wataf","1747647645.051231","climate science","scientific"
