"47uhwf","collapse","skeptical","How I remember Climate Change","If you've been paying attention to the media reports on climate change for the past 10-20 years, you've probably noticed a very peculiar change in the narrative. John Michael Greer has touched upon this in [some of his blog posts](http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.nl/2015/12/too-little-too-late.html) a few weeks ago, but I figured it's worth pointing out here as well. To me it's starting to feel like I come from a different timeline that was merged into this timeline, because the entire narrative seems to have changed.

Back when I was in high school, the idea of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere wasn't there. Removing it was said to be impossible. Once it's in the atmosphere, we have to deal with it. Today, every major projection by the IPCC seems to feature this idea that we're somehow going to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Once it became necessary to meet the two degree target, it seems to have turned from something impossible in the minds of people into something we'll eventually figure out somehow.

This brings me to another issue, the fact that I remember the two degree target being paraded in the media very differently. The two degree target was difficult, sure, but it was necessary. We couldn't settle for a higher target, because once we move beyond two degree, feedbacks were supposed to kick in that take the change out of our control and ensure that the planet continues to change on its own trajectory, regardless of what we might do. 

There were all sorts of feedbacks we were told about that would start to kick in above 2 degree Celsius. The ocean would warm up and as a result of warming up it would start emitting CO2, rather than absorbing CO2. The arctic sea ice would melt and as a result, temperatures would increase further due to the albedo effect. The same things would happen to the tundra, where snow would melt and methane would be released from the permafrost due to thawing vegetation. Eventually, wildfires would kick in that would destroy our forests, released carbon from the burning trees and the soils, etcetera. 

Thus, the point that was always argued was that it's two degree or nothing. A higher target was irrelevant, because a higher target would merely buy us some time, as the feedbacks kick in and we're left with a very different world. But today, I regularly see news articles arguing to raise the target to [2.5 or 3 degree](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/climate-change-target-of-two-degrees-celsius-needs-revision-a-904219.html), or abandon a target altogether. Even in Nature, [we find prominent scientists calling for abandoning the 2 degree target.](http://www.nature.com/news/climate-policy-ditch-the-2-c-warming-goal-1.16018)

The entire narrative seems to have changed from one of man rolling a ball of snow down a snowy mountain, towards one of man carefully tuning the button on his thermostat. Meanwhile the apocalyptic predictions we were warned about are now here, but nobody is talking about them. Instead of all the people who warned about this stuff saying ""See, I told you so!"" like you might expect, they don't wish to talk about it anymore and these have now become fringe issues.

Massive wildfires in Indonesia destroy the remaining forests, but it's never really mentioned as being a consequence of climate change and a positive feedback, rather it's attributed solely to the locals who burn everything down and make their own cities uninhabitabl in the process. The [explosions in Siberia](http://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/climate-change/russian-scientist-warns-methane-explosions-a-threat-to-siberian-cities/news-story/1ba63cdafe5b365d48145116b02fae01) creating massive craters in the ground due to methane eruptions are not really discussed. Rapidly [growing spikes in atmospheric methane are detected](http://robertscribbler.com/2016/02/26/2-c-coming-on-faster-than-we-feared-atmospheric-methane-spikes-to-record-3000-parts-per-billion), but there's no real talk about this in the media, it's delegated to a number of fringe blogs and mainstream climatologists don't seem to want to touch it and there seems to be no official acknowledgement that this is even happening from them.
