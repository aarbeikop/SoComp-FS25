Another one is acid rain, we had methods to use to address the underlying issue, and I'm sure there was profit for some in the end as well.

That carbon that is already in the atmosphere continues to have an effect, and even if you invented a machine tomorrow that could suck it out of the atmosphere faster than it was put in there, you still have to build it - or rather, millions of them, and power them, and you're still looking at many decades or hundreds of years until it's stable again once you've started. In the mean-time, it will have passed 5 degrees heating, and our descendants will be living on a dust-bowl planet like *Dune* (if there are any left at all), reduced to a few hundred thousand people scraping a living off the land at the poles. We're basically turning this planet into a hot version of Mars.

Our desire to ""defer to the experts"" encouraged by the elite classes who want some excuse to be in charge is going to take us out. Humans are just apparently not able to understand and react to problems of this scale (large) that develop on a gradual basis over longer periods of time than a generation. In this case it may be a fatal flaw, since possible attempts to fix (along with failed efforts) are being delayed until the problem is so far along.

Our culture teaches us that the environment is only worthwhile if we can extract something from it that generates cash for somebody. We understand so little still about how natural systems work.

"emfbclf","t3_bk8x8h","bk8x8h","sustainability","action-oriented","Did a masters degree in sustainability, researched sustainability reporting at corporations, worked at a fortune 250 corporation in a sustainability team, currently research corporate sustainability. 

My colleagues all work in extraordinary wide variety of positions, and come from a diverse set of backgrounds. There is certainly no linear path to sustainability careers, but that also means there is no ""right or wrong"" way. 

My advice, pure ""sustainability"" jobs don't often exist. I'd recommend:

1) exploring what aspect of sustainability excites you the most? Climate Change? Water use? Gender equality? Ending poverty? Circular economy? Use the sustainable development goals as a guide. 


2) then explore what kind of industry excites you. Retail? Energy? Forestry? Transportation? 

After you have your answer to #1 and #2 try and start getting experience in that realm!

I picked climate change and the energy industry, and have found great success. When I worked in a corporate team, none of my co-workers had similar backgrounds. Engineers, computer science, geophysics, biologists, poli sci, communications. etc...while all different backgrounds, they brought unique experiences for certain sustainability-related issues that was useful. I was actually the only one with a sustainablility-specifc education in the 25 person team. 

Finally, chances are your definition of ""sustainable jobs"" is much to narrow. They come in all shapes and sizes, working on a wide variety of issues. Again, use the sustainable development goals as a roadmap to what is considered a sustainable issue.
