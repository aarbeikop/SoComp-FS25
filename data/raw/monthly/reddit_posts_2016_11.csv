"5byi0k","environment","emotional","Let's get Trump to accept climate change","Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.","2016-11-09 04:45:05","22228","924","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/","True","cam_man_can","1747616023.9744482","climate science","scientific"

I'm Ira Flatow. I'm the host and Executive Producer of [Science Friday](http://www.sciencefriday.com/), which you can hear on most public radio stations each Friday.

This year is the 25th anniversary of Science Friday and we have more listeners now than we've ever had. (Not to mention the biggest social media audience of any public radio news program.)

You may remember me from Newton's Apple, CBS This Morning, PBS’s Transistorized!, or my most recent book Present at the Future. I've also made appearances on The Big Bang Theory and Brain Dead. I’m the winner of numerous awards, most recently the Isaac Asimov Award.  

I love to talk about cosmology and the microbiome. And I’m concerned about the impact a Trump presidency will have on science. Ask me anything about science, technology, public radio, or what your favorite scientist is like.

**I’ll be back at noon EST (9 am PST, 5 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!**

EDIT: And we're live!

EDIT: Thanks! I really enjoyed chatting with you all today. I'll log on later (maybe tomorrow) to see if I can answer any more questions.","2016-11-16 12:22:24","6079","452","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5d8wdw/science_ama_series_im_ira_flatow_the_host_of/","True","Science_Friday","1747616242.271956","climate science","scientific"
"5aip84","science","scientific","American Chemical Society AMA: Hi! I am Amanda Morris, an Assistant Professor of Energy Chemistry at Virginia Tech. Ask me anything about how to make solar energy competitive!","Hi Reddit! My name is Amanda Morris and I am a Professor of Chemistry at Virginia Tech. I serve as an ACS Expert in the field of sustainable energy (https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/experts/amanda-morris.html).   This is my second AMA on this topic – you can see my biography and that session’s discussion via https://redd.it/3hfja5


Some of the questions people had last year concerned:


how does artificial photosynthesis work; 
how do the various semiconductor materials used in solar energy work;
how does the electrical grid design affect solar energy potentials; 
how does energy storage technology play a role with solar uptake?


I’m happy to answer more about these topics and any others that come to mind. Ask me anything about solar energy!


I will return at 11 am ET (8am PT, 3pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!

(10:50 EST) Hey y'all! I am signed on and replying! I am pumped to see so many comments already!

(1:00 EST) Great time answering your questions! The biggest themes were when is solar cost effective for me, solar cell recycling and life cycle analysis, and Tesla's solar relevant technologies. There are calculators to consider the first point - http://www.solar-estimate.org/ is just one example. First Solar is now recycling solar cell modules for large installations - great news! And, Tesla continues to push the envelope, but the cost effectiveness of such technoogies isn't proven yet.

Thanks all! Sorry, I didn't get to most of your questions! Until next time!

I am very interested in sustainable agriculture, organic farming and especially the Fukuoka Method of farming. I just don't know where to start looking and how to narrow down career choices. I am also interested in programs at universities and cater to this field. I have completed a 2 year transfer degree of science in the state of Oregon and currently live in Portland, Oregon.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask!
