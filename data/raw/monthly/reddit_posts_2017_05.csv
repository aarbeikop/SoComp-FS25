My name is Arslan Zaidi and I am a postdoctoral scholar at Penn State University. My broad research interests revolve around studying the ultimate (evolutionary) and proximate (developmental) causes of human variation.
 
My name is Mark Shriver and I am a professor of Anthropology at Penn State University. I am interested in studying the evolution of complex traits such as skin pigmentation and facial shape in humans, and in identifying the genetic determinants of these complex phenotypes.
 
We recently published a paper titled [“Investigating the Case of Human Nose Shape and Climate Adaptation”]( http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006616&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=ama&utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0503) in the March issue of [PLOS Genetics](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics). We were broadly interested in how and why facial shape has evolved in humans in our recent history and wanted to focus on one long-standing hypothesis: that differences in nose shape in humans have evolved due to adaptation to climate. We found support for two things: i) nostril width and nose width seem to be evolving faster across populations than expected under genetic drift alone (read: due to divergent selection), and ii) these differences may be driven, at least partly, by local adaptation to temperature and humidity

Hi Reddit! My name is Mallory Hinks. I recently defended my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Chemistry at University of California, Irvine. For the last 5 years as a graduate student, I have worked for Professor Sergey Nizkorodov (http://aerosol.chem.uci.edu/). My work has been focused on understanding the effects of environmental conditions on the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric aerosols and how they interact with sunlight in the atmosphere. If you want a little more background, here is a video about aerosols and my research to give you a basic overview: https://youtu.be/F-UW8oMiNng


While in graduate school, I developed a passion for science communication. I entered and won multiple science communication competitions including the UCI Grad Slam competition and the ACS ChemChamps competition. Following those experiences, I expanded my extracurricular activities to include more science communication opportunities. As a Science Communication Fellow for the Loh Down on Science radio show (http://www.lohdownonscience.org/), I wrote scripts for 90 second radio segments that aired on NPR. As a Communication Consultant for the UCI Graduate Resource Center, I advised students on their presentations in one-on-one meetings. I hope that I can help inspire scientists at all levels to develop an interest in science communication!
I’m looking forward to answering your questions about atmospheric chemistry, science communication or about life as a graduate student!


I will be back at 12:00p EDT (9a PDT, 4p UTC) to start answering your questions.

"69722h","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I’m Dr. Jeff Brawn, a University of Illinois ornithologist and conservation biologist. You may experience a heightened awareness of birds during these early weeks of spring—particularly at 4 a.m. when neighborhood chirping seems ridiculously loud. I study birds year round! AMA!","Hi reddit!

I’ve been fascinated by birds ever since taking a class in ornithology as an undergraduate. Now, as a professor and researcher at U of I, a lot of what I do is about bird populations and how they ""tick"" and how to conserve them. For example, in one project we tracked the role of robins in the spread of West Nile virus    (http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vbz.2007.0123). Although the primary culprit in spreading the virus is the common mosquito, robins are accomplices. They’re what we call ""super-amplifiers"" of the disease. Crows and jays just can't handle West Nile virus and they die when they get it, but robins do much better. They are a competent host of the disease. And, because robins are common in urban environments, they might be part of the smoking gun for why and where the disease is and isn't.
 
Since 1986, I’ve been involved in a project with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute studying bird populations in Panama’s Soberania National Park—approximately 100 square miles of protected rainforest. It’s also home to well over 500 bird species. Because we have over 30 years of data, we were able to study the effect of changing environmental conditions and its relationship to bird populations.
 
Because the tropics are relatively stable with milder seasonal change, tropical birds may not be able to handle environmental disturbances as easily, physiologically or behaviorally, as temperate-zone birds. Those Midwest birds who wake us up while it’s still dark are able to make it through below-zero winters and 100-degree summers—environmental stress that tropical birds never experience. Consequently, tropical ecosystems and animal populations may be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
 
Here’s a link to the full paper about the research that appeared in Nature Climate Change:
https://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v7/n2/full/nclimate3183.html
 
This article, Will climate change leave tropical birds hung out to dry?  includes a short video of me talking about why I think this research is so important.
