"d03hcgv","t3_46878n","46878n","science","scientific","I took away from this article that your reconstructed OMZ's indicate that OMZ's oscillate over long periods, and periods of warming create potential for OMZ's be much larger in extent until/if a new stable state is reached. Is that a fair elevator pitch for the implications of this work for the present and future under climate change?","2016-02-17 18:37:44","1","AFishInSchool","1747607892.916695","climate science","scientific"
"d03hsun","t3_46878n","46878n","science","scientific","Hi All - Just to add a little context about the research that Kate and I authored...we looked at marine sediment cores from the last deglaciation (i.e. the warming and ice-sheet melting that occurred from 18,000-10,000 years ago) to try and understand the spatial changes to subsurface oxygen zones that co-occurred during this most recent event of global-scale warming. The deglaciation is not an analog to what we are doing to the planet right now. You could consider it a pseudo-analog or an informative laboratory. This is because the deglaciation was fundamentally caused by the changing relationship between the earth and the sun - the orbital geometry, or Milankovitch Cycles, of how our planet moves around the sun (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles). What we found is this (in a nutshell): whole ocean basins lose oxygen in sync when the climate system warms. The spatial extent of this phenomena is particularly important, because this kind of physical and chemical change to our ocean completely dwarfs the way that we consider managing and conserving the global ocean right now. - Sarah","2016-02-17 18:47:52","1","PLOSScienceWednesday","1747607892.919043","climate science","scientific"

Is there a feedback mechanism where fertilization could result in both increased OMZs and decreased oceanic CO2 uptake/carbonate conversion?","2016-02-17 19:26:35","1","shiningPate","1747607892.920532","climate science","scientific"
