It kept enough of us--just enough--comfortable to perpetuate itself. Wrap the whole thing in denial and you've got yourself just another failed species. Universe is most likely littered with them.

We came to identify so strongly with our privilege that to believe--forget accept, half of us don't even *believe*--in our fate is unthinkable. Shit, half of us, maybe more, don't even think death is real.

We lost.

"d0fvj04","t3_47uhwf","47uhwf","collapse","skeptical","The tipping point for permafrost melt is supposed to be 1.5 degrees Celsius, but we probably have already passed that amount of warming in the permafrost zone. This means that we are already locked in for a very strong positive feedback in addition to albedo loss. China was building coal plants and Japan is exporting them. There does not seem much hope of keeping to 2 degrees warming. We will almost certainly hit 3 or 4 or 6 or more degrees. When we do, it will play havoc with ecosystems and weather systems. It will not be fun.

Basically, I guess that Big Business is fighting back because they do not want to lose their profit centers based on the current fossil fuel system. Things will continue on until they no longer can and then they will change or fail.

"d0fzpb4","t3_47uhwf","47uhwf","collapse","skeptical","Probably because of what almost seems like a right wing takeover of everything, including climate science and any kind of education on the subject. Even my 11th grade ecology teacher (as nice of a woman as she was) thinks that humans only play a small role in heating the planet up, rather than playing virtually a 100% role in making it heat up faster now than in any other time in Earth's history. 

It's almost like the Matrix. People don't want to wake up to a grim reality that faces them in the future, so those in charge continue to make it seem like we still have time left. For example, president Obama recently tried to push a budget for about $2 billion that would help combat climate change, and the GOP (as usual) rejected any kind of progress. Poor progress, but some sort of progress nonetheless. There's gonna be political deadlock until June, thus letting climate change heat up even more. We're running out of time, and we don't even give a shit. 

We're like a person who sees an ominous lump on their neck and all of the symptoms of cancer but refusing to do anything about it in hopes that it'll just go away. ","2016-02-27 18:20:59","15","hughsocash45","1747662438.181264","IPCC report","scientific"

Targets are forgotten when they are passed, then the scaremongering moves onto the next target. I'm talking about a lot of respected scientists here, and I question their motives. What I think those motives are about is conserving privilege in academic and political circles.

"d0goh27","t3_47uhwf","47uhwf","collapse","skeptical",">How did this happen?

People want to drive to work, use HVAC, fly for holidays, refuse to stop breeding like yeast and love buying 'stuff'....if I have one more friend comment they bought something becasue 'it was cheap', I'll go postal :) and more and more want to do this from countries all over the world  They are not prepared to give this úp.

It's no different to any other issue of this scale eg global poverty.  For example my backward ass'd Government, Australia, just found $200 Billion more to spend on the military... if we spent that on renewables, insulation, better housing, moving people away from sea level rise etc we'd be well on the way.  Ostensibly it's to fight terrorists I am not sure how 12 new Submarines will help in that regard. 

Anyway, we're fucked :) don't join the madness, live a low emissions lifestyle, vote only for politicians who think similarly and watch it unfurl... because humanity has chosen it's path.","2016-02-28 07:11:57","5","Capn_Underpants","1747662438.184224","IPCC report","scientific"

Its public relations.  We still have an oil economy...you still have people like the Koch brothers controlling the narrative.  Can you imagine how bad it would be for profits if people decided climate change is here, and it is going to be catastrophic.   

The other change that happened is like you said there has been a shift to viewing the climate as something that can be finely tuned. I think geoengineering is the generally agreed upon solution.  ","2016-02-27 22:52:54","2","[deleted]","1747662438.185311","IPCC report","scientific"
"d0gsntq","t3_47uhwf","47uhwf","collapse","skeptical",">Thus, the point that was always argued was that it's two degree or nothing. Even in Nature, we find prominent scientists calling for abandoning the 2 degree target.

The article calls for other measures of planetary health and not necessarily lowering the target, but replacing it with a gamut of indicators of planetary health. Also with the benefit that we know how choices will affect us. The average punter can't understand why 2 is the magic number, politically they will just keep raising the bar so its business as usual
