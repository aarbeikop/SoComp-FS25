You've probably seen Gravity, The Martian, or The Fantastic Four, so you know that outer space is a dangerous place.  But isn't outer space a vacuum of nothingness? Beyond no air to breathe, what else could possibly hurt you? It turns out...lots!

I investigate the physics at work in the almost-nothingness of our solar system.  I am also the Editor in Chief of the [Journal of Geophysical Research – Space Physics](http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/jgr/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2169-9402/) a leading journal in this field of understanding the Sun, solar eruptions, magnetic storms, the radiation belts, and the aurora at Earth and other planets. I am also currently teaching a very fun course at U-M called [SPACE 101: Intro to Rocket Science](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/courses/clasp/).

I hope to have an engaging discussion with you about the fascinating physics happening in the near-emptiness of outer space, and explore the many ways that space might pose a danger to astronauts, to satellites, or even to power grids here on Earth. I'll be back at 12 pm ET to answer your questions, Ask Me Anything!
