When convincing a skeptic, sometimes circumstantial reasoning comes across more effectively. when they hit me with arguments such as, ""it's exaggerated by left wing groups"" or ""it's all green lobbying and scare mongering"" and especially ""the science is uncertain"", I tend to reply with,

""Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests? 

You know what the biggest difference is between climate science in the 70s versus now? It's a trick question, because no major technology breakthrough has altered any of the early predictions. It was solid science back then. 

That's why Exxon Mobil started its own in house world class climate change research in the late 70s, to get a handle on the magnitude of the problem. Over the next 5 years it would go on to confirm all the worst established predictions from academic research and go beyond it. Investigative journalism revealed that they predicted very accurately what the concentration greenhouse gasses would rise to by 2020. They knew 50 years in advance we would have surpassed 400ppm by now, almost double the 'natural' level. They knew that by now the first undeniable signs of severe clays change would become apparent. It was a time when this problem could be solved with a relatively painless energy transition, avoiding the worst outcomes. 

Knowing all this, Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. 

All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism. Please do give it a read.""

Someone who doubts the physical science basis might not be easily swayed with more science. Establishing Exxon knew all of it 50 years ago can now, tragically, be used as ammo against doubters

"ercucu1","t3_c18wl0","c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented","Honestly, I think the problem is that most of us aren't climate scientists.  We recognize that actual climate scientists are freaking out about climate change, and we understand the basic science behind it, so we accept that it's true and something to be very concerned about.  But if we are challenged on the details of anything, it's hard to respond because we don't actually know the details.  The problem is, it's the vast majority of us who aren't climate scientists who are on the front lines of trying to convince the deniers.  It's our friends, our colleagues, our family that we're trying to convince.  What's needed is a tool to help us articulate our arguments and provide proper rebuttals.

I'd love to see an app developed in which you could simply search a common denier argument from a list or even a search bar and it would show the appropriate counter-argument.  It would have to be thorough, covering every denier argument, and each counter-argument would include a super concise answer for anyone who doesn't want to get super technical, and a more descriptive answer with more detail and citations.  Such an app would be super useful for anyone who gets into an argument with a denier - just look up the denier argument and read about why it's wrong.  This would be a good learning exercise for both the climate activist and the denier.","2019-06-16 21:56:49","3","Quelchie","1747647022.758901","climate science","scientific"
"erbq3o3","t3_c18wl0","c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented","Point one is not based in science, at all. The “power” that warms the Earth above the 3 Kelvin of outer space (not absolute zero) is the sun. It pushes over 1300 watts per square meter of energy into Earths system on the approximately 50% of the Earth where the sun shines.  Clouds, the surface of the oceans, ice, and the surface itself reflect some of that energy away.  Part of that energy is absorbed by the atmosphere before it ever reaches the surface. Some of that energy makes it through the atmosphere, past the clouds and is absorbed by the surface. The Earth radiates away the same amount of energy, but the radiation isn’t confined to the dark side of the planet. 

The surface radiates energy, but so does the atmosphere. All matter radiates energy based on the composition of the matter and the temperature. So, a warm atmosphere will radiate energy to space without that energy having come from the surface in the form of IR in the frequency that CO2 can capture. A GHG molecule, such as water vapor, will radiate in IR based on the temperature of that molecule, and it will cool via radiation. 

All other things being equal, more GHGs in the atmosphere must cause increased levels of IR radiation from the atmosphere, with half of that radiation going upwards and away from the surface.  The very first and most reliable test of Climate Change would be the IR brightness of the mid-troposphere. We should have a quantifiable and very easily demonstrated gauge of climate change simply by measuring the change in IR bouncing around at various levels in the atmosphere.","2019-06-16 13:04:03","2","deck_hand","1747647022.760776","climate science","scientific"
"erbzawt","t3_c18wl0","c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented"," - The reason it's detrimental 

It's about effectively framing runaway warming as a threat to us, instead of a threat to wildlife and somewhat of an inconvenience we can engineer our way around:

""We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius

The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years. Adding another 4 degrees Celsius to the top of the natural ice age - warm age temperature cycle.

Calling it global warming doesn't reveal the the implications of the problem the way climate change does. If the mean temperature increases world wide by 2 degrees, than you should not expect the same basic conditions but slightly warmer. Instead, it means macro shifts. 

For instance a monsoon that shifts in landfall location by hundreds of miles will cause droughts where it used to land and floods where it settles. Imagine water shortages for a city like new Delhi with 20+ million people. Imagine failed crops.

Besides warming, 2 degrees will be accompanied with rising sea levels and ocean acidification. This combination of effects is how 2 degrees is projected to eradicate tropical and sub tropical such as the great barrier reef which had been around the time the giant meteor eradicated the dinosaurs and which is the size of Western Europe. Further warming with its accompanied effects may critically reduce other sea life to the extent that it can no longer be relied on to feed three coastal populations in south East Asia. Home to over 2 billion people.","2019-06-16 15:21:14","3","Wallawallawallawa","1747647022.7629561","climate science","scientific"
"erdfzuf","t3_c18wl0","c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented","I think #1 is confusing, but the science might be confusing anyway.

A planet doesn't need an atmosphere to be warm. The radiation a planet receives from the sun needs to be irradiated out. This is called Radiative Equilibrium.

Now, a planet doesn't emit its own visible light. But it can emit infrared. How? By having a temperature. So the more energy it gets from the sun, the hotter the planet needs to be to maintain Radiative Equilibrium. In other words, it needs to have a Planetary Equilibrium Temperature.

When a planet has an atmosphere, its surface temperature is higher than the theoretical Planetary Equilibrium Temperature. Venus is an extreme example of this. It's because greenhouse gases block infrared, so the planet has to be hotter to maintain Radiative Equilibrium.","2019-06-17 03:06:18","2","j-solorzano","1747647022.764588","climate science","scientific"

3. A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

4. We do see it in first world countries! The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.","2019-06-16 12:32:02","1","Macralicious","1747647022.766104","climate science","scientific"

"er2o9az","t3_c04ksi","c04ksi","science","scientific","This isn't really formatted in the form of a question, but here goes. I often think about genetic engineering and brain machine interfaces. Particularly effective delivery mechanisms for genetic modification, monitoring cell behavior on a cell by cell basis in vivo, as well as the computational potential of DNA in DNA based computers, and the application of ribosomes in building man-made, protein based nano machines. 

I think life extension, gene modification in vivo and curing diseases like cancer or retro viral infections with directed apoptosis are possible in our lifetime. 

What if we could modify a mitochondria (not for the purposes of replacing the mitochondria but as a template for an entirely new artificial organelle with its own metabolism and DNA) to process data, network together on some kind of cloud network, synthesize oligonucleotide sequences from scratch, and express them from its own dna rather than integrating them into the nuclear genome? These mechanics would be all you need to download and express genes like apps without risking the health of the nuclear genome, as well as to monitor the health of the nuclear genome by sequencing and comparing the RNA expressed by it with other cells. Even if the processing capacity of every modified mitochondria was in the kbs, with trillions of cells you'd have an incredible amount of processing capacity and could run programs on the cloud network that are stored directly on DNA. Like running antivirus software that scans for actual viruses. This network could even be programmed to simulate a brain machine interface, giving the individual subjective access to their internal, cellular cloud network. 

There are countless applications. You could run thousands of genetic studies in parallel in a single petri dish. Every cell would be its own lab. And forget labs on a chip when you can directly express any cell type you want by programming it into a live cell culture. You could run these tests in parallel IN VIVO if you wanted.  

And I often imagine the kind of complex mechanics that we could engineer with this level of control. One of the proteins I imagined being expressed from these artificial mitochondria (I call them nanosomes) could lock together passively using modified nucleophiles. I imagined modifying a nucleophile so that it would have a dipole tail rotating on a single carbon bond. If arranged on a plane at an angle, you could create a 2d surface that switches between hydrophobic and hydrophilic states via phosphorylation. I imagined these little proteins to be in the shape of blocks, and they would be able to auto assemble into larger complexes by selectively locking each of their faces together like lego or a transformer. You'd only need to phosphorylate a junction once to lock it, and then again to unlock it. Over and over again. 

I guess amine/carboxyl groups already do this, minus the phosphorylation, but they don't auto-assemble in free space. And so far that's only one degree of motion. I also imagined building protein based optical tweezers for interacting with and grabbing onto dielectric molecules around the cell, which most polar molecules are. Single plasmon lasers can be built using complexes of only 10 or 20 atoms. If we could modify an amino acid to act as a single plasmon laser when phosphorylated, we would be able to produce an extremely efficient, directed light source that could have countless applications around the cell, and could be integrated into a protein by associating a codon to it. And again, this is expressed from an artificial organelle, so we'd have the luxury of being able to modify the codon language. From optical communication systems to microscopic spacial light modulators using chiral molecules abundant around the cell as the liquid crystal. A flexible lens made out of cholesterol or an even more simple chiral lipid would be able to change both the phase and focus of a microscopic light source. And while its difficult for us to make use of optical tweezers on the macroscopic scale, interacting with other molecules is ideal if you just want to identify single molecules or push/pull a neighboring proteins in a protein complex. And here's your second degree of motion. 

Also plasmons may sound like particle physics but they play a role in photosynthesis, especially for purple, sulfur based bacteria, which basically relies on sunlight and a plasmon cascade to produce an energy surplus from excitons when the cascade runs into the cell membrane. I read another paper demonstrating that this structure, the entire cell membrane, can become coherent and entangle with a quantum cavity. The largest structure to ever be entangled. And I think a lot about using these single plasmon lasers for quantum logic functions inside the cell, but given the ambient temperature of the cell, that's mostly speculative. 

Again, this isn't really formatted in the form of a question, but I would love to hear your thoughts on these or similar applications of using biology for the purposes of synthetic nano technology.","2019-06-13 17:28:43","3","Asrivak","1747647373.571059","climate science","scientific"

"erazlwg","t3_c11bjp","c11bjp","collapse","skeptical","This anti-capitalist theme pops up on collapse every few weeks which is fine but it seems to be latestagecapitalism threads and users cross-pollinating the idea that capitalism and only capitalism and no other -ism at all for any time period in history is to blame for the shitfuck storm humanity finds itself in now, today 2019. It's pretty much technicallythetruth but capitalism itself is just a small piece of the fuck pie.

Under communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarianism, kingdoms it's always been the same. The truth is societal collapse happens and will happen under any human -ism currently or previously devised, even animals and insects, once a population of an area, region or the globe exceeds that areas carrying capacity. It's a law of nature.

For humans, regional societies have grown and collapsed because they grew in numbers, destroyed their local environment and broke the carrying capacity.  For thousands of years this happened over and over with some growing bigger than others but all ending with collapses. Forest cutting for building, farming, food and energy helped increase the population and their use of more resources which accelerated collapse. Thru that time societies would intersect and war over territory and resources but under previous energy regimes, the environment and their use of energy didn't really result in any global system-wide effects. 

It wasn't until around 1900 and the discovery of oil / fossil fuels instead of human, wood, steam or electrical power that things kicked into high gear with the US, Britain and most first world nations adopting oil as a cheap source of energy. 1900 is used as the baseline for climate models because of the start of the mass adoption of fossil fuels. It's clear as day on the chart. That's when it started. 

It was just that fossil fuel use for the last 120 years by everyone on the planet since, including third-world nations, juiced the ability for all of humanity to overshoot the unbeknownst-at-the-time imaginary parity graph that showed fossil fuel use and population against Earth climate change factors.

From the billion or so people in 1900 to today's 7.7 billion people all were and are consumers. We eat and breathe and build and have gotten ourselves to the point where the rate that all the people in all societies consume, plus medicine that extended lifespans, advances in technology and global transportation that allowed us to do it faster to where the global carrying capacity overshot with no more areas for us to expand.

But not only did all- isms accelerate the planet's carrying capacity breakdown we also toxified it and now wrecked the climate to the point where it won't be able to support this many people all using fossil fuels for much longer. I don't know when but even if that fossil fuel stopped today, humans have already spewed enough emissions into the atmosphere since 1900 that the resulting effects that we see and will continue to see are already locked in. Ice melts affecting the climate,  sea levels and now the carrying capacity of the entire Earth not just one region but with 8 times the number of people from when we started 120 years ago.

Malthus was right he was just operating at a much smaller scale. But he did imagine populations in the billions just using his time's metric of the carrying capacity per acre per person. Fossil fuels blew up that relationship up too.

Population isn't decreasing, its increasing exponentially and humans are just destructive no matter what ism they live under.  They are destroying and have destroyed the planet so this can't be stopped until the planet's ability to sustain human life is greatly diminished which could reduce population drastically until it is somehow able to level off, but with a much wilder and inhospitable climate.

A fully agrarian society couldn't function with this many people without a non-emissions energy regime but it'll still end the same.
The 'it's all capitalism's fault' never offers any new societal structures or solutions that won't run into the same problem at the scales of people and energy use we are talking about today or 100 years from now. Communism or socialism isn't the answer nor is capitalism. It's too late and we are debating over who made the mess. 

We humans fucked it all up.

If it's economic, is it one where the dollar is not the world's reserve currency anymore because trust is lost in the US?  That means hyperinflation as the printing presses rev up to pay interest.  Keep money in gold, silver, or whatever else you think will hold value.  Look up and study Weimar republic.  Note: an economic collapse does not mean hyperinflation, but coupled with an erosion of pax american might be likely.

Is it peak oil?  Get some bikes, electric bike with solar charger, or maybe a 100+mpg scooter or motorcycle (typically 150cc or less).

Is it environmental?  Farming?  Etc.

See, every collapse will have different needs.

Here's what will always help:  Get and stay in shape.  I recommend plant based diet against chronic illness, no meat or low meat (less than 2oz a day, smaller than a deck of cards), no cow dairy.  Calisthenic aka bodyweight fitness.  This requires no or minimal tools and focuses on functional fitness, not winning aesthetic contests.  Most people are surprised to learn how some bodybuilders can't do a pull up or some other move.

Keep some months supply of food.  Dry starches hold well.  (Rice, beans, etc).  In waterproof and vermin resistant containers.  Read up.

Have tools and some basic scouting skills like rope tying.  Learn in spare time.

Have some self defense stuff.  A weapon.  If it turns ugly for a while.  Martial arts for the most part is worthless on the street.  Fair fights or 1 on 1 isn't a given.  Better learn from a bouncer or a real course on street psychology.  Better yet, just be be basic at parkour.

Have a circle of family and or friends to rely on.  No man alone is an island.  Or a fortress.  No Rambo fantasies.

I think you're misidentifying the underlying cause. Yes it is tempting to blame capitalism, especially if that is shorthand for human behavior; but there's no such thing as sustainable exploitation - not with so many people on the planet. It is all unsustainable, green-tinged or not, whether it is under the umbrella of capitalism or any other political system. What would be your alternative to capitalism? Tofu and lentils? Or do you think state control would help? What do you think of China's hybrid approach?

We're now in the Anthropocene, and post our industrial revolution we're part of a self-sustaining growth engine. We're inside that, we're part of it.  Everything from the food we ate today to the posts we made on Reddit. And even apparently free tech - Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than Ecuador [(source](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2151823-bitcoin-mining-uses-more-energy-than-ecuador-but-theres-a-fix/)).  Targeting the worst aspects of capitalism is fine - that might make people's lives better to do that, if you can; but most of the proposed fixes - including green energy - are still fixes that would add more growth. Carbon dioxide isn't our only problem; it's just one of them.

If you *would* like to find out more about why we are where we are, and why the growth engine may now be out of our control, there is a good analysis [here](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-weve-created-a-civilisation-hell-bent-on-destroying-itself-im-terrified-writes-earth-scientist-113055).

There is one other aspect of blaming capitalism that concerns me. That is that a mass movement might send us hell for leather into a worse situation where the state makes all the decisions. We really don't have a good history with that, no matter how well-meaning it starts. 'The state' inevitably degenerates into a self-interested cabal of robber barons.

PRECISELY THIS REASON is why I hate it when people yack on about foods being non-GMO. Have you eaten in the past 10,000 years? Then you've eaten a GMO. Literally nothing humanity subsists on today is the exact same flora or fauna as our distant ancestors found and decided ""hey, I like this"". There was always somebody, somewhere, sometime, that went  ""BUT, it'd be better if..."" The rise of agriculture 12? thousand years ago? meant the rise of crops and food animals bred to exist better given the climate and resources. Let science figure out how to lessen the impact of feeding humanity without as much of an impact.

Capitalism is simply a word that describes a system in which people are free to engage in voluntary trade and own private property.  Period.  It does not ""encourage"" anything.

It finally started being used in Europe in the 1600's, over 300 years later. Capital is represented by currency. For over 3,000 years, capital currency was coin. In fact, the Revolutionary colonies were having problems with too many paper currencies and notes, state to state, so that is why it is in the US Constitution that only Congress has the right to ""mint coin"".  
  
The China of today is communist in name only. They are authoritarian capitalist socialist in function. Anybody that has followed the Great Leap Forward proposed by Mao knows it was a total failure and was resulting in mass starvation. It was only when the Communist party decided to go socialist, that is, require the farmer to grow for the collecive, but allow him to grow a surplus for the market, that China's economy started to turn around.  
  
What is going on now with trying to blame capitalism for everything is also described by an ancient Chinese proverb:  
""The drowning dog will clutch at straws"".
