The summary for policy makers tried to put it in plain language but the whole thing is worth reading if you’re comfortable with the science. This is THE report by the scientific climate community.","2018-05-06 16:16:25","8","Broric","1747632805.0272992","climate science","scientific"

by Wallace S. Broecker  (Author), Robert Kunzig (Author)

The math is both excellent and deeply interesting in that book.  If you don't know about Wallace Broecker, it's also a great read about his efforts, as fruitless and worthless as they've been since pretty much nobody is listening anyway.","2018-05-18 07:00:05","2","Mathtoons","1747632805.032334","climate science","scientific"
"dz6tmb1","t3_8hfuv0","8hfuv0","climatechange","action-oriented","Hi op, I haven't read that book, but I have read ""introduction to modern climate change"" by Andrew E dessler which was used to teach a bachelor course I took on climate change. It's very good, and just as complex as it needs to be for you to get a very comprehensive and balanced view on the subject. Climate researchers at the University I attended in Denmark used it as the basis for their course so if it's in line with what they believe is important to know then it must be good. The maths isn't by any means difficult, especially for a maths major, but it really doesn't have to be to gain a good understanding of the most important factors. 

It also has chapters at the beginning that thoughroughly explain the evidence supporting global warming, as you ask for. And after the science, it transitions into ways we are and can prevent it.","2018-05-18 15:07:22","2","unmistakableregret","1747632805.036726","climate science","scientific"
