"329mon","climatechange","action-oriented","Where can I find IPCC TAR temperature projection output data?","Can someone please post a link to data of the temperature projections from the IPCC third assessment report (2000 / 2001)?  I've been told that these have poor correlation to actual temperatures, and just want to check for myself.  I understand that actual global temperatures are available at [HadCRUT](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/index.html) and [UAH LT](http://nsstc.uah.edu/climate/), but I would be interested to know if there are better data available.

Appendix II.4 of [WG1 TAR](http://ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/) has a table of model average surface air temperature change, but only for decades (ie every 10 years).  I am after data for the annual projections.
