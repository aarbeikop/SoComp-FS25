"bjr7yb","climatechange","action-oriented","Climate science most conclusive experiments","Hi, I’m trying to convince a stubborn uncle that climate change is real. He has a scientific orientation, so I thought I’d hit him with that angle. 

Where can I find a good list of conclusive experimental results on the science of greenhouse theory, climate change theory and the like?

His assertion is that climate science is only based on computer model interpretation, not experiments or tests. 

Help me prove him wrong!","2019-05-02 05:17:24","10","13","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bjr7yb/climate_science_most_conclusive_experiments/","True","jefemundo","1747646162.7968798","climate science","scientific"
"bqlwob","collapse","skeptical","I honestly think science will solve climate change before serious catastrophe. Just like CFCs. Prove me wrong?","Thanks a lot I want to be educated.

There should be a fact pack for idiots like me. I really want to learn exactly why we're fucked - because I like so many others cannot see it. 

I feel no urgency whatsoever, relying on science to figure it out.

Thanks","2019-05-19 20:52:25","0","19","0.31","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bqlwob/i_honestly_think_science_will_solve_climate/","True","turbotub","1747646760.656091","climate science","scientific"
"bk8x8h","sustainability","action-oriented","Jobs in Sustainability","I’m graduating college next week with a double major in Environmental Sustainability and Political Science, with a minor in Domestic and International Security. I really want to work at a job where I can make a positive environmental impact, but I don’t know where to start looking as there is much variety out there.

Can anyone tell me about jobs in sustainability, climate change mitigation, or any related environmental work that don’t include technical scientific knowledge, but allow you to make an impact and a decent living?

Thanks!","2019-05-03 14:11:07","72","20","0.98","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bk8x8h/jobs_in_sustainability/","True","jglanoff","1747646879.7169092","climate science","scientific"
