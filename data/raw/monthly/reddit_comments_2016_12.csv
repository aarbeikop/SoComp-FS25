"dark3wv","t3_5gb9wg","5gb9wg","environment","emotional","No. Did 10s of millions of marchers stop the Iraq war? No. Did millions of marchers make a difference with OWS? No. This kind of marching wastes time and energy that could be used to apply pressure better in more effective ways. Record marches in Wisconsin stop killing unions there? Did marches in Michigan stop them from privatizing water and poisoning Flint with lead? No. 

It breaks my heart to see good movements expend tons of energy and resources on things that are not very effective.  Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to waste energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does nothing by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches and sit-ins that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT THEY COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. So these actions just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not just the noisemaking. 

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the marches.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 

But today the public doesn't know what to do when faced with this challenge. They think that yelling in crowds makes a difference when all it does is get them put in some database. 

There are better alternatives. Take this guy who instead of holding a sign that was ignored, [buried a bad cop in paperwork](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/hostile-policing/Content?oid=17445843) and the evidence of this bad cop's activities [got him fired](http://www.king5.com/story/local/2014/09/02/13384714/). 

> Reply here to keep brainstorming. It feels good to at least be doing something.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective.

I could live with a Trump presidency if he switched only one of his political stances... climate change is real and it is caused by mankind and it must be stopped and reversed as soon as humanly possible.

His alleged racist and sexist principals, his belief in the USA being a Christian nation, his pro-big business doctrine and everything else I would ~~happily~~ grudgingly live with if he could just commit to protecting the planet.

Edit: We should invite Trump and his children to the March as well. I don't think they truly believe the nonsense preached by 1% of climate scientists around the world. We need to surround the president with people who love the earth and can convince him that it is in his best interest, both monetarily and politically, to switch his way of thinking. What better way to do this than have him front and center of the movement? He won't turn around overnight, but any gradual shift will be far better than the alternative.

"db88829","t3_5iha6f","5iha6f","science","scientific","Hey thanks for doing this AMA! This strikes really close to home for me, I live in north west Labrador above the 53rd parallel, very remote area, literally 700 miles in either direction to the next town.

We have a couple of unique features in my area and I'm hoping you can offer some advice.

We have a huge problem with dust. We're located in between two iron ore mines, two very large  ore productions within 2 miles of town.
Their tailings line's have piled up over the last 50 years so basically the entire outline of town is a giant sand pit 

Included a photo for reference. [You can clearly see tailings lines and their proximity to town.](http://imgur.com/FbWRwr4)

One of the mines closed a couple years ago leaving absoutely no upkeep for dust reduction.

And here comes problem number two, 
[the Forrest fire of 2013](http://imgur.com/kvyRyQb)

It's a bit hard to see but on that map but you can see the outline of the tailings sand pits from the previous photo and, in red,the amount of tree cover we lost to that one fire.

So, after spending the last 3 years choked to death with [dust](http://imgur.com/PcoQixp) in the summer time.

And being ""Conveniently"" located in between the two biggest CO2 producers east of Montreal, and with the upcoming changes in the carbon tax pricing

I've been looking at the viability of a Silviculture project to help with 
 
1) dust suppression
2) reforestation 
3) species diversification 
4) local area ascetics 
5) the creation of offset credits

So my questions are

What cold hardy species can be successfully introduced to a boreal forest area, dominated by coniferous trees to improve diversification? 

in regards to dust suppression, I'm assuming a root heavy shrub or bush, perhaps an alder bed might be more effective in retaining top soil material.
In the past they would just hydroseed grass on top, but that requires annual upkeep. Any species in mind that might have a good, fast growing(hopefully not super invasive), tight holding root system to use in between tress?

And honestly, I don't know very much about the creation of offset credits, any experience with this? 

And in regard to asethic, you can see the entire project area from my town, do you know of any diversification projects that had visual appeal for an area in mind during the creation process?  I'd love to look into them

Thanks agian for doing this AMA, look forward to your reply

My question silly at best. As water levels rise what will happen to the forests when there is bow a foot or so of sea water claiming the land. Take Florida for example, North Florida is about 25ft or so above sea level. Will trees just be sticking out of the flooded areas for X years until they die? If they survive (Assuming they are tall enough) will there just be weird tree top ecosystems, all refugees from the ground, sticking out above the waves.  So with that in mind, Should I plant redwood trees all around here?

Do your calculations account for the greater carbon emissions spent exploring in more remote regions, for more extensive geophysical surveys and dry wells for basins with smaller and less identifiable reservoirs, and for the higher development and maintenance emissions of deepwater fields?

I'd imagine the pre-tax/royalty financial costs for exploration and development in a basin, incorporating dry well expenses, amortized over production and added to extraction costs, might serve as a better proxy for emissions than measures of direct fuel expenditures for development (eg, drilling & fracking) and extraction (eg, SAGD & upgrading).

I'm really curious as to whether the generally acidic pH of Martian waters, as witnessed by studies such as [Fairén *et al.*, 2009](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2012/reprintLibrary/Fairen_et_al_2008.pdf) which posit extensive water-jarosite interaction, also holds true for the ice you found.","2016-12-02 17:23:04","2","Gargatua13013","1747617248.3323112","climate science","scientific"

I imagine in every craft there are blunders and setbacks so extreme they are marked in the respective calendars of that community. The kind of sobering events like a nuclear reactor meltdown adding to the stigma of nuclear power - that sort of thing.
