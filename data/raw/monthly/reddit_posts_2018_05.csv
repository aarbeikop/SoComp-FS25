"8hfuv0","climatechange","action-oriented","Best book on climate change science","I'm looking for a book who covers somewhat rigorously the science of climate change, not a pop science book, but that at the same is a introduction to the subject, accessible to a math major who doesn't have a background on science except for high school.  My main goal is to be able to really understand the evidence that supports global warming, and the natural processes underneath it.

Maybe it's important to add that as a math student I'm used to very hard books, and usually science books seems like they were written for children in comparison, so I think I can handle even books that require some background that I don't have.

Searching for such book, I found this one [https://www.amazon.com/Climate\-Change\-Science\-Synthesis\-Physical/dp/940079732X](https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-Science-Synthesis-Physical/dp/940079732X) by G. Thomas Farmer, and I'm wondering if someone here has a opinion about it.

I would appreciate any suggestions that help with my research on the topic.

Thank you.","2018-05-06 15:19:36","6","10","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/8hfuv0/best_book_on_climate_change_science/","True","AdrianVS","1747632804.567301","climate science","scientific"
