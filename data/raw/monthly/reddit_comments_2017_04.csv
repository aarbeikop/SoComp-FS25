"dgdh6eu","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","What are your opinions on nuclear power.

In my eyes renewable energy sources are not efficient enough to carry the energy demands of a big country. Especially those that do not benefit from solar or hydroelectric power have to rely on fossil fuels for electricity.

Nuclear power has its known risks but it can cut emissions for a low price. I think opting to combat climate change and opting against nuclear power are a combination that dont go well. I had Germany in mind when typing this. All the negatives of nuclear due to its neighbours, increased electricity prices, and increased reliance on coal. Climate change was used specifically to drive a political agenda.

What are your opinions on this.

"dgdi946","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","* Thanks for doing an AMA. As much as I understand that climate change by human activity is very real, I have always wondered if it made any sense to unilaterally act to reduce our carbon foot print. Even if the relatively richer west magically cuts out carbon emissions totally, which is impossible, the rest of the world (and thats a vast majority of human activity!) isn't going to do so. This is as much a political issue as it is a scientific one. If governments elsewhere can't even get a gripe on wars, crimes, corruption., etc.. there is no way they will start listening to the rich west telling them to slow down on development and be clean, even if they did believe in the legitimacy of the science, which itself has become debate in the west.


* I have always argued that rather than fund climate change policies, it would do a whole lot more good to simply fund education (reduce human stupid) and new technologies that out strip carbon reliance (this we have some, but not quite there yet). So that the developing nations actually want to adopt new methods of energy production. It is still economics in the end.


* I compare this situation to cancer research; I once attended a seminar where a speaker controversially declared that had all the billions in cancer research been instead channeled into eradicating cigarettes (taking down the big and powerful lobby of tobacco companies) and bad modern diets (as well as crap food lobbies), it would have prevented a whole lot more cancers than any of the new treatments and drugs combined.

It seems like the mutations that occurred within the dwindling mammoths were very detrimental to their survival, due to this broken process of natural selection. Would you say your evidence challenges the theory that species undergoing extinction end up actually branching out genetically, as their generations are forced into new environmental niches, most famously cited in the case of ammonite extinction taxa?

EDIT: ok, one more question--now that I think about it, I also don' t understand how *any* heterozygosity measures here can be considered reliable?  Both of the mammoth genomes were sequenced on Illumina machines at what most would (subjectively) call only medium-low coverage for a diploid (11x and 17x).  Given the Illumina sequencer's error mode is one of erroneous nucleotide *substitutions*, it really seems like any apparent heterozygosity could just as likely be sequencing error as ""real"" variation.

"dg5wpgq","t3_64xv6e","64xv6e","science","scientific","I recently read about a Russian group that are trying to create a population of mammoth-like creatures to help reduce the melting of Siberian permafrost and hence climate change. These mammoths would be made by modifying the genes of Asian elephants and incubating them in the lab. 

Firstly, how similar could these be to historical mammoth? Is the limit theoretical or 'only' technical? 

Do you think that if we were confident that this would be effective in reducing further global warming it would be a good idea? 

The reasoning wasn't so clear in the article, but from what I could tell, mammoth would eat away at the treeline which would result in more grassland, which reflects more sunlight than forest, which would reduce permafrost melting. Do you have any thoughts on this? To me it seems like logging and introducing grazers would be enough to have the same effect (and grazers are an existing part of the proposal). But I suspect I missed part of the argument. Are mammoths really good at killing trees? 

Finally, is the topic of bringing back mammoths something you get tired of, laugh at or dismiss entirely?

 So I have a few questions that may or may not be relevant. Here we go.
Do you know what exactly the mutation is? ELI5?
If so, could the mutation have been beneficial to the species but became useless once climate/environments changed?
Since there are two species are the mutations seperate? Or if it is the same can you tell which species was the original mutation?

The social signalling ""confusion"" seem quite fascinating. 

Any insight into whether this would of been exhibited by things such as increased violence against other Mammoth?  Is it possible that this produced ""poor"" mating choices by the mammoth herds? (Such as preventing or at least suppressing the mixing of mammoth herds)

Thank you for your time. 🙂
