They want to hype the fuel cell](http://tonyseba.com/toyota-vs-tesla-can-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-compete-with-electric-vehicles/). Tesla (and now also [Volkswagen](http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/vw-electric-car-paris-300-mile-range/)) are going full on battery. Mercedes had a little fling with Tesla but is now back on going the fuel cell way.

So who's right?

Biodiesel ELI5:
When you combine an alcohol (ethanol, methanol, etc.) with a fat (like vegetable oil), you produce a compound that is chemically identical to traditional diesel.  This means that it can be stored in the same tanks and pipelines used today.

Commercial biodiesel has been previously nonviable due to the cost of refining the inputs, namely the fats (removing acid, water, and other impurities) or sourcing the feedstocks in the first place.  (We do not want to displace commercial agriculture that supply food for the masses. Also, soybeans are very expensive in dollars and resources to grow.)

This has been changing as alternative sources of fats have been developed (growing in areas that are otherwise unfit for human agriculture, algae based are a few) and the production process has been better designed to be more efficient.  

I just don't know how much it's changed or if we will be seeing an impact anytime soon.  ","2016-09-14 14:14:52","2","TheBille","1747614381.555396","climate science","scientific"
