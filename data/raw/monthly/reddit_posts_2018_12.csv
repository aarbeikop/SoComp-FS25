Alex Reich is the co-founder of [MinuteEarth](https://www.youtube.com/user/minuteearth), an incredibly successful Youtube channel with over 2M subscribers focused on sharing bit-sized science and stories about our amazing planet. He helped start the channel and today serves as writer, editor and director because he believes (as do I) that science communication is a powerful tool for building awareness about how the world works and how we fit in.

**In** **our wide-ranging conversation, we cover many things, including:**

* The reality of climate change and what we can do about it
* Why we knew about climate change for years and did nothing
* How a trip to the Artic transformed Alex’s life for the better
* The problem with politics degrading facts and science
* How information is power and able to improve the world
* Why Youtube is a great way to build a following and disseminate information
* How Alex thinks about the environment and our future
* Why farming and food production are some of our biggest polluters
* The reason Alex is optimistic about the future
