I have a good idea how they work, converting CO and HC into CO2 and H20, and some of the three or four way converters can convert NOx into less harmful oxides.  I have a couple questions related to combustion engines.

* Is there a practical way for there to be a converter of some sort put on exhaust stacks for power plants, or potentially a converter on a jet engine, cruise ships, and container ships?  The automotive industry in the US has pretty strict emissions standards, where the aviation and maritime industry does not.

* Is there a way for these converters to eliminate CO and CO2 from exiting the exhaust of combustion in a car, power plant, or cargo/container ships so we eliminate those as sources for CO2 completely?  Is it possible for a converter to capture or convert all the CO2 from a combustion engine?

* Is there a way through chemistry that we can use an additive in gasoline, diesel, Jet A, Jet A-1, or heavy fuel oil to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted by burning these fuels?  What if there was a chemical process that took place in the combustion chamber that eliminated CO2?

""They are saying that that small amount of warming will trigger a further warming, through the effect mainly of water vapor and clouds. In other words, if you warm up the earth by 1 degree, you will get more water vapor in the atmosphere, and that water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas and will cause you to treble the amount of warming you are getting.""...""The clouds are making sure that warming isn't very fast. And they're certainly not exaggerating or amplifying it. So there's very, very weak science to support that assumption of a trebling""
