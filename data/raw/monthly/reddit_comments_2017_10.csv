From what I understand fluid shear in micro gravity can increase both virulence and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens.

Do we have the technology now to build a plausible spaceship (see below) that will protect human astronauts from all the dangers you mentioned, assuming this ship is going to travel between the planets (so a multi-year trip outside the Earth's protective magnetic shield)?  

By ""plausible spaceship"",  I mean one that can (for example) withstand those dangers without needing such a thick hull it'll never get off the ground.","2017-10-05 14:06:16","4","Senior0422","1747626607.191406","climate science","scientific"

"dny3k4h","t3_74fqke","74fqke","science","scientific","Hi Reddit! I'm Mike Liemohn, a Professor in the Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering department at the University of Michigan. I am also the Editor in Chief of the Journal of Geophysical Research – Space Physics. I study space weather in the solar system, in particular how electrically charged particles move space environments around Earth and other planets, causing beautiful displays like the aurora but also posing hazards to astronauts, satellites, and even power grids. Ask me anything!

Thank you all for posting so many great questions! I am looking forward to responding to as many as I can.  Please be patient as I type my responses.  I will try to get to as many as I can, but I apologize now if I don't make it to a question you wanted to see answered.

Also, I am typing as fast as I can.  Please excuse misspellings and grammatical errors, and even the occasional factual error in my responses.  As a trade-off to providing responses to more questions, I am keeping my answers fairly short and I am not going to dig up many supporting reference links. This will mostly be me, here in my office, typing away.

When you watch movies about how dangerous space is, do you enjoy it or get upset that Hollywood gets it so wrong? Is there any portrayal in modern media that you particularly like, either for it's accuracy or sheer ridiculousness?

Would you ever go into space if given the opportunity? Why or why not?

Is it feasible to use an artificial radiation source, such as a magnetron, in LEO to irradiate a precise target on Earth? What factors would prevent such a device from working? From what I understand, with a precise enough waveguide and a high enough wattage, it should be possible. Thank you!

P.S. Alternatively, could a weapon system such as this be used to destroy hostile alien space ships?","2017-10-05 15:26:11","2","Skydronaut","1747626607.199671","climate science","scientific"

Regarding bacteria, could some actually survive in space for a long time (if so, for how long?) and reactivate when put in a favorable environment? How dangerous would they be? And what would be the mechanism behind their survival in space?

Otherwise, on the subject of radiations, what would a dose received in deep space for a given amount of time, beyond Earth's magnetic field, compare to what we can receive on the ground? How deadly would be such a dose?  

Edit : another question : how powerful would a solar storm need to be in order to 1) significantly damage satellites, 2) have a non-negligible effect on ground infrastructure?","2017-10-05 15:51:28","2","Hafornin","1747626607.202606","climate science","scientific"
