Q
An argument to fight global warming more often than not is to preserve our planet and the diversity of it. While I agree that all the data points towards an ever hotter planet, the same data shows that its been hotter in the past. So I ask if you agree with my assessment that greenhouse gas emissions take up a little bit too much space in the debate.

I mean, it's not global warming that kills off the Rhino, burn vast amounts of rainforest to grow crops, put plastic in our oceans, drain the aral lake, completely devastate the ocean floor while overfishing...... List goes on. 

Unless you have an interest in the field you seldom if ever hear about the above, and while it may seem that they are local problems. They really aren't. 

I just think that while an ever hotter planet is a bad thing(or rather, the rate of which it changes) and should be a concern, there are other imminent threats that happens without anyone knowing because co2 emissions are easier to measure and gets all the attention. The rate of which we as a human race kills off habitat for, and animals themselves is just off the charts.

I'm also aware that humanity has basically gone ""over the cliff"", and we're now in between going over the edge and hitting the ground, leaving geo-engineering as the only viable way to avoid human extinction at this point.

Question 1: I know the spraying of sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere is commonly mentioned as an attainable way of deflecting solar radiation. However SO2 also breaks down ozone, which would make it unsuitable for sustained use. Are there any other compounds currently being considered? Compounds that could remain in the stratosphere for some time, and accomplish the same as SO2 or better?

Question 2: Are you aware of any serious (= large budget) programs currently concerned with artificial CO2 sequestration? I saw a calculation the other day of the energy required to draw all excess carbon out of the air and store it, and the number was just astronomical. Do you consider it likely humanity can start sequestering carbon on an industrial scale in the next 10 years?

"dfnldn0","t3_62kss7","62kss7","science","scientific","Why haven't you put forward any concrete goals? I read through your websites stances and goals and there is not a single actual tangible goal. Mostly esoteric goals about diversity in STEM and how science is good for everyone.

This march doesn't appear to have a purpose outside of virtue signaling about science being great. It doesn't even specifically reference what funding is being cut in the part about defunding or what you recommend funding in it's place.

I'm a scientist who disagrees with the marchforscience because my experience in reality doesn't align with what you appear to be putting forward. It is not anti-intellectualism or lack of diversity that is wingclipping the scientists of the future, it's the dynamics of global economics. The fact that that is unaddressed alienates me as a scientist from your cause.

Here is why I would not suggest someone become a Chemist as I did (In ultra summary form). Even if someone was passionate about Chemistry I would tell them to think long and hard about joining my field. With respect to pharmaceuticals. Large companies are outsourcing large amounts of their workforces or recruiting largely low wage foreign nationals, driving the payscale of incoming entry level scientists through the floor. massive prohibitive costs by regulatory agencies make production of in human therapeutics insanely expensive. This has driven the industry more towards sourcing their projects by buying out (often foreign based) CROs or simply contracting the development milestones to the CROs leading to downsizing or elimination of domestic R&D. Doing specialist contract labor or flipping companies isn't an entry level market so there is often no place for entry level employees in this new ecosystem. Due to a mixture of economic recession and decreased federal spending the idea of getting a PhD and then entering tenure track academic careers is becoming less and less viable. These days if you get a degree you're looking at having spent 8+ years in school (ignoring post doc work if you do that) to fight tooth and nail over relatively low paying jobs with no chance at advancement not only against other domestic grads, but foreign grads and against an enormous force of experienced workers who are now re-entering the workforce.

So when I see the bleak future of myself and my fellow scientists early in their career and I see awful job/career prospects due to regulation/outsourcing/globalization/economics and you march on washington with non-concrete handwavey goals about diversity and outreach it makes me want to distance myself from your movement.","2017-03-31 16:12:08","109","doctorcrass","1747619970.120817","climate science","scientific"

I am currently planning on attending, but it is clear to me (from Facebook, Twitter, and my own lab) that people have growing concerns about the way the march is heading. Specifically, the march seems to have gotten a bit off-topic by incorporating LGBTQ issues, as well as some pseudoscience groups, into its core mission. While I am extremely liberal and an active supporter of LGBTQ and similar movements (not the pseudoscience, though), many scientists simply aren't interested in marching for those things. Thus, incorporating ""protest culture"" into the march has taken away from the core message of the group, politicizing and polarizing what should be a non-partisan issue. 

My questions

- How do you plan to keep the march on topic? Lots of people are mad at the moves this administration is making, and for lots of reasons. Is the point just to raise numbers and get everyone involved to show how mad we are about the entire direction of the whole country, or to effect specific policy changes that we want as a field/pursuit/industry? 

- Do you not alienate, say, Evangelical Christian or Muslim scientists from your march by claiming that the social liberal agenda is a ""scientific issue""? What about public perception among social conservatives who support science, biomedical research, or biotechnology? 

- I know you aren't the ""thought police"" but how do you intend to prevent pseudoscience groups (like anti-vaxxers) from using this march as a platform to legitimize their movements?","2017-03-31 15:14:41","86","subito_lucres","1747619970.1235468","climate science","scientific"
"dfnjyk5","t3_62kss7","62kss7","science","scientific","I'm not crazy about the march. Here's my main two reasons why.

(1) The public doesn't perceive that scientists are not passionate or caring. The public perceives that scientists don't work on issues relevant to everyday concerns and don't come to a single concrete consensus the way other professional classes do. A march isn't going to help explain why, for example, working on the development of a fly eye is relevant to understanding cancer in humans. (It is! Ask a molecular biologist why!) Or why having 98% of scientists agree on man-made climate change IS a consensus. That level of dissent is ridiculously low for matters scientific.

(2) The numbers are going to be poor relative to other marches. The visuals of fewer people than the inaguration or women's march, for example, will not do the scientific community any favors among those who are sore about the perceived ""slight"" by the media about reports of low inaguration numbers. 

There are a lot of things we can do to promote science in this country. Walking through the streets of DC chanting ""Hey Hey Ho Ho NIH cuts have got to go"" is not one of them. 

Activism is good, but a march, not so much.

I'm happy to hear the organizers' thoughts on this.

"dfnb34l","t3_62kss7","62kss7","science","scientific","Hi everyone, and thank you for doing this AMA. I think the March for Science is a great idea, and I am looking forward to marching myself in DC later next month.

I have a couple of questions for you. First, you say:

> The March for Science champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity. We unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good and for political leaders and policy makers to enact evidence based policies in the public interest.

This is something that I think sounds great in principle, but is a bit hard to define when you get closer to the problem. For example, what is the criteria for determining whether a national science program is being 'robustly funded' (a percentage of GDP?) or what do you mean by science that is 'publicly communicated' (is this a critique of paywalled journals?).


My second question relates to a talking point that I have seen floating around your social media - the idea that the March is a non-partisan, but political event. I get the concept, and I understand why a nonprofit organization has to be non-partisan, but let's be real: in the U.S. the major threat to science and scientific policy comes from Republicans and in particular the Republican in the White House. I say this because, I have seen the idea that ""both sides have anti-science views"" gain traction. That seems like a huge false equivalency to me. No major policy position by the Democratic party comes anywhere near the level of some of the anti-science policies GOPers in the US are clamoring to enact. So I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that, and I wish I would hear a lot less of the ""both sides are bad"" nonsense from the MfS.

Thanks! Looking forward to the March.","2017-03-31 12:34:01","56","SirT6","1747619970.128351","climate science","scientific"

"dfngjyl","t3_62kss7","62kss7","science","scientific","It would seem that science has become trendy in popular culture, so that people that don't really understand it, embrace it if just for the ""cool factor"". So much so, that it generated a counter-movement, and some people roll their eyes at the first mention of the word ""science"". This type of trend dynamics is common to other things like fashion, music styles and so on. I would argue, admittedly without any hard evidence, that we've reached ""peak science"", and perhaps we are enduring the backlash.

Now, conjectures apart, I don't think you can teach science, same way you can't teach religion. Attempting to do so is very superficial, and all you're left with are dogmas. In a way, without sufficient understanding, people will accept science the same they accept any other ideas: that is to say, blindly. On the other hand, you'll have people rejecting science for similar reasons. More important than teaching ""science"", is probably teaching philosophy and give person rational tools to make up their own minds. If not philosophy, at least a strong critical sense, which is maybe what science boils down to. I'd argue this is the best way to avoid those dogmas, and the main difference between a religious and a scientific view of reality.

I realized I don't really have a question, but these two: 

1. what exactly is the message you are trying to get across?

2. what is your plan to do it and minimize the backlash, and without sounding ""pedantic"" or ""passé"", bearing in mind that that message will be filtered by the media?

I have a few comments and questions, but first a little about my own background. I'm a professional scientist (PhD in Physics) who works at one of our national laboratories. Many of our national labs, including where I work, are more conservative than liberal due to the nature of the work we perform. On the political spectrum, I normally fall somewhere in the middle (social liberal/fiscal conservative with many nuances), trying to rely on being accurately informed prior to forming opinions, and openly willing to change my mind.

Because the march for science is a reaction to the suppression of scientific information by the current crop of politicians, and an attack on the scientific method more generally, I feel this is a crucial movement. 

I am concerned that this movement will devolve into an anti-Trump/anti-Republican agenda, allowing conservatives to easily dismiss the crucial advancements science provides for everyone (not only the general public, but also war fighters and national security, which are near and dear to the conservative ideal), by simply claiming the movement as a liberal agenda. Scientists know this is false, but scientists do not communicate well with the general public.

1. What ideas does the movement have to address the misunderstanding by the general public of the process and importance of science for the months and years after the march? 

I see this disconnect as more systemic than simply the administration/congress de jour. For example, the space race did wonders to cement the relationship between science and a positive popular opinion. 

2. What is the plan to help break free from a political label?  

This is of course complicated and nuanced. The reason for the protest is directly linked to the anti-science agenda that republicans have been pursuing for decades, but liberals are not immune to such stupidity. **I'm looking at you anti-vaxers**. One suggestion would be to encourage participants to RESPECTFULLY carry the American flag. I realize this is not something scientists are particularly comfortable with, and many scientists are not American by birth or identity. However, our protest is that the American government is not acting the way we think the American government should and the consequences are dangerous. We have to stand up and say ""Americans will not stand for our government behaving this way,"" and should therefore carry the flag as a symbol. In addition, popular opinion is swayed by images and video. Having a prominent American symbol associated with the movement will help persuade people, and make it difficult to be labeled as simply a liberal movement. In other words, the movement cannot come across as unAmerican.

3. Would it be better for the movement to attend our local march, or head to D.C.?","2017-03-31 16:38:28","18","medalgardr","1747619970.151338","climate science","scientific"

This comes from the same person who [accused NOAA researchers of falsifying data](https://science.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-probes-allegations-politicization-noaa-study) and asked for their emails to determine any wrong-doing based on what he read in a blog and a tabloid article from Daily Mail. The ""whistleblower"" from NOAA clarified his post later on to say that there was ""[no data tampering, no data changing, nothing malicious](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3fc5d49a349344f1967aadc4950e1a91/major-global-warming-study-again-questioned-again-defended),"" but Smith has repeated his accusations and has not retracted his statements despite having no evidence. His statements and actions against science go back years, but they are reaching a fever pitch now with [the House passing two bills that would limit EPA from using the best science and scientists to drive policy and regulations](http://democrats.science.house.gov/press-release/house-passes-another-bill-would-harm-science-epa) ([Call your senators](https://callyourrep.co/)!

I'm a first year graduate student in meteorology, therefore I am a TA and have the pleasure of grading for the intro level classes. One of the professors doesn't believe in anthropogenic climate change, and though he 'tries' to teach in a manner that hides his bias, it definitely shines through in the final papers the students write. When I'm grading, how can I effectively portray to students that it is indeed a real and serious thing? In the same vein (yet a different class), the professor is going to start talking about climate change. These kids are freshmen and have a very elementary understanding of weather and climate. What's an effective way to teach them and to get them to think critically about the subject? 

Next week my school is putting on a student showcase so that we can present our research. Within this there is going to be a round table discussion about climate change and how we as scientists communicate it. Here are a few of the sample questions that we will be discussing : 
-Do we need to change the way scientists are educated (e.g., broaden, add more ""soft skills"" or social science)? 
-To what extent do scientists need to be involved in decision making?
-How much responsibility do scientists (as opposed to journalists or school teachers) hold for increasing public understanding of scientific/environmental issues?

As a global warming skeptic, please explain how carbon dioxide can be responsible for planet wide increase in the greenhouse effect (warming) when CO2 is only a fraction (<1%) of the greenhouse effect. 

I don't think anyone denies the fact that CO2 levels are rising, I just completely doubt the idea that this one tiny greenhouse gas could actually affect the weather on this planet. I think a more reasonable explanation is increased solar activity is increasing the amount of water vapor (THE LARGEST GREENHOUSE GAS) in the atmosphere which in turn is warming the planet. 

Do global warming extremist ever feel bad that CO2 is plant food, and by trying to reduce CO2 they are actually reducing plant life on the planet? I believe plant life was at its greatest when volcanic activity on the planet was higher and spewing tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, which provided for the huge plant life which created more oxygen as a byproduct, allowing for larger animal life. 

I will admit though, that even as a skeptic, the amount of filthy pollution in the air in places like China IS a problem, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's warming the planet.

In the article you published, can you please comment on why specifically these analogies were chosen to be tested? Are they normally used to explain climate change to people?
Do you have any indications or assumptions as to why the medical analogy works better than the other two?
Can the ""climate sceptics"" introduce bias by presenting the analogies weaker in influence, not because they are not clear, but because they come with their own prejudice?

As far as I can see this study concentrated more on analogies convincing people that action is needed in spite of lack of absolute certainty in prediction of climate change consequences. Are there studies oriented on the use of analogies in explanation of the process and mechanisms of climate change, and specifically in dispelling the misinformation and falsehood about climate and human influence on climate change?
