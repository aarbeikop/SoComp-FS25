We’re Drs. Jessica Hellmann and Tessa Hill and we are here to talk to you about improving how scientists can talk with the public about climate change. 

Climate scientists see firsthand the current and potential impacts of climate change, and often feel compelled to share these scenarios with the public and highlight the way their science intersects with critical societal interests. Yet, even the most capable science communicators can improve how they talk with non-scientists about crucial social and scientific issues in ways that both capture their complexity and move the dialogue forward.

The science of scicomm suggests it’s important to find common ground. There are promising practices developing within scicomm, and many scientists have had communication successes.  We’re here to help you improve your scicomm skills and share our stories from the field—Ask us anything!

This AMA is being facilitated as part of the [AAAS Leshner Leadership Institute](http://www.aaas.org/pes/leshner-leadership-institute), a fellowship program that helps foster scientists’ scicomm and public engagement skills.

[Jessica Hellmann](https://jessicajhellmann.wordpress.com/): I lead the [Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota](http://environment.umn.edu/).  I study global change and was among the first to propose and study new techniques for protecting ecosystems and people from climate change. 

[Tessa Hill](https://hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com/): I am at [UC Davis](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/)  and I study the impact of climate change on the ocean. I am experienced in science communication, including working with teachers and engaging stakeholders. I recently served on the West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Panel.

For background: [Sara K. Yeo’s 2015 paper, “Public Engagement with and Communication of Science in a Web-2.0 Media Environment”](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/content_files/public%20engagement%20social%20media_Yeo_single.pdf) is an excellent literature review of the scicomm field as it applies to social media.  Perhaps nowhere are the insights she collects more needed than when discussing climate change.

I’m Dr. Gerry Bell, a meteorologist in the Climate Prediction Center at NOAA’s National Weather Service, I lead teams of scientists at NOAA who predict the Atlantic, eastern Pacific and central Pacific hurricane seasons every year. Ask Me Anything!","Hello Reddit!


I’m Dr. Gerry Bell, a hurricane climate specialist and research meteorologist with NOAA's National Weather Service at the Climate Prediction Center. My research into the climate factors that control seasonal hurricane activity helped NOAA launch the first seasonal Atlantic hurricane outlook in 1998. Since then, I've been the lead scientist on the team that predicts Atlantic hurricane seasons and lead author of the annual hurricane outlook. I've spent a great deal of my professional career researching, publishing, and lecturing on the science of Atlantic hurricane activity, primarily the factors that fuel or hinder storm development. 


Each year, we monitor global climate patterns and use advanced computer models to predict how many named storms will form in the Atlantic, how many will become hurricanes (Category 1-2), and how many will become major hurricanes (Category 3-5). While our team can't predict how many hurricanes will make landfall, the seasonal outlook provides a general idea of whether the season will be slow or active based on climate patterns running in the background and influencing storm development. It also provides everyone in hurricane-prone areas with a great opportunity to get prepared.


On May 27, in fact, we issued our 2016 Atlantic hurricane season outlook. It calls for a near-normal season with a 70-percent likelihood of 10-16 named storms and 4-8 hurricanes, of which 1-4 could be major hurricanes. The announcement is available on NOAA.gov at http://www.noaa.gov/near-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-most-likely-year.


I’ll be here from 1:00 pm EDT to 3:00 pm EDT today answering your questions about our predictions for this year and the science behind how we make those predictions … AMA!

Wow, two hours went by fast!  Thank you for your interest in science, and especially the science of seasonal hurricane forecasting. You asked some great questions, and I enjoyed this opportunity to connect with you and share information about my passion for hurricanes, climate, and hurricane season predictions. I have to put in a very important parting plug for preparedness ... 

Regardless of our outlook, it only takes one landfalling hurricane to devastate a community and change lives forever. Now is the time to get prepared for the 2016 hurricane season — do it before the storms threaten and stay safe this hurricane season. Below are some links to information I know you will find useful in preparing yourself and your family for the hurricane season. Until next time!

"4pg9t1","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: Hi Reddit, I’m Mike Ellis, head of climate and landscape change science at the British Geological Survey and a member of the Anthropocene Working Group, here to talk about the impact of human activity on the Earth. Ask Me Anything!","I am Mike Ellis, head of climate change and landscape change science at the British Geological Survey in the UK, an editor of the [AGU journal Earth’s Future](http://tinyurl.com/hso4tdg) and a member of the [Anthropocene Working Group (AWG)](http://tinyurl.com/lhpzlrp). The AWG is an international group of scientists and experts convened by the International Commission on Stratigraphy -- the governing body of all things related to the Earth’s chronology – to study whether human activity has driven Earth into a new geological age. The group is examining the question of whether the proposed Anthropocene can be defined by a globally distributed signal, a marker of some sort that has the potential to be a permanent part of Earth’s history.

The AWG will present its progress and recommendations at the International Geological Congress in South Africa in August, with a formal proposal to follow at some time in the future. No one disagrees with the fundamental proposition that humans have had and continue to have a significant impact on the Earth, and a consensus is rapidly developing for marking the change to a new geological age in the mid-20th Century. [I co-authored a study](http://tinyurl.com/zdsy4u5)  the topic in the AGU journal Earth’s Future earlier this year ([and here’s another related article](http://tinyurl.com/z6qg9z6) published in Science earlier this year). I’ve also written about the moral implications of the Anthropocene with philosopher Zev Trachtenberg from the University of Oklahoma ([also published in Earth’s Future](http://tinyurl.com/hxa6lsh)). There are, in fact, many interesting questions that spin off from the proposition of an Anthropocene and go beyond the issue of when precisely it began. One of those questions that I am tackling is how do we formally engage the role of humans in predictive models of Earth’s future?

I hope to answer lots of interesting questions about the impacts of climate change and the Anthropocene during the AGU AMA! See you all soon!

We are here to talk about the global coral bleaching event that we are experiencing right now. Ask Us Anything!","Hi Reddit! I’m [Jennifer Koss](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/profiles/dec13/koss.html), director of the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program. I’m [Mark Eakin](http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/Eakin_M.php), a coral scientist with the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program and coordinator for NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch. And I’m [Randy Kosaki](http://www.hawaiianatolls.org/research/NOWRAMP2002/interviews/dr_randy_kosaki.php), deputy superintendent for research and field operations at the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.

We’re here to answers your questions on the longest global coral bleaching event on record and what we can, and are, doing to help. 

Did you know that in October 2015, NOAA declared the third ever global coral bleaching event on record? Since then, we’ve reported that it could extend well into 2017. This bleaching event is hitting U.S. coral reefs disproportionately hard. Here at NOAA, we estimate that as of March 31, 2016, all U.S. coral reefs have been exposed to ocean conditions that can cause corals to bleach.

Coral bleaching and disease, brought on by climate change and coupled with events like the current El Niño, are the largest and most pervasive threats to coral reefs around the world. 

While this news has us worried, don’t count corals out! They are remarkably resilient organisms. Here at NOAA we are working with marine resource managers and communities all over the US and internationally to reduce local stressors—like fishing pressure and pollution—to promote reef health and help these amazing creatures resist or recover from bleaching events. 

We’re here today to discuss the latest information on this bleaching event, what happens to corals when they bleach, explore what this all means, and identify what NOAA scientists are doing to address this threat.
