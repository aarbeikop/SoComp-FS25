"dxie3fv","t3_8crokc","8crokc","climatechange","action-oriented","Climate change in a nutshell:

 - The greenhouse effect is a thing which exists, caused by particular atmospheric molecules known as greenhouse gases, which cause temperatures near the Earth's surface to be warmer than they would be without those gases.

 - The greater the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the warmer the Earth's surface will be.

 - CO2 is a greenhouse gas.

 - The quantity of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by nearly 50% over the past couple of hundred years.

 - Due to our understanding of the greenhouse effect that increased CO2 means we expect warming to have occurred. And we observe that warming has occurred.

 - Increased atmospheric CO2 is caused by human activity, primarily burning of fossil fuels.

"dxio2ty","t3_8crokc","8crokc","climatechange","action-oriented",">my father doesn't believe in climate change

What does that mean? I see seven responses so far to your vague description, each presuming to know what you mean. 

Does your father believe:
1. Climate never changes?
2. There is no greenhouse effect keeping the Earth habitable?
3. Humans are not adding CO2 to the atmosphere?
4. CO2 is not a greenhouse gas?

What do you think is the level of your father's ignorance? Maybe his understanding is more nuanced than yours. Maybe you asking Reddit betrays a lack of understanding and knowledge on your part that skews your perception of your father's belief.","2018-04-17 16:52:45","4","JazzboTN","1747631865.545995","climate science","scientific"
"dxhf3cf","t3_8crokc","8crokc","climatechange","action-oriented","This answer is kind of a tangent, but just take a moment to consider: Arguing with people about *climate* probably can't arrive at a genuinely constructive conclusion. Because the climate is a pretty ineffable thing to individuals — approachable only through analysis of a larger body of statistics than most people have time to consider.

I think it's much more effective to address certain concrete *effects* of climate change:

1) Sea-level rises

2) Ocean acidifcation

3) Ecosystem collapses, on land and at sea

4) High-energy storm events

Also you can try to describe the eventual cost of removing excess GHGs from the atmosphere, with people who are willing to admit there might be *some* plausible limit to the atmosphere’s GHG capacity. Although it’s probably more important first to identify people who *don’t* believe there’s any such limit — because that’s such a nonsensical view that it’s probably useless to continue discussing climate issues with them.

Why is Venus hotter than Mercury even though it's farther than the sun?
Why is it cold in space and not on Earth? 
Why does a glass greenhouse heat up in the sun.
Fourier's theory of why the earth is warm.
Tyndall experiment's proving greenhouse gas effect.
