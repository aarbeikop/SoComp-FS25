"6erjjd","science","scientific","r/science Stands with the Paris Climate Agreement","Hello everyone,

Earlier today [President Trump announced his intention to exit the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-announce-us-will-exit-paris-climate-deal/2017/06/01/fbcb0196-46da-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?). While r/science ~~does not take a stance on political issues~~ *generally strives not to take a political stance, this issue is so exceptional and is heavily science-related that we made an exception*. We feel the need to reaffirm our commitment to solid science, and in that regard we strongly disagree with these actions. [Climate change is real](https://climate.nasa.gov/) and it's happening right now. [There is still time left to do something about it](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/index.htm), but this requires the actions of all people of the world. 

We decided to create this thread to welcome discussion and questions from the users about climate change and the Paris Agreement. We will be moderating this thread [less heavily than we normally do](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules), but we still ask that you be civil and respectful in the comments.  Comments that go against established science must include **peer-reviewed** citations, and egregious dismissals may result in bans.

EDIT: Please note the edits above in italics. 

r/askscience is [also holding a megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ertms/askscience_megathread_climate_change/) on this issue. Feel free to ask questions there as well.","2017-06-02 02:06:29","72545","8322","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6erjjd/rscience_stands_with_the_paris_climate_agreement/","True","rseasmith","1747622650.0101812","climate science","scientific"

I am currently Chair of Climate Physics and Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate, University of Leeds, UK. Ask Me Anything!","I'm Piers Forster and I principally research causes of past climate change and how well we can predict future climate change. I can take Qs on the evidence base for human-induced global warming and how much we should trust our climate model predictions of possible futures, including uncertainty in climate sensitivity – the Earth’s response to a doubling of carbon dioxide – one of the biggest uncertainties in climate science. I also lead an interdisciplinary centre looking at climate solutions, and I would welcome a discussion of ideas on possible solutions. Does solar geoengineering or large-scale carbon capture and storage have legs? Where should we concentrate research effort? Any whacky ideas we should look into?

**I’ll be back at 11am EDT to answer your questions. Ask Me Anything!**

"6fsur0","science","scientific","PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi reddit, my name is Brian and I published a study in PLOS Biology showing birds in the tropics have greater genetic variation than those in more temperate habitats – Ask Me Anything!","Hi Reddit,

My name is Brian Smith and I am an Assistant Curator of Birds at the [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/) in New York City. My research focuses on understanding the evolutionary relationships and origins of bird species.

I will be joined by Glenn Seeholzer who is a postdoctoral researcher at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He studies patterns of genetic diversity and speciation in Neotropical birds.

We, along with other colleagues, recently published a paper titled “A latitudinal phylogeographic diversity gradient in birds"" in PLOS Biology. In our study we found that tropical bird species have greater genetic variation than those occurring in temperate habitats. Our findings have important implications for understanding why tropical rainforests have so many species.

We will be answering your questions at 1pm ET. Send us your questions!

"6grkxy","science","scientific","American Geophysical Union AMA: Hi Reddit, I’m Jill Trepanier, Assistant Professor of Geography at Louisiana State University (LSU), here to talk about the science and risk of hurricanes. Ask Me Anything!","I am Jill Trepanier, Assistant Professor in the Geography and Anthropology Department at LSU. I’ve been at LSU for five years, and my area of expertise is the understanding of hurricane risk variability. I have been working in the area since 2007 and am fascinated with all things extreme weather. The types of questions I ask include why do hurricanes more frequently visit Louisiana compared to Tampa, Florida? Are we starting to see more severe hurricanes in a warmer climate? What changes happen to hurricanes when ocean temperatures rise? And what is the likelihood of extreme winds and deep storm surges at locations along a hurricane-prone coastline? Typically, I use statistics and maps to help answer my questions. And, as a geographer, I always make sure that the spatial element of the problem is included because, for me, differences across space are everything!

I'll be back at 12 pm ET to answer your questions, ask me anything!
