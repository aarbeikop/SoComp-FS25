1. The joined material - can it be verified through non-destructive testing for errors?  Can this testing be done for each part on an assembly line or progressive die?  Ie. In a spot weld, you can use infrared to see areas that cool faster which indicate an air pocket or other issue since the weld should cool uniformly.  Can you use a technology such as ultrasonic or radiation to verify bonding?

2. Do you see this technology being used first person in some shape or form?  Ie. On military vehicles, a lot of the welding is done by hand.

3. As you know, maintenance cost of equipment on an assembly line can be very pricey.  This technology sounds like it can lower some of this cost.  Do you think if this technology was generic enough for prices to be competitive that it would lower the costs of maintenance on current welding lines?

On the other hand, explosive welding, with it's moving wave front, appears to overcome this problem.  

So here's the question (and apologies if this has already been beaten to death in your circles):  Can a vaporizing foil actuator be made which vaporizes along a moving front, so that the joint can be fully-filled like explosive forming, as opposed to ring-shaped as you presented in the video.  I don't know the first thing about these vaporizing foil actuators, but it seems like even if you can't make the foil vaporize in a moving front, maybe you can make it V-shaped in cross-section to at least simulate a moving wave-front.

Wild idea number 2:  Make the foil actuator corrugated, so that maybe you can get a cascade of linear joints.  The corrugations also act as a natural stand-off control mechanism, so that the gap between the foil and flyer is more easily controlled.

I'm not actually able to watch your video just yet because in at work but I did have a couple questions for you. 

1. From what I remember of the article the process is supposed to be similar to spot welding only less heat transfer to the part, less energy required to make the weld and better joining of dissimilar metals. If thats correct is there a plan in the future for use of this technology in other process outside of spot welding? 

2. The article mentioned something about pressure and the 2 pieces being welded coming together at (x) MPH, I can't remember the exact number but it was really fast. What causes that? Are you using machinery to create that pressure or is something involved in the burning velocity or pressure created by the aluminum foil burning? 

3. Right off the bat the first thing that came to my head is that it seemed like a small scale version of explosion welding, only instead of using explosives using aluminum foil. Also cold welding came to mind. Is there any similarities to those processes of welding.

Thanks for your time. ","2015-11-09 16:49:24","3","AJAX1904","1747605074.8888588","climate science","scientific"
"cwueo3g","t3_3s4j5o","3s4j5o","science","scientific","I've read about this in the previous press releases, so two questions:

1.)  Electrolysis?  If you're welding dissimilar metals this way, aren't you going to have novel corrosion problems, particularly around electrolytes (salt water etc.)?

2.)  Innovation.  Is there any way for universities to do practical, applied work in process innovation?  They seem to avoid it like the plague.

I work at a competing institution (about six hours west, if it matters) in a slightly different field of engineering and practical work and innovation is sometimes compared with prostitution by P&T committees when compared with arcane publications and huge NIH/NSF grants - it's very frustrating.

"cwu1vyn","t3_3s4j5o","3s4j5o","science","scientific","I've worked in Aviation, particularly in jet engine manufacturing. I have a couple questions.

How does this method compare to inertia welding in terms of strength and weld formation? As you know, interia welding makes such a strong weld but as a process is very expensive due to the machinery.

Could this technique be used in ""Super Alloys"" such as Inconel and Rene? 

How large of a surface area can be done at once (Feasibly)? For something like aviation parts the need for a large weld with no defects is incredibly important.

What sort of surface finish and flatness do you generally need for this?  ","2015-11-09 14:00:22","2","Miuw202","1747605074.8913548","climate science","scientific"

As a current Electrical Engineering undergraduate student at OSU currently looking to do research, this is absolutely fascinating. As you said the U.S. doesn't do a very good job of implementing processing and manufacturing technology such as what you are researching on. Do you think this is caused by our country's attitude towards manufacturing? To me it seems like most people stop at the issue of outsourcing our manufacturing but fail to consider other solutions such as the innovation you do.

As you know robots have a much easier time manipulating large pieces of equipment like spot welders for more consistent and rapid welds which has led to tremendous process gains in manufacturing, especially automotive manufacturing.

My question is: Are you designing the process innovation around existing robots, or are you designing new robots to carry out these new innovative processes? 

Bonus question: I love robots but am not in a field related to them in any way. How do I get into building and programming robots? ","2015-11-09 15:43:21","2","[deleted]","1747605074.897676","climate science","scientific"
"cwu5lt1","t3_3s4j5o","3s4j5o","science","scientific","Thank you for taking your time to do this AMA. I am an Engineer that works with ASME pressure vessels and work with many of the methods you are currently researching. I have a few questions: 

FCAW has been permitted by Sec IX for many years. Equipment end users are just now coming around to permitting Flux Core for pressure boundary welds. Even after lengthy approval processes required by the ASME committee, it takes significant time to convince those buying equipment to use new process and procedures. Do you believe that there is an overabundance of caution for adding of new techniques by industry?

Do you work with groups such as ASME when doing your research? 

I am currently working on a project attempting to line a high pressure reactor with Hasteloy B3. This metal does not react well when explosively bonded clad materials are attempted (DMC/Noble clad will not supply). Weld overlay is cost prohibitive and roll clad is also unavailable. Does the vaporizing foil or laser impact method you are developing have any residual cracking issues with materials you have investigated?
