"cptua3n","t3_30lpjq","30lpjq","collapse","skeptical","One shouldn't expect too much from humanity. While our own culture likes to elevate us to god-like status, that makes it so much easier to cast as us demons or idiots when we fail to act responsibility.

The fact is that we're just animals who evolved to fit an environment which we no longer live in. When we over-exploit resources, we're simply following a million years of instincts that kept our ancestors alive and breeding.

It's impossible or wrong to blame a toddler who gets hold of a handgun for shooting up the house. In the same way, we may be the authors of our own destruction, but it was both inevitable and the result of a natural process, our own evolution.

The only way that this could have been avoided is either meddling with our genetic structure to edit out harmful instincts, or put us under the direct control of something without those instincts. ","2015-03-28 20:43:24","18","stumo","1747655420.4244401","IPCC report","scientific"
"cptnjl4","t3_30lpjq","30lpjq","collapse","skeptical","A reader of my website left this comment this morning:

Internet service was down for the last four days so I was doing some reading, “Mapping the Mind” by Rita Carter. I found this passage on p.42 to be in agreement with our conclusions: 

>“Our urge to rationalize behavior probably has considerable survival value. The human species got where it is largely by forming complex social constructs – from the hunting party to the political party – and making them work. To work they require that we have confidence in them and to have confidence we need to believe that the actions of these organizations are based on sound, rational judgements. At one level, of course, we know we are kidding ourselves. For example, all governments, in all societies, have some policies that are demonstrably irrational. However, no government member, anywhere, ever admits this – not at the time, anyway. Instead they rationalize their policy-making. We may see through it, but basically we like things this way – it makes us feel safe.”

So basically what we have is a subconsciously directed Homo erectus fossil fuel hunting party with the added capabilities of technology, without willfulness, with a wordsmithing module that tells us we’re doing the right thing and that God loves capitalism, F-150 trucks, war heroes, Coca-Cola, that humans are special, growth is good and that the technological singularity is just beyond the horizon. What’s to argue with there?","2015-03-28 16:58:01","4","xrm67","1747655420.428942","IPCC report","scientific"

>thanks for posting this mike. it helps me feel a little bit less crazy when others are willing to state/ see the obvious.

>so often i see my good ""green"" friends, bemoaning ""them"" (the republicans) who don't believe in agw, or how ""they"" (the government) should do something to fix the problems, or how i should vote for democrats or sign petitions. i think it is a way for ""normal people"" to obfuscate their responsibility, pretending they are victims... when we all know ""they"" will do nothing but try keep the status quo going as long as possible, because human behavior is simply non-negotiable.

>the cognitive dissonance is what is so absurd. it is like watching someone hitting themself in the head with a hammer, while complaining about how their head hurts. humans are insane.

>and yes, who said +2 C is ""safe"" when the maunder minimum's -.4 C caused the little ice age. 

>no, this will not end well... but since human behavior is non-negotiable, i just spend less and less time being concerned with the upcoming cliff, and more time focusing on how good life is now.

"cpu0wqf","t3_30lpjq","30lpjq","collapse","skeptical","Agreed, except for the Middle East jab. I never see anyone mention that, across the muslim world, there is an average of 45% inbreeding. With such a grossly deleterious genetic handicap, the muslim world was going to be poor, violent and backwards no matter what world it found itself in.

Thus, the Middle East being a clusterfuck is not a good indicator at all of global collapse.
