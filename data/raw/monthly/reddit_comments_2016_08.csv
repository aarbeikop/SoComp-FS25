Dr. Richardson: What is a genetic toolkit and how do you construct them? What do they allow you to do?


Dr. Singh: I was surprised when you mentioned that you work with models that are simple enough to be analyzed by hand. Do you struggle to balance robustness, complexity and accuracy? Could you give an example of one of your simplest and one of your most complex models? Do you have a favorite?

Dr. Pribram-Jones: My quick googling reveals that DFT is a quantum mechanical model. Are there special considerations you have to make in order to model quantum phenomenon using traditional (binary) computers? Also, what is a pseudo-molecule?","2016-08-18 17:16:56","6","PapaNachos","1747613456.427961","climate science","scientific"

1. Which came first, your interest in math and computer science or climatology?
2. What progress were you able to make in understanding Dansgaard-Oeschger events during your PhD?
3. What is your take on the differing reponses of the Arctic and Antarctic to anthropogenic GhG forcing? Do you see ozone loss over Antarctica as playing an important role?

"d6mtgzf","t3_4yd3p6","4yd3p6","science","scientific","Thanks for doing this AMA! I have a couple of questions about modeling.

How does one ensure rigor in computational and mathematical models? Are there general standards for ensuring rigor that work across different disciplines, or does it have to be subject-specific?

More generally, could you give a layperson-friendly description of how one goes about developing a novel computational or mathematical model? Where do you start? Is a computational model primarily a tool to transition into a mathematical one, or vice-versa, or do they each have their own uses?

"d6mtmhg","t3_4yd3p6","4yd3p6","science","scientific","@Hansi and Aurora: I'm an electrical engineer interested in optimizing computer architectures for various applications. What tools do you use for the computations you perform? NVIDI's CUDA seems like a good start, but I have a feeling that we could eventually develop even more application-specific computer architectures to allow for even faster execution of certain algorithms.

Have you studied how your algorithms are implemented in hardware? Are your problems structured in a data-parallel way that makes it easy to break them up for multiple processors? Have you found that there are bottlenecks to the computation you're currently using? Are there any features you'd like to see in future computing architectures (or languages / compilers)?","2016-08-18 17:03:45","3","jesterbuzzo","1747613456.442967","climate science","scientific"

      I am a grad student in computational chemistry. I am doing my second attempt for a doctorate. In my previous school I tried to develop a hybrid QM-MM method, but got negative results, which annoyed my previous advisor. How often do you see situations like this happen?

    Now I am doing more practical and applied research (still in computational chemistry) in Chicago. Now it seems that I can get a reasonable amount of publications. I just started in December. What are job prospects for PhD's in computational chemistry?

Finally, I have a disability. How do people with disabilities succeed in science? What are their employment prospects (i.e. would employers be interested in hiring people with disabilities)?","2016-08-18 21:07:21","3","vanrossum1","1747613456.446584","climate science","scientific"

As someone who has a basic grasp of how to to code, how would you suggest someone who is interested in applying/learning more about computational science go about learning more?
