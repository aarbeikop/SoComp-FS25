Models are useful tools. They're not right or wrong but more or less useful. Modern climate models do an extraordinary job of back-casting climate (a kind of ""predicting"" past observations). That, plus the fact that the model include all of the major climatic factors, leads us to think that they are useful for predicting future climate too. Also remember that climate models are for the most part global so they don't do a good job at making specific regional predictions. You have to switch models for that job.

Then they would respond to me with data (which always turned out to be false or misleading). We would go back and forth like this and never really resolve anything but to breed anger toward one another.

Then one day, my uncle was trying to tell me how climate change is not man-made. I took a different approach. I told him how my college roommate of 3 years was now a PhD student studying ice cores. His career has taken him from Greenland to the Antarctic. He has dedicated his life to this field of study. So, when you (my uncle) tell me that climate change is bogus, you're telling me that my close friend is either lying to me or incompetent. While that didn't change his mind on climate change, it did give him pause. I told him that if he actually knows of a researcher, personally, that has data disproving climate change and that researcher has had peer-reviewed papers on the subject, then I would be happy to reconsider my position. By taking the argument from being about competing data sets found on the internet, to making it personal (you're insulting my friend), it greatly improved the conversation. Now he asks me, 'what does your friend say about this?'

Could you talk a bit about ocean acidification.

I'm not sure if discussing OA as ""the other CO2"" problem is the best way of doing it, or not -- especially when a lot of tangible actions to combat it can be done at the regional/local level that can seem disconnected from the issue of global climate change.

What I always wondered about whether you can run climate models backwards in time? If it is feasible you can you 'hindcast' (as opposed to forecast) events like the ice age? Generally if you run climate models backwards do the models 'predict' what we know about past climate?

I am a grad student in a biology lab, but I would be very gad to know more about this topic, so please feel free to refer to academic papers that I can follow up:)

The thing is, if I were going to rack and stack possible reasons I'm not sure temperature swings would even crack the top five. I have seen everything in the hobby from people who perpetually keep their tank water far too hot, to accidental rapid temperature spikes and generally those don't end in a bleaching scenario. Too much / too bright of lights, incorrect chemical and trace element mixtures, impurities, and parasites almost always end up being the culprit. 

So this being the case, what data do you have to show that warming is a more likely cause than say man dumping pesticides into the ocean?  I completely agree what is happening must be man made, and I know global warming is real, but I honestly don't see how it is warming causing the bleaching. Surely it is more likely all the crap we dump in the oceans.
