My university environmental science professor believes that we can't prove climate change is human-caused, due to the fact that the earth's temperature has always fluctuated for thousands of years-- way before humans even existed.

"dda1qx3","t3_5rtksv","5rtksv","science","scientific","Hi Tom, and thank you for doing this AMA.

Growing up, I remember that a big environmental concern was human activity causing ozone depletion in our atmosphere, leading to the so-called 'ozone hole'. It was quite the concern, if I remember correctly. Luckily, strong environmental policy and research advocacy led to the enactment of legislation restricting the use of the chemicals that were causing ozone depletion. And, recent news studies suggest that this approach worked - the ozone layer appears to be 'healing'.

SO my question is, to what extent is this possible for climate change? If humans got serious about reducing CO2 emissions, would we see a similar 'healing' of the climate?","2017-02-03 13:35:43","62","SirT6","1747618904.6711428","climate science","scientific"
"dd9zy8x","t3_5rtksv","5rtksv","science","scientific","Let's talk habitat destruction, environmental awareness and the 'going green' movement in the context of eco-conscious consumer choices. The topic is diverse but I want to just focus specifically on free-range beef.

People want free-range because it is being marketed as being beneficial to the consumer in terms of healthy living, but it is also being marketed as being more 'green' because animals live happier lives. However I hear arguments that free-range farming may not be as environmentally friendly as it may appear.

Is free-range farming beneficial to natural ecosystems and the global environment in the face of both growing populations and growing popularity in free-range produce? Or is the land required for free-range farming more detrimental in terms of habitat destruction than factory farming? 

We should all consume less meat, but if we don't...of the meat that we do consume is it a choice between happy cows and happy natural ecosystems or is it feasibly sustainable to have both?

One of the things he talks about is the very efficient conversion of atmospheric carbon to soil-based, and so he concludes that many of the models we use to predict long-term impacts of climate change are skewed by a lack of complete knowledge.

It sounds like you are coming from the other side of the table - like 'don't look to us soil-types to pick up the extra carbon, because we are not using these resources in a sustainable fashion either'   but I am very curious to hear your take on his somewhat contrarian view

The problem is not climate change. It is something from classical physics. It is conservation of mass. You need to impress on people that we are not Gods, and we cannot create ore destroy matter, we can only change it. It is a law of physics and cannot be changed, bargained with, or ignored. To the non-science type that takes a cup of gasoline to his back yard, sets it on fire and burns it. He has destroyed it. But no he has only changed it. Now its atoms and molecules are floating through the earth's atmosphere they are still there. That is the real source of the increased temperature and the resulting climate change. Global warming is hard to convey when the resulting water cycle creates rain and snow storms to pump fresh water into the water flows in the ocean.  Climate is not precise. The conservation of mass is always and forever and cannot be changed, ever. So my question is why not lead the discussion away from the words climate and weather and toward the concept that we are not Gods and we cannot just burn things without them still being here.","2017-02-15 01:47:26","1","bluetiger0","1747619018.342962","climate science","scientific"

1. What percentage of your research is funded by government grants? Do you feel that you would have an equal chance of getting government funding to conduct research that had a hypothesis skeptical of climate change? 

2. How would you respond to people who argue that the margin of error in most recent NOAA publications is greater than the change in temperature from the past several years? Do you think it is appropriate to claim a year is the ""hottest year on record"" when the margin of error is greater than the temperature delta? 

3. How do you feel about the recent accusations that NOAA was changing temperature data to support their findings on climate change. How does this impact your assertion that scientists are generally ""honest""? Do you think funding has the potential to skew results?

4. Along the same lines, how do you respond to recent research that questions the possibility of attaining certainty in complex scientific disciplines as it ""...often doesn't eliminate uncertainties to the extent we might expect...due to a tendency to under-estimate the chance of significant abnormalities in results"" - David Bailey U of T professor department of physics. phys.org/news/2017-02-certainty-complex-scientific-unachievable-goal.html  Do you think there is any risk in touting the current state of climate science as unequivocal fact? Does it discourage an attitude of research and questioning which could ultimately lead to more knowledge? 

5. How do you respond to those that question the often quoted ""97% of climate scientists..."" stating that the study's findings were, in fact, that 97% of scientists who expressed an opinion on climate change were in support of man-made climate change? In other words, it didn't include those that published a paper that offered an inconclusive stance on human caused climate change.

1. How could this material improve the performance of solar panels? 
2. Could this be used to build a kind of ""superpanel"" that could use all three of those properties to gather electricity?","2017-02-22 13:01:08","3","Ras1018","1747619133.274241","climate science","scientific"

"de2ifaq","t3_5vieqm","5vieqm","science","scientific","Hello!

I recently signed all the paperwork to install a 5kWh solar array on my roof for ~$16,000. With the federal/local tax credits as well as my utility company's energy buy-back program, I am estimating to recover the full cost of the install within 4 years, and then be completely energy-bill free, and even come out net-positive most of the time.

My question is, with ever-evolving technology, is it still a good time to invest in solar panels for the home? Or are we on some sort of cusp of a major breakthrough in solar innovation that will dramatically reduce costs/increase efficiency within the next couple years?

My fear is that I'm buying into this solar array for my home based on the last of the ""old generation"" of solar, and there's this exciting new frontier of solar that may potentially be just around the corner.

Thank you in advance! :)","2017-02-22 16:03:18","3","crazyjay32","1747619133.281524","climate science","scientific"

"de2fwi3","t3_5vieqm","5vieqm","science","scientific","Hi Paul, 

First off, thanks for sharing with us - solar energy is the future and people need to be more aware of the technology!

My question is: How efficient is the standard solar panel? Is all of the sun's light converted into energy or is some of that light reflected off of the panel's surface?

Are there any models of solar panels that utilize mirrors(or some form of reflective material) to ""trap"" and intensify the amount of light? (Similar to how a person will use a mirror panel for tanning). I've only seen the simple flat design and was wondering what other designs there are. 

Thanks!","2017-02-22 15:12:54","2","mixedtaped","1747619133.289454","climate science","scientific"

Does an average solar panel produce enough energy to cover the construction of a new solar panel to replace the old one, while still producing industrially-significant amounts of additional energy for other purposes?

I'm a career firefighter in central New Jersey in our area we've seen a huge spike in solar panels which makes me extremely proud to be moving away from fossil fuels but it also creates a huge number of challenges for us. Through the research I've done it is nearly impossible to turn off solar panels themselves which hinders a huge part of our firefighting efforts, that being ventilation. We ventilate to release the smoke and heat from a structure increasing visibility for us and also increasing survivability to any victims. Breaking windows is a viable source of ventilation but that comes with its flaws as it isn't nearly as effective as being able to cut a hole one the roof and control where we want the smoke heat and fire to travel, as well as create a larger area to release these element rapidly. With the introduction of solar panels and new technologies I've seen such as solar panel shingles and windows, we become very limited in our abilities to extinguish the fire and protect the residents. We are able to disconnect the current from the panels to the house limiting our chances of electrocution but the panels themselves have been proven to conduct enough electricity through our hose streams to potentially kills us. I would like to see any information and more studies conducted alongside firefighters to get our input and educate us on how to handle solar panels more effectively or build them so they can be quickly shut down or removed  to aid us in our efforts.  With the construction trends of the past few decades, wooden trusses, wooden I beams, and now solar panels. We have less and less time to conduct interior attacks and searching for victims before the structure begins to collapse(I.e. 5 minutes in a truss constructed home) now with the added weight of panels, I fear we will be getting away from stopping homes from burning to the ground and not being able to search for victims. Again I would like to see more studies on how these technologies perform under fire conditions, what time frames do we have for collapse with the added weight on truss constructed roofs, can we devise a way to eliminate electrocution hazards from the panels, and can we design plans for quick removal of panels so we can remove them rapidly and work around them.","2017-02-22 19:19:35","2","BiggerBuckDown","1747619133.298101","climate science","scientific"

With all the advances in solar technology recently, I've had an idea for a backup that is made from a solar fabric perse, and less from traditional materials. Is this at all feasible in the near future? The idea being that mainly the top and back, outer areas most exposed to the sun when hiking, would be made of a solar 'film'. Possibly this film is just pliable enough to be used over a traditional backpack and feeds a battery placed inside of a pocket in the backpack.
