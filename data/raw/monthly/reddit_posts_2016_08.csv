"4yd3p6","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: We’re Sarah, Hansi and Aurora, postdocs at National Labs in the US. We each study a different flavor of computational science: computational genomics (Sarah), climate science (Hansi) and mathematical chemistry (Aurora). AUA!","Hi reddit!

I’m Sarah Richardson.  I specialize in the design of genomes and the creation of all the technological tools necessary to be able to write this sentence with a straight face. I work on massive scale synthetic biology projects (Sc2.0), the construction of genetic toolkits for non-model organisms (CRISPR for GMOs), and the reconciliation of computational genomics with experimental genomics (bioinformatics is not IT). All of which is to say, I am a germ wrangler who uses DNA to train microbes to do tricks.

I’m Hansi Singh. I will soon be joining the Atmospheric Sciences and Global Change Division at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) as a Linus Pauling Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow.  I research climate variability and change, with a focus on the polar regions.  One intriguing open question is why Arctic and Antarctic climates are responding so differently to anthropogenic forcing by greenhouse gases.  The tools I use run the gamut from global climate models run on supercomputers, to small heuristic models that can be analyzed with pencil and paper.  I am also interested in developing novel mathematical analysis methods for improved understanding of coupling in the climate system and global teleconnections.

I’m Aurora Pribram-Jones, and I tinker with electronic structure theory.  I build mathematical tools to investigate how well we describe electrons in metals and molecules. My interests lie in analyzing and developing density functional theory (DFT), one of the most popular computational methods in the world, and how it’s used for thermal ensembles.  Day to day, this means I get to interact with shock physicists, planetary modelers, and fusion scientists while imagining pseudo-molecules and drawing pictures.  My newest projects look at applications of DFT methods in other complicated systems: materials for hydrogen storage, high entropy alloys, and materials responding to lasers.

**We're signing off now, but will continue to answer questions where we can.  Keep an eye out here and at /u/TheGermWrangler.  Thanks for having us!**
