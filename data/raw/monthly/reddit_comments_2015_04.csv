In the developed world, members of the public get a lot of messages about lifestyle changes that we can make to lessen the destructive impact that our lives on the environment (e.g. recycling, buying locally grown foods, minimizing automobile usage, etc...). There doesn't seem to be a publicly understood picture of what an adequately environmentally responsible life might look like, though.

So the question is, how much is enough? What would the average lives and consumption patterns of all people need to look like in order for us to get to a sustainable state in which collectively, we are no longer pushing the world in the direction of environmental collapse?

Specifically, I lived in Berkeley, California for a short while, and my anecdotal impression was that the average person there was far more focused on living their life in an environmentally responsible manner than the average American, and often made lifestyle choices that were dramatically different from the average American out of that concern (growing much of their own food in large backyard gardens, not owning or driving cars, etc...). How close might the average Berkeley resident be to that ideal lifestyle, and how much further might we have to go?

Or, alternatively, is approaching the problem on the level of consumer choices asking the wrong question? Is it more the case that we as societies need to do the harder work of being involved on a mass level in consciously and intentionally changing some of the fundamental economic/social structures and systems that our societies are built on in order to reach an environmentally sustainable state? If so, what might that process look like, how might it gain momentum, and what might the restructured societal systems look like?","2015-04-17 19:34:01","2","Robin_Claassen","1747598276.8426518","climate science","scientific"
"cqfuxxs","t3_32ww7t","32ww7t","science","scientific","Years ago, I read an article that talked about the potential to make a huge dent in the carbon level in the atmosphere by changing around the practices of large scale farming.  The idea was that major agriculture sucks out a huge amount of carbon into plants every year, but then allows it to go right back in the air after harvest (or even forces it, by burning it).

On the other hand, if all the plant matter were instead buried, it would sequester the carbon, and even could be done in a way that lowered the need for commercial fertilizers and soil improvements. 

Governments could encourage this transition by creating incentives for the new approach, and that such a system would be far cheaper than other proposed methods.

It all sounded quite compelling at the time, but I've never heard another word about it.  Googling finds a bunch of discussion about much less feasible ideas of building new types of sequestration facilities to trap gas out of the air.    Plants already do this.

"cq7nf5v","t3_323yk3","323yk3","science","scientific","First off, the map graphic is very well done. Even though I consider myself knowledgeable on the subject, seeing the the graphic change for each question helped put in perspective how widespread each idea is. I have no doubt that if this graphic were distributed, it would have a global impact. So kudos on good work well done.

1. Is ""global warming"" to be used interchangeably with ""climate change""? The two imply subtly different ideas, with climate change typically including a broader range effects like oceanic acidification, and [this study, also in part by Dr. Leiserowitz, has shown people respond differently to each term.](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/global-warming-vs-climate-change/) Would you predict significant proportional changes in response or would you expect to see all figures rise or fall somewhat uniformly? 
2. I would consider rewording the response concerning beliefs among the scientific community to more directly imply that this is the public's beliefs concerning the scientific community's belief. At present it seems (to me) to convey that the data is the reported belief BY the scientific community rather than the population's perception OF the scientific community. [Another of Dr. Leiserowitz's studies demonstrates  up to 97% of the scientific papers published agree climate change is happening and human caused](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/scientific-and-public-perspectives-on-climate-change)
3. The ""already harming in the US"" question seems strange to me. I'm not sure how to answer that question. Smog in LA can potentially cause cancer or emphysema, but smog is a contributing factor to global warming rather than a result. Some studies have suggested certain marine ecosystems have been negatively affected by acidification but that's more of a climate change issue than specifically global warming. I'm not sure what present harm people could be citing when they say they believe it is presently harming us. Am I misinformed here, and something is presently affecting us negatively, or does this statistic demonstrate that, at least in some regard, general understanding of global warming is based out of fear rather than understanding? I understand also there are hugely dissenting theories on when we will begin to feel the effects of climate change.

I know I'm pushing it with a fourth question, but this is, in a sense, the most important. Do you believe we have a moral obligation to act in a certain consequence-conscious manner regarding issues of climate change? If we do have some obligation, how widely does it span? How could we justifiably act as individuals and as a world-community to sufficiently award praise and blame for actions with relevant consequences? (e.g. is it morally acceptable to reform industrial setting in a way which would be more difficult, stressful, or perhaps dangerous for human workers if emissions were significantly cut? Does diminishing the risk of an eventual potential global catastrophe (rising ocean levels, permanently destroyed ecosystems, specie-loss, up to eventual global extinction) justify the worsened human condition?

The strangest result is in the ""Most scientist think global warming is happening"" bit, where 34% actually perceive there to be a lot of disagreement. Gonna blame you News Networks...



On a whole though, it's actually quite positive, at least if ""Policy support"" polls are based of a strong opinion and not just a knee jerk reaction to the issue. Because even if people are not strongly in favor of the scientific literature, at least they don't mind actions against the issue itself.

2. Have you conducted any more detailed questioning of attitudes and knowledge of a subsample?

Can this tool be modified to also show ""Oppose"" answers to each question or perhaps the net of Support-Oppose?  The reason why this is important is because many of the question answers fall into the middle answer.  The carbon tax question for example is 44-25 Support-Oppose, which is quite good for proponents.  Looking at the map only for the Support value tends to give an incomplete picture of how Americans view the issue.
