"e9k21yf","t3_9w7cm0","9w7cm0","climatechange","action-oriented","Not a book, but this is the science, from the scientists themselves (sorta, the IPCC is a committee that reviews all of the literature, and provides a meta-level analysis of what everybody has to say). the [IPCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/) provides some of the most current and collectively vetted climate science literature available. Of note is that each publication is free to the public, and provides a [Summary for Policymakers](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf) at the start of every book. This 20-50 page synthesis is a ""for the public"" overview of the science, attached to a 1000+ page book of the actual science, and all of the citations and references you could ask for. The version linked above is from the [5th report](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/), the 6th is not yet available.

They recently released another publication, which is a bit more poignant and directed, titled [Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/), which also comes with a great [summary document](http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf).


The problem with a traditional ""book"" on climate change is they are outdated as soon as published. we are learning so fast, its hard to capture that outside of the peer-reviewed literature. A great book I suggest is [Reason in a Dark time](https://www.amazon.com/Reason-Dark-Time-Struggle-Against-ebook/dp/B00I7V0USG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542036176&sr=8-1&keywords=dark+times+climate). It does a great job of tracking the policy and actions/inactions of *how* we got where we are, and the book is rife with citations for every fact/tidbit he uses to justify his point of view. It is not about science so much as the policy, which I think is very pertinent this day in age. ","2018-11-12 15:24:38","3","grimwaldgaming","1747640316.9710422","climate science","scientific"
