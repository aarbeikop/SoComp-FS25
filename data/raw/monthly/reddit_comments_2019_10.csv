You'll find that most of these 'exorbitant bitcoin energy usage' claims usually aren't too genuine in how they present or measure the data. Then, of course it's never compared to the entire world's financial system for example, only compared to 'credit cards'. 

Think of, for instance, the hundreds of thousands of Loomis transport trucks shuffling money to and fro, everyday. Gas usage, oil usage, tire usage, etc. Think of the amount of energy it takes to make paper money (from planting crops, to harvesting, ink and other resource procurement, etc.), only to destroy it at the end of it's life. Think of the energy usage of all the financial centers, and server farms keeping that data nice and air conditioned. There's even people guarding money, and the server farms as well. This top-level comment details how a well-reputed crypto news site did a pretty in-depth review of the energy usage/wastage of the legacy system.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/c0t5xc/bitcoin_creates_as_much_co2_as_the_city_of_las/er7gpwp

So, we have to admit that our legacy system itself uses an extreme amount of energy. 

Bitcoin on the other hand (mining), is more profitable with the more energy you throw at it. For that very reason, a very large amount of miners are set up near renewable energy sources, where energy is abundant and cheap. Wouldn't you want the best return on your investment?

First of all, bitcoin and other cryptos are experimental technologies. Most experimental technologies are inefficient. I mean, nobody complains about how much energy the Large Hadron Collider wastes.

Second, bitcoin has already proven that it can successfully go through coin splits, so this kills the whole ""path dependency"" argument.

If bitcoin were ever to scale, it's unlikely that it would remain in its current form, IF the market desires a greener cryptocurrency. The market would select a bitcoin branch that breaks the current consensus and has a more efficient proof-of-work amount, ie. *just* enough proof-of-work to prevent double spending attacks, but no more. Or it would select a branch that replaces POW with POS entirely.

Third, this article doesn't dive deeply into economics of bitcoin mining. It fails to discuss negative energy prices for example, which occur in places like Germany with a high share of intermittent renewable energy sources. Intermittent negative energy prices are likely to become more and more common as the world switches from fossils to wind and solar. The world is going to *need* a place where it can dump large amounts of unwanted electricity during certain periods. Bitcoin miners are a perfect match. At some point it will become unprofitable to mine with anything other than negatively priced electricity.

TL;DR you can't extrapolate the current state of cryptos into the future. these technologies are still going to go through some drastic changes before they start to have an impact as significant as oil.","2019-10-08 20:41:37","-1","dieomama","1747651326.50536","climate science","scientific"

Mining tends towards the cheapest electricity sources.

A very significant portion of mining comes from the Chinese highlands. Chinese nerds with backpacks full of miners climb dozens of miles past the last roads, to build data centers out of bamboo racks and buckets of sand for fire extinguishers.
