"dh2nn82","t3_68zver","68zver","science","scientific","**The Study-** The shape and structure of 4,257 peoples' noses were recorded along with their local temperature/humidity levels. In order to confirm that nose morphology was population/genetically dependent, half of the participants had their genetic ancestry mapped and plotted against nose structure coefficients. For the other half, an estimation of their genetic ancestry was made based on the results of their nose analysis. Statistical analysis proved a relevant correlation.

**The Hypothesis-** As a function of the nose is to ""condition"" the air (clean, regulate temperature and dehumidify) we breath in, these authors thought nose evolution was perhaps forced by climatic factors.

**The Findings-** 1) Nose shape is more differentiated across different countries' populations than expected under genetic drift alone. 2) The width of the nostrils are correlated with temperature and absolute humidity (quantitative measure of water vapor in the air), but not with relative humidity (percentage water vapor content). 3) Other factors, such as sexual selection, are likely also a factor.","2017-05-03 13:25:28","114","HerbziKal","1747621793.337684","climate science","scientific"

I have had breathing issues for the biggest part of my life because my bone structure in my nose is really tight and it causes all kinds of issues. My mother had it and so did her sisters and mother, they all had surgery for it. I know quite a lot of people with similar issues where the slime can't flow out properly etc.

My question is however: is this just something that is evolved in a cruel way or does it serve a practical purpose? Or a bit of both?

While you've convinced me that something other than drift is at work, I'm finding the climatic adaptation hypothesis to be a bit too much to accept. For example, if it were true, I would then expect the morphologically  divergent W.African and South Asian samples (Fig 2) to also occupy climactic zones that are highly dissimilar; yet Fig 7 shows the W.African and South Asian climates to be very similar.

Could this selection on the nose just be an example of the [green beard effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-beard_effect)?  Basically, the nose is literally a central physical marker of genetic (and social) compatibility.  

I guess you could further investigate the climate adaptation hypothesis by looking at Native American populations. As a group they are genetically homogeneous and yet they also occupy a very large range of climatic and latitudinal zones (Arctic to the tropics).

"dh4dujg","t3_69722h","69722h","science","scientific","I've gotten really into the local birds lately. We have a nice variety in my neighborhood, but some Crows are moving in and now we're watching an ongoing turf war. 

It is my understanding that crows can drive other species out of an area, and I believe we're watching it happen. I am already seeing fewer of some species. (Our annual cardinal family has disappeared!) The mockingbirds have a perch that has become a battle zone - and almost every day I've seen as many as 3 at a time attack a crow for invading. 

My question(s): is there anything (humane) I can do to make the crows not want to move in? I hate to sound ""crowist,"" but frankly, their songs aren't as pretty as the birds they're pushing out. Could this possibly be a temporary home for them? Or should I just get used to the crows? 

It's the loss of the other birds that bothers me the most. And the mockingbirds can only do so much to keep the crows away. They're trying, but I wonder if it is futile. So is there anything I can do outside of watching the show?

This showed me a whole new world with conservation. I was originally looking to be a veterinarian (I am in undergrad), but this idea opened a ton of new doors for me to possibly choose. So my question is mainly about how does one get into conservation? What did you study in undergraduate as well as graduate (if applicable)? And what was your start in conservation and/or ornithology?

Then finally, as a conservationist, what is your view on trophy hunting and the like as a form of conservation? I know it doesn't apply as much to birds, but I'm still curious.

I really appreciate what all conservationists do for our world. And it is great that you are a teacher that can spread your views. Thank you.","2017-05-04 13:50:45","8","BriefcaseBunny","1747621915.453104","climate science","scientific"

There are two birds I have trouble identifying :
I've noticed every time I mow the lawn, these forked-tail birds swoop down all around me. 

They're brown on top and orange on the bottom. I don't think they're robins, because they look too small.

I'm an undergraduate student doing research with the Texas Parks and wildlife department studying bird populations on the gulf coast, and we've been noticing birds migrating a lot earlier in the last year or so, and we've also been seeing some species that are not really known in the southern range of the country. Do you think this has to do with climate change? Also we're studying the effects of man-made Marshes on Bird populations here in Texas and we seen a pretty consistent positive correlation between species abundance and species diversity with the number of man-made habitats. So I guess my follow-up question would be do you think if climate change is affecting the bird population negatively would man-made habitats be the key to helping mediate the crisis?","2017-05-04 13:55:41","3","MuricanTragedy5","1747621915.465581","climate science","scientific"
