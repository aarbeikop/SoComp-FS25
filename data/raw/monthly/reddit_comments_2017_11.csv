"dpmdvoi","t3_7c0fpz","7c0fpz","science","scientific","Crap I left my copy of the executive summary with my notes at the house!! I havent had a chance to read the entire report yet, im sorry!! Ill try to remember my questions...

First, how many models did you look at to determine the amount of projected warming without human interaction? We are still below maximum sea level before the last ice age, so would we expect an equal amount of sea level rise eventually in addition to the damage done anthropogenically? 

Also, a couple of the early figures in the summary refer to changes in earth temperature being iirc 1.8° F on average. Is that at the surface? Is that measured and interpolated across the surface or based on remote sensing methods?


This was by far the most thorough research ive seen. I skimmed through the references for a couple chapters of the report and the sheer volume of references is staggering. How long did your literature review process take?

Lastly, what is your go-to response to climate deniers? How can you possibly argue with someone who refuses to acknowledge the validity of science in general, not only climate science? The latter seems increasingly common nowadays.

Hopefully I can remember more questions I had and edit this post to reflect them later.  THANKS!

These people (sort of) have a point, in that you started with one model but needed to tweak it many times to fit the real world, instead of the other way around. 

I suppose a broad example would be that initially the World was predicted warm 4 degrees by some time, but then later it's only 2 degrees, and so on.

Sarah here to try and answer these collectively.... 
As climate scientists we don’t have the expertise needed to say what the best solutions are, either form a policy standpoint or a legal standpoint. Climate scientists can calculate what the climate impact will be of various policy solutions, but a lot more than that needs to be considered in deciding what’s the best policy solution. For sure we think the best current knowledge about climate change should inform these conversations. But in addition to this, experts are needed to determine the technical feasibility of different solutions, the risks associated with those solutions (vs continuing to burn fossil fuels), the economic and societal impacts (good and bad!) of different possible solutions… The final answers will also likely be based on what we as a society value and what risks we’re willing to take.

How long does it take you to collect a sample?

Do you have alot of the same team members that are normal oil and gas drillship does, such as mud engineers, LWD, or whatever else?

What do you do with the holes you drill?

What's the furthest offshore you could conceivably collect samples from?

Do you guys also collect sample data from cores that oil and gas drillship collect?

How's it going out there?","2017-11-06 12:33:15","6","DuskGideon","1747627609.9699252","climate science","scientific"
"dpf5178","t3_7b4g8u","7b4g8u","science","scientific","Can you see signs underwater of some of the major historic floods on earth? Especially the 11,000 yr old one that flash melted the mini ice age glaciers with the meteor strike in the upper north american plate?

Can you indentify the previous coastlines 400 ft below sealevel around the world?

Any signs of animal or human civilizations or habitates at former waters edge?


Edit:

Regarding this:
>Earth was experiencing an extreme greenhouse climate. During this time period, Antarctica had no ice cover and was actually attached to Australia. 

This seems counter intuitive. Wouldnt ocean levels have been higher if no icepack on antartica? Why would a land bridge exist or was it pre continental drift and unrelated to no ice?
