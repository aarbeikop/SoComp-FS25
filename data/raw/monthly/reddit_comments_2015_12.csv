1. In your opinion, are the results from the recent Paris talks a promising road to reduction in climate change or is it a backside-covering exercise by governments with no intention to of complying... or I guess is it both, depending on the government?
2. The IPCC has fairly consistently called for the need for nuclear power to reduce carbon emissions. Do you think the IPCC and climate scientists are being realistic here given the political opposition to nuclear power all over the world and the very conservative approach of the nuclear industry from a regulatory and technological perspective? I.e., can the world do what the IPCC is calling for?","2015-12-18 12:44:41","25","biledemon85","1747660850.415918","IPCC report","scientific"

I've read many of your pubs, but most recently your quantification of intensity for water consumption in energy production (with Spang et al.) Not surprising in that paper, you identified biofuels as being water intensive. I've worked a bit with some LCA studies for cellulosic biofuels (switchgrass, in particular, but I wasn't too impressed with the it's potential for anything). It seems to me your metrics could be valuable to life-cycle inventories addressing water consumption for biofuels. I digress.. on to my question. 

I'm wondering, since you're a chemist and have some prior work that I see in LCA, what is your true opinion of LCA as a tool in environmental science? I think it has it's place, but can be a bit weak. Will we ever be data-rich and have good enough quality data for it to be significantly valuable?

"cy3dr7k","t3_3xc5tg","3xc5tg","science","scientific","Hello Bill. Thanks for doing this AMA. Really glad to see dialogues like this taking place.

I have always been slightly confused as to why there is no sustainability/climate change equivalent to, for example, the World Health Organisation. I understand the role the IPCC plays, however, I feel it is primarily an advisory council rather than an active organisation which takes a hands-on role in promoting/advancing sustainability and climate change globally.

All I mean by this is it seems for most other global crises we are undergoing at the moment there is a recognisable/well-known/household name organisation to coordinate global efforts. For example, everyone knows the UN (global peace-keeping), or the WHO (for world health), or Amnesty International (fighting for human rights) or the Red Cross (for politically neutral humanitarian relief)/oxfam, or WWF (for animal conservation) - and even at a stretch the World Bank (aiming to reduce poverty), or Nato or G8 etc. etc. 

However for global sustainability or 'action against climate change' there doesn't seem to be similar coherent, commonly known organisation that tries to address all the issues involved and to make a concerted effort to produce change. The IPCC is great, don't get me wrong, it's just it doesn't really do anything other than inform other governments/the UN. I think we can all agree this is the slowest route to success, especially considering we require many different countries to agree on some level. The Red Cross or WWF or WHO take active roles in their fields, regardless (ideally) of political motivations/tensions by supplying funding to institutions/research/education, having accessible volunteer programmes for the public to engage with, raising awareness (by having a logo/organisation attached to the concept, particularly helpful for educating children in the long-term), having charity status, as well as all the informing of governments and looking at all the statistics etc. etc.

The IPCC is an organisation within the UN. Rather than an organisation in it's own right, with it's own policies and own motive. It is too driven by the UN and therefore means it has to bow to the member states rather than ploughing on through regardless like many other institutions I have mentioned above do in their respective fields.

I'm just surprised there's no World Environment Agency or something similar which is a household name. So I suppose my question is, why isn't there such an organisation? Or equally, is there one and I'm just being stupendously ignorant? :)
