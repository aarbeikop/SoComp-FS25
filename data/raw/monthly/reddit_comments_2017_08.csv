A worry I have about these PES-type programs is that they may disproportionately benefit landowners at the expense of laborers and other farmhands. That is, because the land owner is being paid to not clear the land for farming, there is now less employment opportunity within the community for non-landowners. Can you comment on the extent to which this played out in your study? How do you think it would impact PES programs if they wanted to scale-up, and have to include larger and larger farms.","2017-08-07 12:41:36","475","SirT6","1747624540.64199","climate science","scientific"

Because I know that UE started to give funds to Sicily's agricultural farmers (1000€/hectare) to boost this field, and that attracted non-farmers people to the agricultural business. That in Sicily usually means Mafia gangs, intimidating farmers to sell them their fields or illegally take over said lands and thus resulting in UE money boosting Sicily's Mafia.

For example, the US pays corn-growers to grow much more corn than the market actually demands.  As a result, corn is almost free.  Because it's cheaper than grasses, farmers discovered that it's cheaper to feed ruminants corn and then fill them with antibiotics when they run into trouble because they never evolved to be able to digest that corn.

In paying Ugandan land-owners to do nothing, could that have unintended consequences of its own down the road?  One example might be the [resource curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse) that frequently hits countries with a lot of oil.  For example, land owners no longer need labourers to cut down trees and no longer need charcoal dealers or woodcutters or carpenters to do things with the logs.  Those people no longer have jobs and can't pay teachers or doctors, so teachers and doctors leave...

Please consider answering my question because I think it is something integral to the claims of your study and something that people are overlooking. You said that the benefits were more than twice the costs of the program. Could you explain how you calculated the benefit of the delayed CO2 emissions?

Congratulations on the article, it's very strong and you address most of the possible sources of endogeneity that came to mind as I read.  I have some questions about land tenure.  I was surprised that, given that most land in Uganda (and SSA on the whole) is held under customary land tenure, you termed the subjects ""private forest owners.""  Did your survey ask respondents whether they have a title to their land?  I ask because of your counter-intuitive result that treated PFOs feel more secure about their ownership after the program; this runs against previous findings that suggest that clearing land for planting crops is a tactic used to secure land tenure when property rights are not well-defined or enforced.  I know you tried to make sure that participants did not select into the program based on anticipated future deforestation; do you worry they selected in based on pre-program strength of their property rights?  In other words, that only landowners who felt relatively secure in their land claims participated?  (Maybe this issue would not be a problem since it would be correlated with levels of anticipated deforestation?)

I wanted to know if growing indigenous crops/ farming symbiotically can help achieve the same results that you have shown. 

For example, in India the cash crops tends to be the leading cause of deforestation and imbalances the local ecosystems. Most of the cash crops are not endemic to India (corn, coffee, tea etc). They require large areas of lands and often use all the nutrients in the soil hence killing vegetation in the surrounding areas.  

If we were to grow crops that are indigenous to India (millets, sugarcane) along large tracts of forest land, do you see this as potentially benefitial?
