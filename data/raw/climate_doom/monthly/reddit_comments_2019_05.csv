Is he of the opinion that in a huge body of scientific work there should be zero flaws and uncertainty? That's absurd.","2019-05-01 01:30:43","2","j-solorzano","1747898884.334035","climate doom","manual"
"em7wvfa","t3_bjavvf","bjavvf","climatechange","action-oriented","You are, in fact, wrong. But it's not really your fault because that's what the news media has been hammering you with. People believe that the role of the news media is to inform. That's simply not true. The role of the media is to provide a platform for paid advertising. Every media outlet is out to make a profit, and the way to do that is to secure an audience and retain it. That means giving the audience what it wants. When it comes to climate stories, every normal event becomes a disaster because people like to read about disasters. 

Until the advent of yellow journalism there were few newspapers that made money because people did not care about the general news. But, give them a lurid story and they bought the paper and read the ads. AGW and all of it's related scary stuff is lurid content driving readership. Once a website has a following of concerned people it's not about to run a story about how they were incorrect in previous articles. That drives readers away and hurts profits. So, the propaganda aspect is about having an audience hooked and reeling them in on a daily basis.

The IPCC is a similar animal. It was created solely for the purpose of examining the evidence *in favour* of the AGW hypothesis. If it had found no evidence then it would have been disbanded and all of those people involved would have had to find less lucrative work. IPCC is a make-work program for UN diplomats and nothing more.","2019-05-01 12:45:44","1","there_ARE_watches","1747898884.340443","climate doom","manual"

"enmq9zd","t3_boyx0u","boyx0u","environment","emotional","It all stems from social issues. What makes these fuckers think it’s okay to destroy our earth? It’s the dominance that’s so prevalent in their society. These wealthy conglomerates are the product of endless generations of patriarchy, hierarchy. religion, capitalism, and plain old dominance over the fellow human. That domination of humans opens up the prospect of domination over nature, and that’s the mind frame that they’re wrapped in. The only thing that could change this is if we started banding together as communities and rejecting this dominance, establishing our own mind frame; a complete societal revolution. But of course due to the division inspired by the state and the wealthy, we’re still trapped in hating eachother based on economic status, race, sex, etc... I think ecological issues can only arise because of social issues. There was a time when our limited technology prevented us from impacting the environment on a massive scale, even though Kings and nobles still used their power for complete dominance over the people. With the development of the industrial revolution, the same people and the same problems that plagued old society were simply transmuted into the new industrial society. Now we have kings and nobles in the form of the state and the rich, and they exercise this power to dominate the people, destroy the environment, and endlessly grow, because due to that mind frame of dominance it becomes a feasible thing to do. Coupled with a top down state system that provides the mechanisms and threat of violence (police, military) to use that power wherever and however, and an economic system based purely on growth or death (capitalism), the motives behind the crisis become clear. We will reach a point of no return though, and maybe then people will realize that as a collective, we have to change the way we live and we have to change the way our society is controlled.","2019-05-15 15:51:58","3","[deleted]","1747898961.1099699","climate doom","manual"
"eno81qa","t3_boyx0u","boyx0u","environment","emotional","Well, a ban will result, but here is my take on this.

Pretend for a moment that tomorrow, all of the gas companies gave a press release and said ""Due to public outcry and the latest scientific data, we have decided to do the right thing for our future. As of right now, all gas production will halt. No more gas will be produced after today."".

Now imagine the coal industry did the same, along with the beef industry, fishing industry, agricultural industry, and every other major contributor that is blamed for this problem.

What would happen? Would people just nod and smile and say ""phew, we did it!"". How would you know the results after your electricity is shut off? How would you react to the knowledge that the supermarket wasn't going to be restocked in 3 days?

Everyone is so quick to point the fingers, but no one has any clue of what to do after they ""pull the plug"", so to speak.

Everyone is to blame, and no one is to blame. This is Rising Complexity in action. There are no solutions that don't have even greater consequences.","2019-05-15 21:32:56","2","[deleted]","1747898961.114254","climate doom","manual"
