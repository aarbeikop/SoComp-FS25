"5laam9","climate","scientific","Serious anxiety about the climate to the point that I'm considering suicide in the long term. Really scared. I need help, I need some glimmer of hope.","Hi all,

I made a throwaway account as my main account is one that my friends and family know about. I've dealt with anxiety for around eight years. I had full blown panic attacks over the thought of non-existence for about 9 months straight and eventually got a hold of it. They've come back over time, with one stretch being about a month long, but I've learned to somewhat manage it when it happens. I still, from time to time, grapple with the fear of death though.

Last year, I had about a week's worth of panic attacks and anxiety when I stumbled into a thread on /r/environment where someone asked how doomed we were. This absolutely wrecked me for about two weeks. I still don't know what made the pain and fear fade away, but it never really left my mind.

I became somewhat obsessive about the energy usage of myself and others to the point that I would watch a video of an activist interviewing someone and think ""the microphones are using fossil fuels right now."" Absolutely microscopic stuff. It didn't kill me, but it made me obsessive. I made changes in my life over the year - I've greatly reduced the amount of meat I eat (and I eat no red meat whatsoever now), changed out all of the lights to be LED, started to grow my own food, buy mostly local when I can, etc. I live in St. Louis, so biking and public transportation are not really great options here, but I have cut down on travel.

Fast forward to this week. I have the whole week off work, and had plans to finish a book I was reading, watch some movies, etc. I was alone in the house, and all of the sudden, for no real reason, my anxiety about the environment fired up really fast again, which has now lasted for about a week.

I'm 28 and I am absolutely terrified. I read things from people who are optimistic about climate change (Al Gore), to people who seem a little more in the middle (Bill McKibben, Eric Holthaus), to people who seem downright ready to be in the doomsday bunkers (Guy McPherson). I have always known that the situation wasn't great, but despite my personal belief that humans will survive, the idea of total collapse of our civilization by 2100 or before has crippled and paralyzed me. I feel absolutely helpless because the problem is so much bigger than myself and overwhelming. I'm a naturally pessimistic person, which makes me believe that humans won't change fast enough, no matter how much the rest of the world that cares about this does.

This has caused me to wonder why I should want to live in a world down the road that is headed towards total collapse. I am struggling to get out of bed. I have barely eaten. I feel like I'm the only one who sees this and is reacting appropriately. Even people who are on the front lines seem to somehow be able to live lives, which is even crazier when I consider that some of them have children, who will really see the brunt of this.

/r/climate, does anyone share these feelings or have gone through them before? What can I do to ease this? What hope do I have over this issue? I'm seeing a therapist later today, but I just needed to get this out there.

LYRICS (no idea why the formatting is so rubbish)

Arctic ice melting like Mr Whippy on a stove
Ocean life extinguished lightning fast like Messi facing goal
Night temperatures rising like the price of granary rolls
Psychopaths delight in buying shares in black gold

We’re Doomed
It’s on the horizon
We’re Doomed
I’m not just hypothesizing
We’re Doomed
Ignore hysterical deniers
We’re Doomed
Our future’s on fire

Paris climate talks took place at a time
when global temperatures were 1 degree above baseline
they agreed to limit rises to no more than 1.5
but they got a massive shock only months down the line
Unprecedented warming at an accelerating rate
February’s warning failed to reignite debate
Nobody’s talking, not even heads of state About the 
Mass extinction that is clearly underway

Species disappearing at a speed we’ve never seen
But Brexit fills magazines and the screens on our TVs
Starbucks Costa coffee cups fill our lands and seas between
Plankton replaced by plastic on which everything else feeds
Should we leave or should we stay is a trivial aside
From the real issue today which is how to survive
In a world with stagnant oceans in which everything has died
In a world submerged by high tides where remaining land is fried

Population explodes as ice caps recede
Freshwater under threat bringing society to its knees
Droughts starving farmland way more than we’ve ever seen
Trout, carp and salmon, sea horses disappear
We thought we had a century, or more to face our fears
more likely within twenty years the force of nature will be clear 
No sloths, bears or badgers, no plants birds or trees
no clocks chairs or tractors, no more humanity

We’re Doomed
It’s on the horizon
We’re Doomed
I’m not just hypothesizing
We’re Doomed
Ignore hysterical deniers
We’re Doomed
Our future’s on fire

Even those who know what is really going on Still got 
Toasters, phones, tablets, TVs turned on Still don’t
Stop and think about the impact that they’re having
And I’m the worst offender, just like you and all our families
We just can’t be trusted with products to consume
Democracy + media means America elects a fool
This leads me to one conclusion, its unfortunate but true
We need a global dictator, but one with benevolent views

A person versed in science, who’ll silence corporate news
Their military might only exercised to stop us lighting fossil fuels
once that’s all sorted just one thing to finally do
throw us all a solar panel and say good luck go find some food.
It’s not a happy future but let’s not be blind to the truth
the earth is changing faster than at any time. What can we do?
We’re all much too distracted, half of us dont even believe its true
While endless wealth is extracted from our addiction to dirty fuels
