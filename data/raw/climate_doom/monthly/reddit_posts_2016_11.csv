He seems to be in line with throwing climate change back into hyperdrive. Does anyone have any words of hope or anything?

"5cqzv1","environment","emotional","The best hope to get through to Trump on climate change is to petition his family.","Right now Trumps eldest children and Ivanka Trump's husband are part of Trumps transition team.  These actually seem like the most reasonable people in the group, specifically Ivanka Trump.  Couldn't we pick a good article on climate change and bombard them with social media just to read it?   Just to listen to the idea?  Maybe if we can get them to understand the severe consequences of climate change we could get them to at least try to influence policy.  

I was thinking something like ""Trump, the man who saves humanity or the man that dooms it."" attatch the article and just send this to all the members of his family on twitter and other forms of social media.  I feel if we get a big enough campaign going we might actually be heard before it's too late.   Any thoughts or ideas on how to do this and best implement it?

 Possible article. 
Edit 2:
https://twitter.com/trumphasachoice/status/797907567481495552  so I set up a twitter account and sent a tweet to ivanka trump. I suppose all you'd have to do is retweet.
