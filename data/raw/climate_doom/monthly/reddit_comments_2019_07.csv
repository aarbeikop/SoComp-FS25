  “A more fundamental problem with deadline-ism is that it might incite cynical, cry-wolf responses and undermine the credibility of climate science when an anticipated disaster does not happen.”

“The impacts of climate change are more likely to be intermittent, slow and gradual.”

  So I guess the challenge is to convince people that we need to act even though disaster may not be imminent.","2019-07-24 18:45:50","23","Bj231","1747900000.57542","climate doom","manual"

Reading this article and reading the above quote it makes it clear that this only a problem in countries that are legitimately concerned about doing something about climate change. This is clearly not the problem in the United States or the largest CO2 contributors. I would dream of someone seeing climate change creating an environment of political opportunism. Even the Democrats in this country seem unwilling to take up climate change as a problem that would necessitate the label of ""emergency"".

"eut5dcp","t3_ch927d","ch927d","climatechange","action-oriented","Well, call me pessimistic, but given the chaotic nature of our planetary systems and the rate of change seen over the last 50 years versus the previous 200 vs the previous 10000 etc. I am fairly confident that the evidence points to our being at the accelerating start of a logistics function taking us to the next strange attractor equilibria within our planetary system. (this is an educated hypothesis). No matter what we do now (this decade) we will see many of the consequences the ""doomers"" talk about; deglaciation, polar melt, more extreme weather, and loss of coastal land. We aren't destroying the planet, we're altering our environment. We will survive what we have done so far, but the longer we continue the more we risk passing a reasonably manageable strange attractor and ending up at a less manageable equilibria.

The tech exists today to start eliminating CO2 and CH4 production over the next 20-30 years and rebuilding/building sequestration solutions to remediate the damage done.

My estimate is it'll be 50 to 75 years before the barriers to solving global problems will be removed. So for me, the question isn't about deadlines, those are ridiculously difficult to guess, let alone defend, in systems as complex as the planetary ecosystem. The question is how much equalibria delta can we avoid by trimming years off the turn around time (likely 75 years)

Something everyone should also realize, If we stopped using fossil fuels altogether next year and started aggressively planting trees and seeding oceans, we would still have 50+ years minimum to see planetary systems start returning to pre-industrial levels and probably 200 or more for stability at or near where we ""should"" be.

Deadlines in this world are measured in centuries with a margin of error of decades. The time to stop burning and polluting was over 50 years ago (probably closer to 100). The time to fix things has been NOW for almost that long and will be NOW until we either do it, or decide that Venus isn't so bad and we should emulate it.","2019-07-25 02:03:20","10","CleanEnergyFunding","1747900000.586663","climate doom","manual"

"etcn4n8","t3_cb032g","cb032g","collapse","skeptical","Hello dear subreddit and OP,

I agree with you, the public needs to be shocked into action. Climate change should be the first thought on their minds everyday.

I have been following this sub for a few months now to do just that for myself. I have also started writing a book about living in a dystopian future post collapse. Just like 1984 warned us of the dangers of totalitarianism while the USSR was still standing, I wish to write a book that warns us of the future we reserve to mankind by not trying our best to stop climate change. I am aware that the train of global warming has long since left the station and is going at great speed towards our global extinction. Yes, I know that even by trying our best, my grandchildren will have to face terrible consequences. Heat death, wildfires, increasing millions of climate refugees, sea level rise, and of course the collapse of many states as a result. Perhaps of all modern society.

Yet this is precisely why I wish to write this book now. Not later or never. I want to create an entertaining piece of fiction containing the facts of more serious and scientific works and make it all digestible for anyone on this planet. To do so, I shall present a believable, and downright terrifying vista of a future where climate change was ignored and we just kept course to annihilation. I want to panic the world into action. And shame our irresponsible leaders in the process. Just like a certain Karl Marx once did with a little manifesto...

But for that...I am going to need your help.

While I know where my story and characters are going, as well as the themes I shall explore, I also wish to draw an hypothetical map of what earth would look like in a few centuries (I settled for the 27th). I am currently drawing new coastlines for Europe after a 70 miles sea level rise (not the highest estimate, I know). But I would love to do it for the entire world as well. And take into account the drastic consequences of increased temperatures on the landscape of Europe. Arid Alps, the disappearance of snow...and so on. But to make a map of this ambition I would need your help.

I have started my research, and am currently reading ""The uninhabitable earth"" for inspiration. However, this sub has a wealth of information and resources that would greatly speed up this process.

Likewise, if you could help me draw the map of this ""Broken World"", the title of the book, then I am certain the final result would be far superior than if I did it on my own. (Turns out google has a create map option that can be worked on by multiple google accounts just like a google doc).

To summarise this call to action, and I hope you'll forgive me for the length, I ask of this subreddit:
-volunteers to look for information about the consequences of climate change from trustworthy sources, in parallel to my own research,
-volunteers to draw a map online of this new and broken world,
-to share its enthusiasm, as your servitor continues to consistently write every day (already 40 pages done in a month, the book should be around 200).

Whether I manage to convince you or not, thank you for reading to the end.

"etd4aw4","t3_cb032g","cb032g","collapse","skeptical","I have to be honest with you, I constantly think about the same thing whenever I feel like the world around me is falling apart. It's not an easy pill to swallow, and nobody blames you for hating the experience the entire way down. Take my advice with a heaping amount of salt, because not everything works for everybody. In order to combat this feeling of hopelessness, I just remember that I'm lucky to be here at all, and that the universe doesn't owe me an explanation. 

It's extremely easy to get swept up in the current of ""collapse is on the horizon"", or ""collapse is here"", because those are immediate things that play into your existence in the here and now. It's scary, and a lot of people cope in many ways. Some just don't give a shit, others try to not look worried about it, and some people just aren't well informed enough to let it worry them. Me? Well, the chances of me existing in the first place were minimal, and I was born anyways. Some people think birth condemns them to constant suffering, which in some cases is pretty true, but I choose of my own free will to look at the bigger picture.

This universe is much bigger than us, and I don't mean just in the comparison of size, but I actually mean in the comparison of importance. Millions of years of trial and error brought us to this point, and we got a ""chance"", or more correctly an ""opportunity"". We can choose whether or not we want to check out early, or persevere through all of the bullshit until the universe decides it's time for us to leave. A lot of that bullshit is stuff that you are incapable of controlling, and it can get extremely depressing, but remember when I was talking about certain types of people? That applies to this. Things can only change when a majority of those around us are well informed of the issue, and hellbent on fixing the problem, but the issue with that, is you have to get all people to cooperate, put aside petty differences, and solve a global issue. 

I suppose it is pretty rough to think about all of this, and having the ""what if's"" jumbling around in your head probably doesn't help either. Do your part in helping the planet (biking or walking to where you need to go, refrain from using single use plastics, compost, learn how to garden, keep up on a few plants around your place, do your best to not waste water, change your diet to include more vegetables, and less meat, etc.) and make sure that you yourself aren't living a hypocritical lifestyle. Realize that you can't make people do anything, and that they will only do what they want to in the end. I know it's frustrating, but that's the way it has to be, otherwise you are infringing on the rights of others. 

   Even if you do all of those things correctly, the inevitable end will probably still come, but you can rest knowing that you did everything you possibly could. So, I guess if I had to what my advice is, it's that you need to just live your life. Do what you want to do, and what makes you happy, because nothing even guarantees you are going to live long enough to see the collapse. People die every day from random accidents, or disease, and nobody can change that. When you wake up in the morning, instead of hating that cold breeze, just take a second to enjoy it, as if it's the last time you are ever going to feel it. Spend time with the people you care about, and try not to leave any loose ends in your life. The nice thing about knowing the end of the world could be near, is that you know you still have time to make the most of your existence. 

   We are not immortal beings, and our lives are very short. We don't know what happens to us when we die, but that doesn't mean I need to spend my entire life being afraid of it. Murphy's Law: what can happen, will happen. Just be you, and enjoy the existence you have been given. Or tell me that I'm an asshole.

Of course, climate-driven political breakdowns have already occurred in various warmer places, like Sudan, in the 20th century.

I just don't know whether we're talking 10-20 years or 2-3 before things get bad for Westen/Northern Europe and North America. I'm really worried about what's happening in India. It's tragic for those involved, and a scary sign that mass migration may soon be significantly affecting European countries.

Obviously I'm not expecting it all to happen right away (As many have pointed out here, collapse will likely be unsteady, uneven and unequal), but one way or another I'm likely to be one of the ones to bear witness to the slow decline of society over the course of my lifetime.
