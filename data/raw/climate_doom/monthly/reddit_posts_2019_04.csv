"bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","Anxiety, Annihilation, and You: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Collapse","The Collapse is inevitable and no one is doing anything about it, right? You know the solution, the answer to our problems that would turn it all around, if only people would just listen! Sustainable lifestyles, Geoengineering, better food distribution, Communist uprising, going green in '19, *not buying a new damn cell phone when a used one is just as good and the heavy metals involved are* blah blah blah...

News flash buddy, **it isn't going to happen**. I'm sorry, I wish it wasn't true, but it is. We've all seen the headlines, read the news articles. It's out of our hands now. The corporations and governments of the world are the ones who started this thing, and they're the only ones able to stop it, let alone turn it around. We all know the likelihood of that happening. 

This makes you anxious. Scared. Depressed. Suicidal even. If the end of the world is inevitable, why even bother, right? Stop. Take a second. Relax. Breathe. Even the most pessimistic projections give us a decade, and most scientists agree it's going to be 20 or so years before things get really bad.

Look, competing with each other over who can make the biggest drop in the bucket isn't doing anyone any good. You can't save the world by recycling and going vegan, and no CEO or politician would ever care to hear what you have to say, but you can still save yourselves. Anxiety and depression both stem from the same source: **Hopelessness**. A feeling of being unable to make a change or difference. Anxiety and depression are gifts from mother nature. Evolution has given us this primal fear, this deep-seated unsettling discomfort when faced with an issue. You just have to turn it into action. 

We're in a unique situation on this subreddit because we know what's coming. We've opened our eyes. When Miami is sinking, when LA is engulfed in fire, when a hurricane is knocking on the gates of the NYC sea wall, it will be far too late to act. So act now. Acquire skills while you still can. 

* You're a scared 18 year old who wonders why college matters anymore, or you're worried that you'll be left with a useless degree? Become a nurse, a doctor, an EMT. Go into the trades; carpentry, HVAC, electrical. Become a Water Resource Engineer. Get your degree in Sustainable Agriculture. Become a climate scientist yourself. I guarantee you the jobs I just mentioned will only become more valuable when shit gets hot.

* You already have a job or a career? Buy cheap land while the getting is good. Learn how to grow and preserve food there, or what animals are native and how to track them. Best case scenario: science was wrong and the climate doesn't get too bad, or maybe against all odds humanity pulls together and saves the planet. Now you have a nice ranch home in Colorado, or a nifty hunting cabin in Michigan. Worst case scenario: things get as bad as they say it will, and now you're way ahead of the people waiting in line for water in New Mexico. 

* *At the very least* start stockpiling food and water. Even just setting aside a few dollars for extra rice and beans every month or another gallon of water puts you in a much better position when things start going downhill. When you're better situated, acquire more skills. Learn to fix your car. Buy a gun. Take a survival course, or a martial arts class. Start a garden. You don't need to go full doomsday prepper here. Most of this shit could fit right into a normal persons' life. You just happen to have some perspective about the whole thing.

The point is to prepare. **Act**. Do something, *anything*, to improve your position, because sitting on reddit reading about how shit things are is not doing wonders for your mental or physical health. Use that anxiety, that fear, and turn it into a productive force. I promise you that even baby-steps towards progress will go a long way towards feeling better.

And for those of you that say there's no point, or that they don't want to live in a world where things are as bad as science is saying it can get? I promise you that you're wrong. The human drive to survive is powerful, so powerful in fact that I can practically guarantee you that you will still be hanging around with us when the SHTF. The question is do you want to be sitting in a refugee center in Phoenix, or dying of heatstroke in Houston? Or do you want to prepare now and be working your quiet farm in Oregon, hearing about these things over the radio? 

If you read this whole thing, thank you. I hope I can inspire even one person to act, or to be less anxious at the least. If I do, I'll be glad I wrote it. 

TLDR: Doom and gloom isn't helping anyone, you can't change anything, but you can act to improve your own circumstances.
