I am a climate scientist so I hear from many of my students and friends about their own, and more recently about their teenager’s, climate anxiety. I first felt climate anxiety some 20+ years ago when I first started to study climate science in grad school. I feel sympathy for folks who are newly realizing the depths of the climate crisis we are in. Media and education institutions have failed the public with their climate silence.","2019-06-25 05:47:04","3","huprice","1747899450.409975","climate doom","manual"

Probably does more to push people away from the eco movement than it does to encourage people to help. What’s the point in trying to clean up the pollution if *we’re all doomed* anyway?

The climate as we know it may be changing, and it may present a huge existential challenge for humanity in the generations to come, but there’s no science that proves humanity incapable of overcoming this challenge. We might figure out a way to survive, or even to thrive, in this new world.

We are very likely making this new world much more difficult for our descendants, though. Especially the poorest and most vulnerable. And that’s very sad and unjust.","2019-06-03 23:15:29","6","xtivhpbpj","1747899524.504242","climate doom","manual"

"epy9fp3","t3_bwh3zf","bwh3zf","environment","emotional","I am one of the people who think that the forces that are set in motion right now are likely to lead to the worst-case scenarios I have seen from predictions from climate scientists. the conventional wisdom holds that the curve we're on will lead to sea level rise and some other issues but that's it's not going to be that bad. but the latest data coming in suggests that the process is accelerating so rapidly that the models have to be thrown out because things are going to change much faster than predicted. and it's going to be much worse.

but having said that I think anything we do now will at least mitigate some of the damage later. it's better to do something than nothing, but that something needs to begin at the top. the suggestions I'm seeing put the onus on individuals and not on the large organizations that can actually create the most change the fastest.","2019-06-04 04:55:18","5","RadOwl","1747899524.509396","climate doom","manual"

"epxwutu","t3_bwh3zf","bwh3zf","environment","emotional","I don’t think climate change is going to cause our extinction—for the past 2 million years we’ve managed to survive a lot of severe climate change. Could it cause global chaos, kill hundreds of millions if not a few billion people, and maybe knock us back a few civilization notches if we don’t start making serious changes? Maybe. Historically we tend to reach civilization high points, exhaust our resources or corrupt our systems, and then descend into a dark age. If it can happen to Rome, Egypt, the Maya, then it can happen to us, and climate change could easily be a catalyst for that.","2019-06-04 01:49:56","2","05-wierdfishes","1747899524.51499","climate doom","manual"
"epygxw4","t3_bwh3zf","bwh3zf","environment","emotional","climate change is not a binary thing. It isn't yes or no, it's a spectrum. It's just a matter of how bad it is going to get. So from that perspective, anything we can do to limit greenhouse gas emissions helps. Also, geoengineering is a possibility as well, so we could soften or even reverse some of the effects that way. So no, I wouldn't say we're doomed.

also it might just be semantics, but I disagree with the phrasing of ""saving the planet"". Hot or cold, earth will soldier on. Climate will change, some species will go exctinct, but the ocean will still be there, the land will still be there, and over time life on earth will evolve and adapt and thrive just like it always does. I'm more concerned how this affects humans.","2019-06-04 07:41:22","3","aphel_ion","1747899524.5172732","climate doom","manual"

"epxov63","t3_bwh3zf","bwh3zf","environment","emotional","Doomsayers are probably right, but it’s not helpful to start from a defeatist standpoint since it just demotivates people.

The challenge is getting the population and its governments to take the threat seriously, which is *really hard* because it’s happening in a system above the scale our brains are designed to handle (we can imagine a whole tornado or a predator-prey relationship, but not a whole hurricane or ecosystem). That means it’s kind of too big for our brains to treat as a real, practical concern. It’s above our cognitive pay grade.

We also, for a lot of reasons both evolutionary and cultural, are as a species really bad at taking something seriously until it’s almost too late. So to get people to act, we sort of have to have an “oh crap save me jesus” moment, which happens *after* we start feeling the pain of a problem. The bigger the scale, the more of us have to feel it before we reach a tipping point and begin to respond at sufficient scale. 

Attempts to induce that reaction earlier on tend to look like (and often are) fear-mongering and doomsaying, and they tend not to accomplish much, but the underlying intent may be good. Planning a large-scale intervention is, uh, challenging.","2019-06-04 00:05:32","1","SystematicInsight","1747899524.52246","climate doom","manual"
