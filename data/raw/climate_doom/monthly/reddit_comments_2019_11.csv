Sure

>the great holocene glacier retreat was 12,000 years ago

Yes, and?

>We have been warming ever since

No. After a warming trend in the Early Holocene (11,300 yr B.P.), global temperatures plateaued from 9500 to 5500 yr B.P., and then experienced a cooling trend ending \~100 yr B.P..^(1,2,3)

>There have been five global warming events over the last 2 billion years.  They are short, about 10,000 years,

What precisely is a ""global warming event?"" Considering the conspicuous choice of ""five,"" I can only guess it refers to the typical five ""Ice Ages,"" which are being confused with ""Glacial periods."" Ice ages typically span tens to hundreds of millions of years. Glacial periods span tens of thousands of years. Within any one Ice Age, or icehouse Earth, there may be upwards of thousands of glacials, and interglacials. According to these two claims either there have been five Ice Ages, and the Earth is 50,000 years old. Or there have only been five glacial periods in Earth's history. Both claims are absurd and demonstrate a basic failure to understand the climate system.

>Atmospheric carbon levels are now 400 ppm (a tiny trace amount) - at the end of the last glacial period levels fell to 180 ppm and 80% of the large animals on earth became extinct

Side-by-side these two claims produce an amusing internal logical inconsistency. Somehow the carbon content of the atmosphere is simultaneously ""tiny"" (with the implication that it therefore cannot have significant consequences), yet its reduction is then claimed to be the sole cause for a mass extinction event. In actuality evidence suggests that it was the emergence of human competition, and hunting, with climate playing a minor role.^(4,5)

>Atmospheric carbon levels much lower than that will result in the extinction of all life on earth

Literally no one is suggesting we reduce atmospheric CO2 to levels which would produce an artificial glacial period. The goal of decarbonization is a return to pre-industrial levels, not to plunge us into Snowball Earth.

>Two million years ago, during the miocene atmospheric carbon concentrations we 4000 ppm - Ten times that of levels today - but the average global temperature was only seven degrees higher than today.

This claim is an outright fabrication. In actuality the CO2 concentrations of the Miocene were around \~600 ppm.^(6) There is a good correlation between changes in atmospheric CO2 during the Miocene and ecological changes.^(6) The global mean air temperature anomaly never surpassed three degrees Celsius compared to present day.^(6) Mechanisms that lead to the change in CO2 concentrations during the Miocene have been discussed at length.^(7,8,9)

>What the miocene is known for is the explosion of complex life forms not their extinction.

Coupled with the reference to 4000 ppm CO2, I assume this is mistakenly in reference to either the Cambrian explosion or else the Ordovician radiation. (Only off by >400 million years!) In any case there have been plenty of refutations of this specific claim. So I will simply leave you with this one.^(10)

>People who don't agree that man is the cause of any significant contribution of global warming/interglacial period don't falsify data to make their point

As far as the implication goes, citation required.

>did you hear the recent news that your so-called scientist who developed the ""famous"" hockey curve graph...

This refers to Mann v. Ball a civil defamation lawsuit. Despite parroted claims to the contrary by the ""skeptical"" blogosphere, the decision was not made on account of failure by Mann to produce data. It was made because Ball is in poor health, and the lawsuit has stretched on for nearly a decade.^(11) Incidentally, the judiciary does not dictate scientific evidence, nor do ad hominen attacks against Michael Mann. Even if one were to accept the bogus attacks on Mann's work a casual glance at the most recent ensembles of temperature reconstructions of the same period will reveal quite a hockey stick shape.^(12)

>I'm sure you can tell us non believers what the optimum temperature of the earth is

There is no optimum temperature of Earth because Earth does not have the ability to care about its surface temperature, or anything. A better question is what is an optimal temperature for human prosperity on Earth. That answer is quite clear, our optimal temperature is the one which sustains the climate which we naturally and artificially adapted to. Deviations from our current climate state will produce increasing damages to our ecology, the diversity of extant flora and fauna, and in the case of total failure to mitigate climate change over a sufficient period of time, an existential threat to human civilization as we know it.

did you hear the recent news that your so-called scientist who developed the ""famous"" hockey curve graph...

Richard Mueller was a climate change denier and he hired a team of scientists under The Best Project to review the 1.2 billion data points to prove that climate change was a hoax. He finally came out and said something like ""Yes, we have proven climate change to be a fact"" to which the scientific community responded something like ""No shit Sherlock, that's what we have been trying to tell you.""

As for your questions about CO2 concentrations and Earth's development and temperature here is the CO2 History of the Earth to the best of our current understandings. This is one of my favorite presentations. I love at the end where they show a picture of the Grand Canyon to show the layers that CO2 created.
