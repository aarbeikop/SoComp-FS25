You should still consider getting off the western autopilot life script, though, assuming you’re on it.  

Rural Central American farmers, most Bangladeshi folk, polar and sub-polar First Nations, and low-lying pacific island nations? Now they’re profoundly screwed. Climate destabilization doesn’t apply uniformly across places and peoples.

"e6700hr","t3_9guw7p","9guw7p","climatechange","action-oriented","I love this question, because I think it's reasonably easy to answer even though many people will find the answer shocking.

The endgame — for the second half of the 21st century, let's say — is:

* Global economic growth will slowly converge with its historical average

* Technology advances will continue to accelerate mildly 

* These trends will continue to be partially obscured by exogenous shocks of varying disruptiveness. 

This growth convergence has been going on in wealthy countries since probably 1990 or so. The US has been a notable outlier for a while, although even that convergence probably started around 2008 (we'll have a better view by 2025).

The technology acceleration probably doesn't need to be highlighted to anybody who was born in the 20th century. It's likely that in the future more basic research will be private/corporate-funded instead of publicly funded, which may mean that it disseminates somewhat less quickly but gets applied to market solutions more readily.

The exogenous shocks in the 20th century were primarily wars and occasionally natural disasters. That pattern will probably continue through the 21st century, although the two elements might change places: Increasingly common natural disasters might wind up being more disruptive than (decreasingly-frequent) wars. 

(Although I don't want to speculate about a possible change in warfare in the 21st century, such as moving to biological battlegrounds. That stuff is for real doomsday theorists, not me.)

In short, the likeliest outcome is that current trends will continue: Economic growth, regular technological advances, occasional exogenous shocks. Climate change isn't one of the top hundred things that might kill you. Exogenous shocks are possible and worth keeping an eye on (infectious diseases, warfare, crime) — but the most potentially deadly things in your life are almost certainly your personal habits: If you avoid substances and risky behavior; eat meat, sugar and carbs in moderation; and reside and seek appropriate medical care in a First World country, then your chances of living long enough to fully fund and then empty your retirement account are extremely good. Probably better than ever before in history.","2018-09-18 14:16:30","6","DocHarford","1747888979.778526","climate doom","manual"
"e670dim","t3_9guw7p","9guw7p","climatechange","action-oriented","Really it depends on the timescale you're talking. I think we will begin to shift away from fossil fuels, especially as the effects of 1°C become more apparent. If we can get to carbon free by 2050-2075 i think we'll be ok.

> Do you think human extinction is the likeliest outcome of climate change?

Based on climate change alone, definitely not. I doubt that's even possible, let alone likely. At six degrees of warming (we're currently at ~1°C), then heatwaves with deadly wet bulb temperatures will strike places like India and Pakistan, so were not even close to a point where temperature alone can render the earth uninhabitable. If there were a nuclear war due to resource conflicts, then *maybe*, but I still think that's unlikely.  

> Will I die because of climate change?


I doubt it. If we make serious progress in cutting carbon emissions and can get carbon free before the later stages of the century, then we could well limit warming to under 3°C. Obviously, warming will make life more complicated. We will have to plan for possible food shortages and more intense droughts, and also on how to cope with rising sea levels, particularly for large coastal cities and Bangladesh, but we have decades at hand. However, we do need to start taking it seriously *now*, in order to limit our problems in the future.","2018-09-18 14:22:01","4","[deleted]","1747888979.7812722","climate doom","manual"

"e68mf0u","t3_9guw7p","9guw7p","climatechange","action-oriented","This is a good question. 

Up to this point, climate change has been an example of the Tragedy of the Commons. We've been using the atmosphere as a free dumping ground for the greenhouse gas waste product of our economies. We are really at the early stages of bumping into the global recognition of the cost of the historical approach.

Using CO2 as the proxy for GHG's, we've gone from 280 ppm to 410 ppm since the industrial era began. Due to the 30-40 year lag period involved in warming the ocean mass and the Great Acceleration since WWII, we're probably experiencing something along the lines of 350-375ppm today and will get to at least 500 ppm before we can wean ourselves off of fossil fuels. 

Since CO2 impact is logarithmic, it would be useful to consider that humans have evolved in a CO2 range of ~ 2^7th ppm and 2^8th ppm and are en route to 2^9th ppm. The CO2 in the air is halfway from level 8 to level 9, but the warming is only about a quarter of the way there. 

The observable impacts to date demonstrate a troubling sensitivity en route to level 9. At level 7.0, we have paleo evidence that New York and Boston are covered in ice a mile high. We should expect nothing less transformative as a result of the equilibrium associated with level 9.0. 

The biggest unknown is our ability to implement CO2 sequestration. Some promise has been shown with that experimentally, but the current cost at $100-$200 per ton is prohibitive at the moment and only a global socialist undertaking would make that a reality. 

Ultimately, sea level rise is going to result in the forced migration of hundreds of millions of people around the world. The inflection point for action is going to be when the world internalizes the inevitability of this outcome. I'd say that we're no more than 20 years from that reckoning. 

Governing paradigms will need to change as we will be going on a war footing to survive. This era of government in the US where the legislative branch does almost nothing will have to end. The private sector can't solve this.

While humans have historically been very resilient, we are uniquely vulnerable relative to the past in terms of our increasing global inter-dependency. Most people are dependent upon supply chains for food that aren't within their sphere of control. Shocks to those supply chains could set off levels of unrest that could quickly spiral out of control. 

Tougher times are ahead. An earth with CO2 at 300 ppm is worth a lot more to humans than one at 500 ppm. There's a big bubble to be popped.

"e6bmtb8","t3_9guw7p","9guw7p","climatechange","action-oriented","> What I'm asking is if all the changes we will make in the future will be enough.

No, we are late already and, even in the most optimistic models, we are lying to ourselves, thinking that somehow someone else will fix the problem in some fatalistically(as in ""written in fate"") sci-fi future. The 2C IPCC scenario it's already difficult to believe and even that includes the rise of negative emission technologies that are now not existent/not scalable.

We are essentially procrastinating as a species, favoring today ""pleasure"" at the expense of tomorrow demise for the simple reason that we are used to our comfort and the alternative is ideologically unacceptable on top on being complicated to explain and almost impossible to organize.

> Do you think human extinction is the likeliest outcome of climate change?

Homo sapiens will survive in pockets of fertile land near nonsaline bodies of water.

The civilization as you see it today will stop existing in 100/200 years. 

> Will I die because of climate change?

Highly unlikely; you will, depending on your current situation, see some aspect of your life decreasing in quality, but overall you will die having lived a lesser form of the life that you were expecting before looking into this topic.
