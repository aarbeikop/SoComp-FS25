"e1gzo76","t3_8uo4s7","8uo4s7","collapse","skeptical","I did the same thing last year. I came to the realization that I wasn't going to retire so I took 7 weeks off and hiked, kayaked, camped, met cool people, did drugs, went to music festivals,  visited friends that lived far away from me. It felt good. 

Part of my trip was hiking the W in Torres del Paine national park. It required booking tickets and hostels several months in advance. Being an avid /r/collapse reader, I really started to get nervous a SHTF moment would happen before I ever got to do anything fun. Once I got out, I was fine if civ collapsed or my life collapsed but I would have been pissed if something happened that triggered a fast collapse and I spent my whole life in school or a crappy job. 

Now I'm back to having a shitty job and I'm itching to run away again. So yeah do it. Do it now. Even if the techno optimists are right, that doesn't mean you're going to live forever. Do what you want to do. There's no rules for how to live your life. The default thing to do - get a job, have kids - is destroying the biosphere, you're free to not do that. It's probably better if you don't. 

This will sound dumb (as in cliche and not profound). I don't share it IRL but I'm on the internet so I don't care what people think - A mantra that I like to live by came from an EDM song ""do what you feel like, who fucking cares, heaven is so close, just be prepared""","2018-06-29 00:28:40","10","[deleted]","1747886764.582319","climate doom","manual"

compare the pleasure a lion gets from eating a gazelle to the pain experienced by the gazelle 

that same relationship can be seen in countless places, slight pleasure in exchange for excessive pain

you're the only one who can decide how you cope with that

personally I'm of the opinion that what I do, what I want to do, and what I have to do are all the same thing, so that way I can rationalize whatever I want, lol

> We feel powerless and doomed.

That are strong strong feelings. Most of all they are immobilizing and a self-fulfilling prophesy.

> I don't even want to fight anymore.

Having no aim means, you cannot hit the target!

> I feel that because collapse is so imminent and there's no future

If you cannot say good bye to your passing life, you drown with it.

> I feel selfish but there's nothing else I could do. 

You are, but you aren’t!

> The end is nigh. 

A dead-wish, never to realize …

> At least, I want to enjoy a little bit more before the explosion.

To feel happy is a well deserved need. Stress is unavoidably part of our life. Running away doesn’t solve that contradiction.

>  I rally want to die before collapse starts. 

To run away from disaster is a natural impulse.

> This world is a mess.

It always was. Only the illusion was it to be orderly and neat. Now you are confused, not the world.","2018-06-29 01:31:45","1","Hubertus_Hauger","1747886764.60559","climate doom","manual"
