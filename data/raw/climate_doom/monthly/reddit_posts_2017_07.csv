I wrote a graphic novel for the broad public, explaining the important concepts of Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics through the adventures of Maxwell's Demon. I’m here today to talk about it. AMA!","Political leaders and their constituencies debate climate change, global warming, and the effects of pollution. Yet most of the public are totally unfamiliar with the basic, classical physics concepts behind these phenomena. 

Thermodynamics is a heavy subject to learn and to teach - lots of multivariate functions, unclear definitions, and strange laws. So even science and engineering students are scared of heat, Entropy, and the second law.


Enter ""Max the Demon vs Entropy of Doom"", a super-hero graphic novel, based on the mythical Maxwell's Demon. 
I teamed up with my brother-in-law, the Brooklyn-based cartoonist Richard Codor, to create the book, which teaches Thermodynamics, Entropy, and the connection between Entropy and Information. The book teaches factual science in a fun way, in order to engage the broad public.
I’m here to answer any questions about the science concepts themselves. Richard will join me, to tell about the brainstorming and interactions during the creative process.

"6mlvi2","collapse","skeptical","I went to the NY and Paris climate conferences in an official capacity. I have seen what ""climate action"" looks like. We need more alarmism.","New York magazine’s climate change article has generated a lot of response, much of it largely critical of the supposedly “alarmist” tone, so I want to give my perspective as someone who has had a glimpse of what “climate action” currently looks like. And it’s a mea culpa of sorts.

I went to the New York and Paris climate change conferences (COP, in the insider jargon) in an official capacity working on policy, specifically financial policy as part of the response to climate change. I went to many other conferences, I participated in panel discussions, met with politicians, scientists, CEOs. 

I’d been in this role for a few years and the most depressing thing was this: as an organisation representing the financial sector we’d been too successful. So that by the time of the Paris agreement a significant portion of the efforts, from state and non-state actors, revolved around mobilising business to provide the necessary investment to tackle climate change. State actors were relegated to generators of “the necessary conditions” to stimulate investment. A line I helped push really hard, because I believed it. 

If you look at the text of the Paris agreement, the substance of it, it packages climate action within the pre-existing framework of neo-liberal economic policy e.g. how can trade, globalisation, consumerism, work towards the 2 degree goal? How can we ensure that pension funds, investment funds, banks continue to make lots of money and while doing so can be nudged to contribute to the solution. The question was never asked: are these non-state financial actors the problem? Even fossil fuel companies, unarguably the problem, were wholeheartedly invited to contribute to solving the problem. I went to a meeting with the UK’s secretary of state for climate change at the time (Ed Davey) where the Shell representatives were eagerly asked how they could help and future bi-lateral meetings agreed. BP, Total, Statoil and others were [feted for their joint initiative to tackle climate change] (http://www.total.com/en/media/news/press-releases/oil-and-gas-ceos-jointly-declare-action-climate-change). It was just words, PR. By focusing on how the financial sector (even the fossil sector) could help solve climate change, we had given politicians the ideal playing conditions. They could solve this by operating largely within their status quo comfort zone. No one had to lose, least of all business and investors. After all their efforts in creating a globalised market place (the neo-liberal feel-good narrative) and spreading wealth around the world, they could be the heroes again! It was a story all could agree on and feel good about. A solution that fit the pre-existing paradigm? Wow, why didn’t we think of it before.

It dawned on me (and yes, it had to dawn, I believed in the system, believed it was essentially working toward the good), that attempting to tackle the problem within the pre-existing economic structures was naivety and wishful thinking of the highest order. It necessarily involves a suspension of disbelief: what caused the problem can solve it. Climate change policy in 2017 is a complete failure of imagination. From my reading of the history, in the 70s, around Limits to Growth and the initial awareness of the problem, there was actually significant imagination with regards to methods to tackle it. Even Al Gore’s early efforts were not entirely in hock to business. That has died, subsumed by a globalised capitalist system run amok. A system we are all, unfortunately, locked into. The end of fossil fuel capitalism is the only way we have a chance of limiting warming to levels which could support a large, global civilisation. And that can’t be sold as policy. 

So the New York magazine article was not too alarmist. Because non-alarmism is failing, and this complacency is dooming us. The people in charge are running around fiddling with business as usual while the world burns and the ice melts. Last week the EU and Japan signed a new free trade deal to grow exports in many of the worst offending industries, especially agriculture and manufacturing.  But exports can’t grow without growth of transport emissions, so how can this ever be compatible with Paris? It can’t. But where was the strong voice arguing against it and for the climate? Neo-liberalism has taken control of climate policy, because it has taken control of governance. World leaders who all largely subscribe to the inevitable good of growth, of more, can’t be the ones to challenge it. Globalisation as practised by modern nation-states has only produced market-orientated agreements at the global level and not one agreement in the other areas of human interaction – work conditions, taxation, child labour, health. Or climate change. Paris is a market-orientated agreement, and if it’s the best we can do, the world is fucked, and more articles like the New York magazine piece need to tell us so.
