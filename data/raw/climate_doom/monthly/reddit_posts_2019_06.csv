"bz1lif","climatechange","action-oriented","The Power of Hope and it’s effect on human motivation.","Hi all!

This is my first post on here, I came here after reading an extremely frightening report on climate change. 

Amongst all the doom and gloom I feel I must observe that throughout history, there have been many scenarios that have seemed hopeless, this might even be the biggest. However we have frequently overcame seemingly insurmountable odds due to hope, ingenuity and the strength of the human spirit. With the universe out there, the solutions exist. 

A social tipping point is coming, progress has new reinforcements everyday while the powers that oppose progress fight a war on two fronts, with progress and the grave. 

If we can all raise awareness and be prepared to begin an industrial and economic green revolution within the next five years we have a chance, we still have the exponential growth of technology to contribute to our efforts. Our futures here CAN be saved, and I have every confidence that they WILL BE. If you don’t have faith in anything else, have faith in the Power of Hope. 

Just to illustrate my point, with exception of those with no means of accessing the knowledge that our climate is changing for the worse, all the most intelligent people in the world across 100s of fields and in nearly all places believe in climate change, so when it comes down to it something will be attempted and it will and should be on a massive scale. 

Good luck everyone!","2019-06-10 18:44:19","11","16","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bz1lif/the_power_of_hope_and_its_effect_on_human/","True","RennDennis","1747899445.2609549","climate doom","manual"
"c4skjl","climatechange","action-oriented","Journalist writing about climate anxiety","Hi all, 

I'm a journalist with Kaiser Health News and I'm writing a story about climate change anxiety (spurred in part by last night's Big Little Lies episode). I am looking for someone who would be willing to talk to me about their anxiety-inducing thoughts or feelings about climate change for the article - your real name would need to be used. I'm trying to make this somewhat of a self-help article where I ask therapists about what can be done to actually alleviate anxiety about this topic. I've seen a lot of posts on this subreddit about these types of anxious thoughts and I know a lot of us (me included) are feeling these types of overwhelming doom feelings about the climate right now and I hope this article will spread the word/help in some way. If you would be willing to talk to me about this, please respond to this post or message me. Thanks! -Victoria","2019-06-24 18:04:29","33","7","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/c4skjl/journalist_writing_about_climate_anxiety/","True","vrknight100","1747899450.1269078","climate doom","manual"
"bwh3zf","environment","emotional","What do you say to the growing number of people who say that due to climate change, humanity is doomed? They say we are past the point where we can save the planet. Are these people crackpot extremists or are they correct?","Lately I have read a lot of articles, some by scientists, some by activists, who say that humanity is doomed and that there's nothing we can do st stop what Climate Change is doing to the planet.

Admittedly, only a small number of the experts who are saying this are well known scientists.  Most say things will likely get pretty bad no matter what we do, but we can stave off the worst effects of climate change if we work at it.  That seems to be the consensus.

But what of the doomsayers?  Are they right? 

They do make a lot of sense.  They point out how what we are doing to reverse the problems of climate change, pollution, etc are really no where close to what is needed.

How do you respond to these people and these very fatalistic views of where we are headed?","2019-06-03 22:39:51","22","25","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bwh3zf/what_do_you_say_to_the_growing_number_of_people/","True","CW19997","1747899524.165503","climate doom","manual"
