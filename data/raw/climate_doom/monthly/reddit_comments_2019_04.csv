"ekig5j5","t3_bbduvm","bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","Great post.  I'd like to add a few more points on how I coped:

* Get less attached or even better, completely rid of your chemical dependencies.  Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, etc.  It's either you learn this now or learn this later cold turkey.  Like in the war simulator [This War of Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_War_of_Mine), survivors with dependencies on alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, at best suffer alone, at worst, find themselves easy victims to doing things they would rather not do to fuel their habits.

>This makes you anxious. Scared. Depressed. Suicidal even. If the end of the world is inevitable, why even bother, right? Stop. Take a second. Relax. Breathe.

* If you can't change the outer world, change the inner world.  Related to that earlier point, I found [meditation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL603BD0B03E12F5A1) of profound help in this.  And it's exactly like in the quoted text, just breathe.  From the simple act of observing our breath, there's immense depth in this practice and you'll find it much easier to deal with the reality we are living in.","2019-04-10 00:24:04","13","xorandor","1747898707.987736","climate doom","manual"

I'll just wander around, see how everything's changed and then see what's the best course of action. 

In the meantime just enjoy the luxuries you aren't going to get in the future.","2019-04-10 08:25:25","5","vezokpiraka","1747898707.9898849","climate doom","manual"
"ekja5uv","t3_bbduvm","bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","Good point. I think people need to find their own mission and you're right on the money. We still have 10 years!!!


Underrated message of the year.


I plan on opening up a bar this year (hopefully), use that money to expand into a soft dev business and hopefully take it from there. I wanna start a gin distillery, build an app, write more books etc!


This whole thing needs to be framed properly. Knowing it's all going to shit gives me more power to push myself to do things that I probably would not do. I make a ton of money compared to the avg where I live (EU) and I could probably ride it out in corporate forever. But now's the time to take more chances. 


You're right, not a lot I can do to stop it and I've been a vegetarian for 7 years now but because I am into animal rights more than anything. Still living the life I want on my own terms but going full throttle forward! Choo choo motherfuckers!

And if you're too caught up in your own head about collapse, do what I did. Imagine your life 10, 20 years from now and write that shit down. Whatever it is. I wrote a book imagining what it will be like. It does give you some mental comfort, at least it did for me. Now it doesn't seem like the boogeyman that has too many unpredictable and uncertainties around it, cause that's what's actually what's scary. Not knowing what will happen and how you'll react.","2019-04-10 09:14:12","4","sinkmyteethin","1747898707.993357","climate doom","manual"

Tell them the truth - the world is a racket ran by the biggest scammers who have ever existed and they are *intentionally* destroying the future. Teach children to go after the heads of these morons - metaphorically, of course.

I guarantee panic can be induced the fuckers responsible if enough children around the world start to wake up.","2019-04-10 10:51:27","4","AArgot","1747898707.9951591","climate doom","manual"
"ekjeeya","t3_bbduvm","bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","The one thing that resonates with me here is that one probably should start stockpiling food. I have a habit of spending as little as possible, which translates to eating everything I have before going back to the store. I kind of like that habit. But if I start seeing empty shelves at the grocery store, certain foods running out, I'll make sure to grab as much as possible before it runs out.","2019-04-10 11:04:42","4","Volcanic-Penguin","1747898707.997432","climate doom","manual"

"ekjqh3x","t3_bbduvm","bbduvm","collapse","skeptical",">*At the very least* start stockpiling food and water.

I don't know about stocking the water, you know most water is contained in plastics and given the fact that summers are incredibly hot there is now way that the water will stay clean, not toxicated with the polymers.

Even if you stock it in glass under earth with no sunlight in cold temperature, just count:

If you drink 3 litres per day it's 1000 litres (1 m^(3)) per year only for drinking. Water for growing or cooking is not included.

This is my most fearful thought, you just can't effectively stockpile water imho. There is problem with the space and purity of the water. Any contaminated water is still better than no water, you could somehow filtrate it, but... I don't know, it seems imposible for me imho.","2019-04-10 14:07:06","3","Bubis20","1747898708.003059","climate doom","manual"

Really though doing anything is the solution. Recycle your aluminum cans. Grow your own food. Maybe it does not save the world but it might inspire others to try, and once enough of us are at least making the attempt, it won't be that much harder to get the rest of us on board.
