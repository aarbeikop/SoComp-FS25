&#x200B;

1. The shutting down of debate is counterproductive; it does nothing to convince deniers & possibly swings abstainers to the denial side. Reasoned discussion is essential, even if it does become tiresome repeating the same points over & over.

&#x200B;

2. If a small human-made change to climate can be amplified to produce a large effect, then that implies that a small reverse adjustment could also easily fix it later.

&#x200B;

3. The lack of any clear explanation of how the massive climate changes of the last 100 million years fits with recent climate history. This suggests we're doomed anyway within the next 500-2000 years when the next ice-age kicks-in.

&#x200B;

4. If we are about enter a new ice-age within the next 500-2000 years, is it possible that human-made global warming could be used to stabilise global climate to prevent a new ice-age from happening at all?

&#x200B;

5. The more alarming the climate scientists warnings become, the more I hope they are mistaken, because I believe economic/political forces will prevent any effective action until it is too late.

&#x200B;

I'm genuinely interested to hear peoples responses to my points above.

&#x200B;

PS - I'm not a climate change denier, or even a skeptic, more of a climate agnostic... :)","2018-10-24 12:14:33","0","37","0.4","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9qz367/some_thoughts_about_the_climate_change/","True","ad1mt","1747889977.03538","climate doom","manual"
"9sehsf","climatechange","action-oriented","What are examples of how humans are ingeniously adapting to climate change?","A few weeks ago i read about how subsidence farmers in Bangladesh were taught to use ducks instead of chickens for pastoral farming practices, due to their various qualities in dealing with the constant flooding.

Amongst all the doom and gloom we hear through the media about the damaging effects of climate change, what other ways are humans seemingly interestingly & cleverly dealing with the problems that are arising?","2018-10-29 16:15:42","12","8","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9sehsf/what_are_examples_of_how_humans_are_ingeniously/","True","Qweiz","1747890020.8220139","climate doom","manual"
"9mk3y6","environment","emotional","To Those Who Want to Take Action","I’ve noticed that since the release of the IPCC’s report and the 2030 deadline to halt “catastrophic climate change” a lot of redditors on this page have asked how they can make an impact, how they can individually contribute.

Speaking to those inquiring that are Americans, it starts next month and in the coming months and years, by voting out politicians that don’t care about the planet, yours or your family’s future, or their own family’s future for that matter.  The politicians that only care about the green that can fit in their wallets and bank accounts.

While researching my own local politicians, up for re-election next month, I stumbled upon this website that grades politicians based on their track records in regards to voting for or against conservation and green policies/bills.  It’s a great tool that can and should be used by voters when they hit the polls.

We’re only doomed if you believe it.  Let’s vote these D-bags out and keep it to 1.5.
