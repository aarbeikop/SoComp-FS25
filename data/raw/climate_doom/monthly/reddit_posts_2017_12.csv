"7hnsnd","collapse","skeptical","Communists that have invaded this sub, why do you think you have the solution?","Class warfare and revolution bullshit in this subreddit is honestly annoying, this *used* to be a subreddit of collapsitarians, not anti-capitalists.

I'm done being mean and wanting you out, I welcome you, you took over, it's yours, post what you like, but I'm still frustrated at your message...

There is no revolution, there is no class warfare, there is only collapse, you are not gonna win here, this subreddit isn't about your fantasies of paypack against the the richest, it's not about ideoologies, **it's about physics**.

Communism provides no solution to this, in fact, to the contrary, communism would accelerate collapse and the total destruction of the biosphere on this planet, why? Under communism, the people get what they want... 

What is it that people want that goes beyond any political system? They want luxury, bigger houses, plentyful food, better gadgets, better infraestructure, better education, better opportunities, better public safety, better forms of transportation and so on that it is endless.

Under communism, there are no more rules, there's only the ultimate expression of the collective *want* everything they want, they will get, regardless of the price. Turning humans into termites.

There's nobody to stop how many kids people should have, there's nobody to stop how much carbon goes into the atmosphere, there's nobody to stop a million people collectively deciding they want to mine pristine rainforest.

Communism is all about a collective and evenly distributed *profit* system, profit for all the people, the spoils are now for everybody to enjoy.

A syndicate of doom, the collective irrational mind of humans who have been proven time and time again to be irrational in groups, groups have less empathy, less caress, less critical thinking, there is only what they want and the price they have to pay.

I swear I've seen some of you new communist users here claim there is no *scarcity* that is honestly just an insult against this community and can't believe such comments are even tolerated without a straight up BAN.

This community has been hijacked by people who don't even believe in the collapse we have been talking about for almost 10 years, they believe it's all about capitalism, so I'm here now to *denounce you* and to challenge every single one of you communists anti-collapsitarians to a debate, because if you are going to stay and keep posting your bullshit, you have to be educated in how the world works, be communist by yourself, but don't stain communities you don't even understand.

Utopic ideals don't belong here, this is a subreddit of the reality you deny, of the economics you spat upon, of the energy you believe is infinite and the rich are hiding from you and of the climate change you don't care about by empowering the people to do what they want to this earth via a collective agreement of *magical* attributes.
