So I can't know if SOMEONE already had said this before in a post/thread! Please be patient and read everything I will write down here, even if the amount of text is killing your brain. Also, my english is not perfect, but I try my best to explain what I want to say. :)

**Let us start from the beginning**

Climatic change is nothing new for us. We all have at some point heared of it. Maybe some of us here have already encountered the influence of the change in real life.

This post is not about ""why we have the change and what we need to do to stop it""... This post is my view of how things will turn out for us, IF we do NOTHING. You can think about it as a ""recall"".

So let me start.

Scientists  has told us many results of the climatic change:
- Rising sea Levels
- Melting Ice in the cold regions of earth
- Even more CO² from heating up grounds

and even more…

But what I want to talk about is HOW those results will affect our Society.

Now let me be clear, I'm not an expert. I'm just the common man, a citizen of germany, worried about my future and the one of coming generations.

Like all global influences, climatic change WILL affect our daily life in the future.

For example we take rising sea levels.

Because of the rising sea levels we will lose over the years alot of coastal regions. This will result in less space for humans to life which also will result in even more people living at the same place, increasing the workload of our habitat.

Not only will this let explode cities and villages in count of people, but also affect the financial economy of our life. Properties will get more expensive. Rental fee will get more expensive. Alot of other aspects too.

But that's not all so far.

A warming up atmosphere will result in droughts which will affect our agriculture. At that is a really critical point!

If we get problems with the agriculture, we will get over time problems with the food supplies for humanity and other life forms.

Like in the middle ages, food is a significant ressource. So important, that it can (and possibly will) cause wars between countries as same as power sources and Minerals will do.

Those finite ressources will get expensive and rare with the time and like I said, they are important for countries and their citizens.

Now, like you can imagine, I'm not talking about today or tomorrow. But I talk about the time in 60-100 years, maybe even beyond, if we do nothing.

We have to ask us, even the people not believing in climatic change, how can we justify to play god over our race, the comming Generations and this planet? If we wouldn't do anything, we doom ourselfs far more than we do realized overall.

This chain of events can be stopped. But the longer we wait, the harder and more extrem the solutions will be.

This post maybe didn't turned out that clear as I wanted it to be, but I did my best to present you my worries.","2019-09-27 23:16:20","1","8","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/da85y6/what_my_worries_are_about_the_future_of_humanity/","True","DerUnbekannteLP","1747901794.895324","climate doom","manual"

I have two other songs and I plan to release my first album soon.","Here are the lyrics 
A cattle farmer throws a match 

Inside the lungs of life 

Fiscal motives drive him

To put masses into strife 

Reversing  his species progression

Greed forces majority's digression

Exploits the divine obsession

Indoctrination sets in

A more desirable future reduced to real

Why can't the ruler feel


Arches of gold mark the locations of volition

Between sustainable or savorable energy rejuvenation 

Exhausted on powering machines while they traverse

In the destruction of their earth


A bolt of light sparks a flame

North siberias ignites into fire

The pines and permafrost melting away

Black carbon is released and travels with wind

To the ice caps of the artic accelerating doom

11 billions tons gone in a day melted away

The peat is uncovered and it To seeps into the air

50 megatons of emissions more 

Still rulers don't care

The smoke that rises up travels with the wind

Blows into the city's 

choking all their people

And all their life 

millions in strife

Yet still the dictator does not act

Denying all the claims

Calls it not economically viable

While spending trillions on killing machines

He cares more about the loss rubles 

Then the loss of a billion lives

So he lets the artic burn

He seals his species fate

Is the rebellion to late

Greed kills again

 It is human













 Obese privileged parasites waddle into sacred

Stores

Stomachs ribs and legs from desecrated lands line shelves and doors 

He reaches for the remains of a once beautiful soul

To stuff down his throat he derives pleasure so

Proofs his virility in acting selfishly

a choice he makes though the consequence effect others he will never meat




Planet burning rebellion churning

Apocalypse on its way

Wars for resources huntin and gather

Death is certain

Politicians stay the same

Burning mining  killing crying

Digressed to an early state

Oceans rising desert spreading

Could this be our fate

Silly human silly human silly human race

I have finally found the time to add some sources and citiations alongside my previous predictions [which can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c71yg0/a_brief_timeline_for_collapse) If any of the citations provided don't work or aren't correct, please feel free to yell at me profusely and I will fix them/replace them during my next revision. I should also starkly note, many of these articles that I included were released after my original post, and so also demonstrate the rapid changes that we are presently experiencing in the coming future.

I will keep this disclamer that I am not omniscient, and so I can't predict every natural distaster, international conflict, unforeseen catastrophes, or any other incredibly important catalysts that could accelerate the decline in our standards of living. I will try to briefly touch on these issues, but it is enough to just be aware that these things could happen at any time, unpredictably.

And with that once again out of the way, lets start shall we?

- Wildfires becomes an annual occurrence  in regions which are wooded, and are now prone to droughts. Over time, these forests will be destroyed by the fires, and for now, humans will step in to contain the worst outcomes of uncontrolled fires. ^[[13.1]](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2019/huge-wildfires-in-russias-siberian-province-continue/)[[13.2]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-wildfires-1.5228945)[[13.3]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49433767)[[13.4]](https://wildfiretoday.com/2019/06/01/canadian-wildfire-smoke-spreads-into-the-eastern-u-s/)
- The destruction of forests for pasture/farm land will also continue. Many of these forests also effect the environment that they're in (such as the Amazon Forest's cloud seeding), and this deforestation will have unforeseen consequences for the environments around them. ^[[14.1]](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/30/20835091/amazon-rainforest-fire-wildfire-bolsonaro)[[14.2]](https://e360.yale.edu/features/will-deforestation-and-warming-push-the-amazon-to-a-tipping-point)

Conflicts may arise, but they will not be the tragic life or death struggles that we will see in the future. ^[[15.1]](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/04/cape-town-water-conservation-south-africa-drought/587011/)[[15.2]](https://www.localnews8.com/news/national-world/zimbabwes-water-woes-worsen-as-capital-shuts-down-treatment-plant/1125550261)[[15.3]](https://globalnews.ca/news/5424366/chennai-india-drought-satellite/)
- The Ozone layer will continue to deplete if the current uses of CFCs doesn't stop. ^[[16]](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44738952)
- More species will die due to human activities and climate change, but humans will only be subconsciously aware of the lack of wildlife that are around them, and the underlying ecosystems will not unravel just yet. ^[[17]](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d6dzoi/the_ultimate_doom_post_just_kidding_its_worse)

- Unless something radical occurs, protests will continue to become increasingly common place. Regardless of the specific messages behind the protests, it'll all be fueled by a percieved disenfranchisment, wealth inequality, and a growing sense of resentment amongst nations (internal and external). ^[[24.1]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/topics/reference/arab-spring-cause/)[[24.2]](https://www.france24.com/en/20190928-french-police-yellow-vest-protest-macron-paris-toulouse)[[24.3]](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/the-triumph-of-occupy-wall-street/395408/)[24.4](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/asia/hong-kong-protest-violence-intl-hnk/index.html)[[24.5]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/climate-crisis-6-million-people-join-latest-wave-of-worldwide-protests)[[24.6]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/extinction-rebellion-plans-new-london-shutdowns-over-climate-crisis)

- In response to terrorism, western nations will lose more freedoms in the name of *safety*, but this loss of freedom will not yet be used maliciously. ^[[26.1]](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/the-inhumane-conditions-at-migrant-detention-camps.html)[[26.2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/us/sept-11-reckoning/civil.html)[[26.3]](https://www.accessnow.org/australias-plans-to-regulate-social-media-bound-to-boomerang/)
- Other nations, such as India, China, Russia, etc, will not tolerate extremism, and will swiftly deal with terrorism using the force of action (forshadowing how they will deal with the upcoming climate crisis). ^[[27.1]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/chechens-freedom-fighters-or-terrorists/6D45E5F7BD2D069418C5148823464054/core-reader)[[27.2]](https://www.uscc.gov/Research/china%E2%80%99s-response-terrorism)[[27.3]](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2186472/kashmir-attack-terror-group-jem-pushing-india-and-pakistan-brink)
- Global awareness for an ""impending catastrophe"" (without the knowledge of exactly what) will be mainstream. Denialism will of course still exist, but they will start to be seen as 'fringe' due to demographic changes (i.e. older people dying). ^[[28.1]](https://www.climatedepot.com/2019/09/24/poll-51-of-young-voters-believe-humanity-could-be-wiped-out-within-15-years/)[[28.2]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/492507/concerns-about-climate-change-united-states-by-age-group/)
- A growing polarization of politics, as tensions around the world increase from a mixture of all of the above points.

**~2030-2040: The Distant Future**

- Many of the things  that happened during the Near future will also occur in the Distant Future (increasingly erratic temperature fluctuations, the death of coral reefs, an increasing red tide, anoxic waters, an increasing amount of plastic pollution, floods and droughts, desertification, water shortages, terrorism, etc). The effects of these are very likely to be worse than before.

***Nature***

- The arctic ice, if it has not melted yet, would have almost certainly experienced at least one Blue Ocean Event by now. If it has not, at the very least the older ice within the Arctic would have almost all melted, with only the thinner, newer ice remaining. ^[[29.1]](https://www.livescience.com/23362-arctic-summer-ice-disappearance.html)[[29.2]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/12/11/arctic-is-even-worse-shape-than-you-realize/?outputType=amp)
- Due to the warming arctic, the Northwest Passage is now navigable for most, if not all, of the year. It now becomes cheaper to ship stuff from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Yay! ^[[30.1]](http://www.arctis-search.com/2020+Future+Scenario+for+the+Northwest+Passage)[[30.2]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/breakthrough/will-cold-dark-northwest-passage-see-more-ships/article16231502/)
- However, because of this loss of ice, Arctic ecosystems start to fail, and many species will be irreparably lost. Boo! ^[[31]](http://www.wwf.ca/conservation/arctic/threat/)
- The northern hemisphere experiences *even warmer* temperatures as the polar vortex becomes destabilized. Europeans/North Americans will recieve the worst of the warming (as seen by the record breaking temperatures recently). ^[[32]](https://www.noaa.gov/news/summer-2019-was-hottest-on-record-for-northern-hemisphere)
- Desertification continues in the already existing deserts (Sahara, Gobi, Atacama, the American deserts etc). New areas which, due to climate change, experience frequent droughts may also start the process of desertification. ^[[33.1]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-4493-3_1)[[33.2]](https://www.wearewater.org/en/the-sahel-desertification-beyond-drought_318262)
- Depending on how bad the arctic melts are, the polar vortex may form a di/tripole system, meaning arctic warming intensifies. ^[[34.1]](https://www.popsci.com/polar-vortex-fractured/)[[34.2]](https://globalnews.ca/news/4851800/polar-vortex-ontario-quebec-winter-storm/)
- Permafrost, if it melts in large enough quantities *may* engage a process called a [Clathrate gun.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis?wprov=sfla1) I'm not sure when this will occur, however, but the possibility is always there. ^[[35]](https://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/ocean-chemistry/climate-change-and-methane-hydrates/)
- Antarctica will continue to melt increasingly faster. I would assume that it will take a while to melt completely, but it will nevertheless consistantly raise the levels of the oceans as time goes on. ^[[36.1]](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/world/climate-change-antarctica-ice-melt-twin-studies/index.html)[[36.2]](https://phys.org/news/2019-07-instability-antarctic-ice-sea-rapidly.html)
- And with that, the sea level will indeed continue to rise, possibly flooding the lowest laying islands. Certain island nations may now cease to exist due to a lack of land above water. ^[[37.1]](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2146594-eight-low-lying-pacific-islands-swallowed-whole-by-rising-seas/)[[37.2]](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/16/one-day-disappear-tuvalu-sinking-islands-rising-seas-climate-change)[[37.3]](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sea-levels-rising-faster-indian-cities-at-high-flood-risk-ipcc)
- Depending on how bad the ice melt is, the North Atlantic Current may start to slow, or break down. The consequences for this is still yet unknown, but many theorize that Europe may cool down. ^[[38.1]](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/slow-motion-ocean-atlantics-circulation-is-weakest-in-1-600-years/)[[38.2]](https://e360.yale.edu/features/as_arctic_ocean_ice_disappears_global_climate_impacts_intensify_wadhams)
- *However, I disagree with the above point, since that scenario implies that the Arctic ice is actively cooling down the European continent. Once the arctic ice melts, I believe there will be no temperature gradient between the arctic and the equator during the summer (due to the tilt of the earth, the 24-hour arctic sunshine, and with no ice to reflect all that energy). This implies the desertification of southern Europe, tropical conditions in northern Europe (without healthy ecosytems due to a failure for plants to rapidly adapt), stronger hurrcanes which reaches further north than what is possible today, and unusually severe continental weather in Eastern Europe/Russia (i.e. record breaking highs during the summers, and moderately cool/warm temperatures throughout the winter). For North America it'll be similar, with the same severe continental weather that will similarly hit Canada and the US.* ^[[39]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorgen_Olesen2/publication/226146318_The_responses_of_agriculture_in_Europe_to_climate_change/links/0fcfd50a940df965e7000000/The-responses-of-agriculture-in-Europe-to-climate-change.pdf) 
- Crop failures. They will start to become commonplace, but for now at least, humans have the upper hand. GMO's, chemicals, and other technologies will save us from a complete famine (excluding the third world, which depending on each countries circumestances, may experience unrest/famine). ^[[40.1]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/india-s-latest-crisis-600-million-people-struggle-drought)[[40.2]](https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/a-new-accuweather-analysis-predicts-a-significant-dropoff-in-2019-crop-yields/70008414)[[40.3]](https://qz.com/1631469/midwest-floods-linked-to-climate-change-are-devastating-us-farms/)[[40.4]](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/persistent-heatwave-cuts-down-european-grain-production-giving-us-farmers-scope-for-increasing-grain-exports)[[40.5]](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/drought-brings-big-worries-farmers-across-northern-europe-n896096)[[40.6]](https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-wheat-idUSL4N23I11Q)[[40.7]](https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/publication/special-focus-asap-march-2019-severe-crop-damages-parts-southern-africa-hit-cyclone-idai_en)[[40.8]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/how-cutting-the-amazon-forest-could-affect-weather/)

- Ocean fish stocks plummet where over fishing occurs, and certain seafoods become expensive/scarce/extinct. ^[[45.1]](https://www.edf.org/media/new-un-report-species-extinction-highlights-need-fishing-reform)[[45.2]](https://www.edf.org/oceans/overfishing-most-serious-threat-our-oceans)[[45.3]](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/overfishing-species-extinction-african-food-crisis-threat-iucn-warning-niger-angola-mauritania-a7534901.html)
- The increasingly warming oceans will produce even stronger hurricanes, and in unusual places. A few record breaking hurricanes will have probably occured by the end of this period, but hypercanes and other super storms will not quite yet be a rare occurance. ^[[46]](https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt6j00b2h4/qt6j00b2h4.pdf)
- Nations (specifically island nations) which experience devastating hurricanes annually may have already collapsed. ^[[47.1]](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/americas/bahamas-hurricane-dorian-missing/index.html)[[47.2]](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/20/the-night-barbuda-died-how-hurricane-irma-created-a-caribbean-ghost-town)[[47.3]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/still-recovering-from-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-braces-for-tropical-storm-dorian)
- The Holocene extinction becomes even more noticeable as a good number of insects, birds, large predators, and other forms of life which can't adapt as fast as their changing environment, die. ^[[48]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/05/ipbes-un-biodiversity-report-warns-one-million-species-at-risk/)

***Society***

- At least one (probably two) worldwide depressions/recessions should have occurred by the end of 2040, and so the unforeseen consequences that goes along with it would have become widespread and noticable. ^[[49.1]](http://www.economicsdiscussion.net/business-cycles/5-phases-of-a-business-cycle-with-diagram/4121)[[49.2]](http://www.nber.org/conferences/2011/URCf11/Depression_2011_09_19.pdf)
- Many theorize that peak oil may have occurred by this time. This would mean an increase in oil price, the scarcity of oil, a breakdown of international supply chains, and conflicts within regions with abundant oil. *However, I believe this will occur in the Far Future.* ^[[50]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618303207)
- Conflicts over natural resources, if nothing has yet occurred, will probably be seen as inevitable in their near future. ^[[51.1]](https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/oil-war-and-the-future-prospects-for-peace)[[51.2]](https://energypost.eu/twenty-first-century-energy-wars-oil-gas-fuelling-global-conflicts/)
- Incoming climate refugees becomes an international crisis again, as socio-economic supply chains becomes strained under an increasingly hostile world. Nations which can't themselves become self-sustainable (or at least, not starve) will inevitably fail. Migration from these states that are not blessed with stability (such as we now see right now in Syria and Venuzuela, but globally) will spill over into neighboring regions. ^[[52.1]](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613342/get-ready-for-tens-of-millions-of-climate-refugees/)[[52.2]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.ipcc.ch/apps/njlite/srex/njlite_download.php%3Fid%3D5866&ved=2ahUKEwiB9rz_2vbkAhXIvZ4KHRntAyEQFjAMegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw0fkNew5DKuhr0oV_u8pHMT&cshid=1569783581805)
- Nations which are authoritarian will swiftly deal with refugees using carrots (assimilation) and sticks (genocide). ^[[53.1]](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2167893/china-legalises-use-re-education-camps-religious-extremists)[[53.2]](https://thewire.in/rights/kashmir-attacks-india-integrate)
- Other, more morally responsible nations, will continue to struggle with incoming climate refugees. This, combined with wealth inequality, and the increasing scarcity of resources, will inevitably spark conflicts amongst the lower classes. ^[[54.1]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-greece-lesbos-moria/fire-clashes-at-crowded-migrant-camp-on-greek-island-lesbos-idUSKBN1WE0NJ)[[54.2]](http://www.ekathimerini.com/244229/article/ekathimerini/news/unhcr-calls-for-eu-solidarity-after-lesvos-migrant-clashes)[[54.3]](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1011705/germany-angela-merkel-protests-migrant-policy-daniel-pegida)[[54.4]](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/12887/italy-france-clash-over-border-incident-migration-at-large)
- The freedoms in western nations which were taken away in the name of *safety* will continue, as well as newer restrictions (possible media censorship, a further decrease in internet privacy, water/food rationing, etc). This will be normalized under the generations which will be born, and raised, under these new 'normal' conditions. ^[[55.1]](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/10/atrocities-new-normal][[55.2]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbis-use-of-controversial-patriot-act-section-is-expanding-1432223491)
- At the very least the world will become a bi-polar world by now, between the United States and China. Depending on how well India can deal with the upcoming climate crisis, and depending on how integrated the European Union can become (and how they deal with refugees), and depending on how successful Brazil is, there is a strong likelyhood of a multi-polar world developing in the near future. ^[[56.1]](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/multipolar-world-emerging/)[[56.2]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-27/what-does-a-chinese-superpower-look-like-nothing-like-the-u-s)[[56.3]](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/11/16/can-big-idea-of-eu-integration-become-reality-pub-74780)[[56.4]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254352960_The_Rise_of_Brazil_as_a_Global_Development_Power)[[56.5]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282204070_Brazil_the_Carambole_Strategy_of_a_Rising_Power)
- Neo-colonialism will have become rampant. As unrest and famine occurs within the third world, and indeed increasingly so in the first world, many desperate peoples will have no choice but to work for foreigner companies in order to secure a steady pay, a full belly, and security for their families. ^[[57.1]](https://www.e-ir.info/2018/12/02/china-in-africa-a-form-of-neo-colonialism/)[[57.2]](https://www.ft.com/content/62b1e38c-bd83-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5)
- Depending on the severity of climate change up to this point, the resiliancy of each state, and individual circumstances, certain nation states may have already collapsed, with others filling the power vacuums left behind. ^[[58.1]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/12/inequality-rich-poor-essay-jared-diamond/)[[58.2]](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-countries-facing-water-crisis/)[[58.3]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/25/climate-apartheid-united-nations-expert-says-human-rights-may-not-survive-crisis)
- A ever more growing polarization of politics, as tensions around the world incresse even more from a mixture of all of the above points.

**~2040-2060+: The Far Future**

*I will preface this period by admitting that predictions mean very little here. It's almost certain that any sort of unforeseen consequence would have occured by now (I'm sure you guys can use your imagination). I'll just list the obvious things that I can think of.*

- Many of the things that have occurred in the Near to Distant future will probably continue to increasingly worsen in the Far future.

***Nature***

- The arctic ice will have been long gone by this point, and the arctic will have been ice free all year round (at the very least, semi-regularly) This will be catastrophic to the stable temperatures that we depend on to grow crops, and without the temperature gradient between the equator and the arctic to power the vortex, this will be the canary in the coal mine for some sort of collapse. ^[[59.1]](https://phys.org/news/2019-02-ice-free-arctic-summers-earlier-side.html)[[59.2]](https://www.euronews.com/2019/03/05/arctic-could-be-ice-free-in-the-summer-from-as-early-as-2030-study)[[59.3]](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2013/4/12/4217786/arctic-ice-free-summer-2050-noaa-study)
- The implications for an ice free arctic can't be overstated, since without any ice, the current climate maps that we use can just go out the window. No longer will Northern Europe, Canada, Russia, and Alaska be anywhere near as cold as it is right now, because, why would it? ^[[60.1]](http://geog.ucsb.edu/~qinghua/pdf/28.pdf)[[60.2]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240784572_Climate_Changes_in_Siberia)[[60.3]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/01/its-getting-warmer-wetter-wilder-the-arctic-town-heating-faster-than-anywhere)
- Permafrost collapse (and the clathrate gun hypothesis) becomes fully realized. ^[[61]](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/frozenground/methane.html)
""There is a huge amount of carbon stored in permafrost. Right now, the Earth's atmosphere contains about 850 gigatons of carbon. (A gigaton is one billion tons—about the weight of one hundred thousand school buses). We estimate that there are about 1,400 gigatons of carbon frozen in permafrost. So the carbon frozen in permafrost is greater than the amount of carbon that is already in the atmosphere today"".
- Desertification spreads northward due to droughts combined with record breaking temperatures that happen annually across the equator. Those who are living in the affected regions will not have a good time. ^[[62.1]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anagarciavaldivia/2019/07/30/desertification-a-serious-threat-to-southern-europe-lands/)[[62.2]](https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/BP_DESERTIFICATION/BP_DESERTIFICATION_EN.pdf)[[62.3]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928202508100177)[[62.4]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/04/china-great-green-wall-gobi-tengger-desertification/)[[62.5]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/08/vanishing-midwest-ogallala-aquifer-drought/)[[62.6]](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1389081/middle-east)
- As ocean temperatures rise, it is unlikely that fish will continue to thrive. There is a chance that certain species may be able to survive in a warming ocean, but overfishing/plastic/pollution will make their success short lived. ^[[63]](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/05/30/squid-are-winning-adaptation-race-in-warming-ocean/)
- Extreme weather events become ***even more*** extreme (wet bulb temperatures, fatal heatwaves reaching 55c+, deep freezes, etc), as these systems scour the earth with which human need to grow food on, and to live on ^[[64.1]](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603322)[[64.2]](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/12/22/humidity-may-prove-breaking-point-for-some-areas-as-temperatures-rise-says-study/)[[64.3]](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/super-heatwaves-55-c-emerge-if-global-warming-continues)[[64.4]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/01/30/this-is-why-global-warming-is-responsible-for-freezing-temperatures-across-the-usa/)[[64.5]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/15/climate-change-rainfall)
- Many places that are temperate nowadays will be radically changed. The individual weather systems are too complicated to predict, however, the effects are the same (changes which happen to fast for nature to adapt to). ^[[65.1]](http://sala.lab.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/123-439-453-Lauenroth-et-al.pdf)[[65.2]](https://e360.yale.edu/features/redrawing-the-map-how-the-worlds-climate-zones-are-shifting)
- Ecosystems collapse worldwide due to a variety of reasons like the death of insects from pesticides, the inability for creatures to adapt to hostile weather, a lack of food, habitat loss, ocean acidification, etc, etc. ^[[66.1]](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report)[[66.2]](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/report-million-extinctions-and-ecological-collapse-are-way)[[66.3]](http://www.wwf.eu/?uNewsID=346735)
- Crop Failures have become more common due to the increase of extreme weather fluctuations, and farming subsidies are no longer working due to the decrease in GDP growth (for nations which are not blessed with stability, and even so, for some nations which are 'stable') ^[[67]](https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/climate/map.php)
- Product shortages become commonplace in the global market place, as a mixture of climate change, crop shortages, and state conflicts over finite resources occurs.
- Famine becomes an international crisis. As the global poplulation increases, and as erratic weather patterns decrease the amount of usable arable land, there can only be one logical conclusion (and this time, GMO foods won't be the silver bullet). Unless human can grow the food they need, a global famine is inevitable. ^[[68.1]](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2888/when-drought-threatens-crops-nasas-role-in-famine-warnings/)[[68.2]](https://www.thenation.com/article/climate-change-media-humanitarian-crises/)


***Society***

*This world will be a much different place than the one we inhabit today, and without going into the specifics, I will try to talk about the general trends which may occur*.

- Peak oil will eventually occur once the known reserves run out. However due to new extraction methods, newly found sources, and the possibility for carbon capture, Peak Oil will probably occure late into the century (60/70s) ^[[69.1]](https://qz.com/117504/new-drilling-technologies-could-give-us-so-much-oil-the-climate-wont-stand-a-chance/)[[69.2]](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40580058)
- Neo-colonialism is now the only way to procure resources, since due to the nature of a multi-polar world (assuming Mutually Assured Destruction stays true, and if everyone hasn't blown themselves up), conflicts will inevitably arise in a finite environment. Likely this will be in the form of proxy wars by the Great Powers, and civil/conventional wars for minor powers. Conflicts will be over water, arable land, precious metals, oil, and other resources. ^[[70.1]](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3029735/china-and-us-new-cold-war-more-difficult-soviet-era-says)[[70.2]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/2019/08/how-climate-change-is-setting-the-stage-for-the-new-arctic-cold-war-feature/)
- By now, while noting the decline in global stability through the rejection of the western-backed United Nations by rivalling major powers such as China and friends, it is possible that a nuclear exchange could have occured by now (most likely from Pakistan/India over water). I am unsure what this will exactly entail for the international community, but nonetheless, hundreds of thousands (if not millions) would die. ^[[71.1]](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/09/1047992)[[71.2]](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/28/asia-pacific/u-n-pakistans-imran-khan-warns-potential-nuclear-war-kashmir/)[[71.3]](https://www.vox.com/2019/7/23/20707177/north-korea-submarine-nuclear-weapon-trump)[[71.4]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/eu-may-be-forced-to-withdraw-from-nuclear-deal-iran-told)[[71.5]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-nuclear/us-approved-secret-nuclear-power-work-for-saudi-arabia-idUSKCN1R82MG)
- Wealth inequality, if never addressed, is the worst it will ever be for those who are disenfranchised. If the current trends do not change, then indentured servitude is the only option for those who face starvation (due to the finite amount of food available). ^[[72.1]](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/income-inequality-continues-to-grow-in-the-united-states.html)[[72.2]](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jul/31/africa-wealth-report-2015-rich-get-richer-poverty-grows-and-inequality-deepens-new-world-wealth)[[72.3]](https://voxeu.org/article/forty-years-inequality-europe)
- The number of incoming climate refugees will regularly reach all time highs, as certain areas which were a home to millions of peoples become inhospitable. This would be from a mixture of reasons like sea water flooding coastal cities, regular floods and droughts, extreme temperatures, crop failures, diseases, etc. ^[[73.1]](https://theoutline.com/post/6778/the-world-has-no-protections-for-refugees-of-climate-disasters?zd=1&zi=yqzzmufb)[[73.2]](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/06/lets-talk-about-climate-migrants-not-climate-refugees/)
- The number of climate refugees on the borders of certain nations will become unsustainable. I am uncertain about the exact scenarios that may occur, but the effects are the same; people will flee regions which a great number are dying in, and the nations which can't handle the number of incoming refugees will choose between genocide and collapse (because, in a world of scarcity, will nations want extra mouths to feed?) ^[[74.1]](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/10/refugee-crisis-set-to-get-worse/)[[74.2]](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2018-002227_EN.html)


So there is my list of easily predictable things that could occur (with sources this time). I do plan on revising this piece until I am at least content with it, which has not happened yet. I may still add some more relevant bullet points, reduce the timeline intervals based on previous feedback, and fully complete the number of citations to make this post as accurate as possible. 

So in the mean time, enjoy! I hope you guys enjoy browsing it as much as I enjoyed making it.","2019-09-30 12:56:37","198","55","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dbb5n2/a_brief_timeline_for_collapse_w_full_citations/","True","Dreadknoght","1747902647.8796291","climate doom","manual"
