"f9qe9gm","t3_e6i471","e6i471","climatechange","action-oriented","> Even papers such as Clack, et al 2017 that roundly debunked the idea that solar, wind and hydro alone are sufficient to replace fossil fuels (in this case in response to a paper by Mark Jacobson) have done little good.

This paper of Clack is full of mistakes. Here's the [response](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/E5021) by Jacobson, and a much more general [meta-study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032118303307) about fully renewable systems (which includes both Jacobson's and its critiques). Also, some of Clack's arguments are specific to Jacobson's paper and are not a criticism of renewables in general (e.g the air travel situation).

This is not a criticism of nuclear energy. The only significant downside I found with nuclear plants is the planning and construction time, which is becoming increasingly problematic as the carbon budget dwindles. Construction times can be reduced by adding reactors to existing plants (when there is space) and by using smaller designs (assuming they're ready).

Overall, I very much agree with the comment of Dr Hayhoe.","2019-12-05 15:28:22","7","Helkafen1","1747905620.5372539","climate doom","manual"

>I would try to engage with positive, inclusive actions and solutions with those who are willing, and ignore those who are not.

How do we most effectively engage on this particular platform (reddit) when /r/climateskeptics is bizarrely a bigger sub than /r/climatechange and some of the most regular here commenters seem to be recalcitrants who upvote each other? They seem to enjoy wasting their time and yours, and other people are rarely going to read long comment chains so logically engaging with them seems pointless. Simply ignoring from the outset could seem like implicit agreement.

I'm not normally one to downvote but maybe on this sub in particular it is important to be active with upvoting and downvoting, and commenting agreement/engagement with thoughtful posts/comments.

Welcome thoughts on this.","2019-12-05 18:06:18","4","Levils","1747905620.5415199","climate doom","manual"

- air drying clothes vs in the machine
- purchasing clothes made from fabrics that do not give off microplastics in the wash
- hosting a clothing swap with your friends/family is a great way to promote circular and slow fashion! (Also look up Remake, a non profit that will give you the tools to do this and more!!)
- joining a local sustainability group like a zero waste club or one that focuses on the greener policies","2019-12-30 02:45:45","10","phomo8","1747906784.8601851","climate doom","manual"

On a more hands-on level, If you work in an office or large building, you can talk to management about how they can green the building, or conduct some guerilla energy efficiency tactics like turning off lights/thermostats in the evenings. But there's also higher level advocacy, like attending rallies, voting, as you said, or moving your career toward the environmental space. No matter what your skill set or background, you can choose your employer or occupation to benefit the environment.","2019-12-30 01:18:03","7","Tscook10","1747906784.867546","climate doom","manual"

For me this year it's less meat. My SO is not going to accept vegetarianism 🙄 so opting for less but locally sourced and or organic is i think my best bet.

Unfortunately, we need a whole lot more people living like you for it to make an impact, and current indications (a rise this year of emissions by 4%) suggest not enough are, and that we are failing in other areas too. 

Think of it in terms of scale and impact: Instead of litter picking on your own, can you find time and energy to organise an event where 10 other people attend? If you can, then you just increased the scale and impact of your actions. 

Convincing family members is a good example of this too. Good luck with that. It's a good place to start for many, and if each of us made advances here, the collective impact would be sizeable.","2019-12-30 11:17:55","2","NickBloodAU","1747906784.8804128","climate doom","manual"

This is a list I made on Amazon of reusable/sustainable products for the home like reusable q-tips, dryer balls, rechargeable batteries, silicone ziplocks, etc. It has a tool kit and sewing kit in there as I feel like it’s better to make an effort to repair something rather than throw it out and replace it. 

How I’ve essentially come up with ideas the past few years is every time I throw something away, I google whether there’s a washable/reusable version of it out there. I’ve also been trying to make/grow more of my own products at home to reduce packaging waste (buying a bulk bag of almonds that makes 4 months worth of almond milk is a lot less waste than buying fifteen cartons of almond milk). Washable air filters will be next on my list!

Cool showers have been shown to be good for your health even if they feel horrible. Good luck!","2019-12-30 08:02:08","1","[deleted]","1747906784.8825228","climate doom","manual"
