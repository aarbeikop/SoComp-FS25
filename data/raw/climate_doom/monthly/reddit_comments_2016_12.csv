"dbu8idt","t3_5laam9","5laam9","climate","scientific","Nothing is meaningless unless you surrender the right to give meaning to your life anf your work. Even as the Titanic was sinking, there were those who played music. Couples who died in the Upstairs Lounge fire were found lying prone together, holding one another.  People who were on that United Flight that crashed in Pennsylvania in 2001 didnt think they were going to make it either. Knowing they weren't going to escape, they chose to offer comfort to others and likely themselves as well. This sort of thing happens more often than you might think.

But here's the good news: it's most likely not that bad yet.  Human civilization *will* go through some rough days between now and 2100, but total civilizational collapse on a global scale is unlikely.  The problem with climate change is also its saving grace: it is a slow-progressing disaster. Cities will not generally become uninhabitable overnight, with places like New Orleans after their next direcrt hit being exceptions to the rule. We *will* have difficulty with crops and with numbers of refugees like the world has never seen before, but these are still not impossible problems. Russia was decimated by World War II and yet still exists.  So was much of Europe, for that matter.

Our quest for technologies to mitigate change proceeds unabated. We will have the technology to build a soletta (a giant solar shade) that alone could dampen climate change significantly within just a few decades. This is in no way a solution, but it would give us more time and the ability to alleviate *some* of the negative effects of climate change. (Ocean acidification being one that this stop-gap would *not* alleviate.)

You can take the attitude that this will not matter since you will eventually die, but that misses the point of living: all organisms eventually die. Our lives are not defined by how and when they end but by what we did before that end point, who we loved, how we ***lived***.

I get your existential dread. I really do. Mine paralyzes me as well some days. But mine is a symptom of my depression and anxiety. It's a symptom of the disease and my friends help me fight it when I ask them. You should figure out ways to get out and see the world and maybe even attempt to help others.

I'm a trained scientist and the data that I've seen points to abrupt, self-reenforcing climate change in the next years and decades.  If is gets really, really bad the air will be toxic and we'll need widespread deployment of life support systems.

The collapse isn't only the climate, but the monetary, energy, and shipping sectors of the economy are unlikely to survive what's coming without lethal interruptions in services.

However, hope is not lost!  The local changes you've started will be part of your survival strategy.  It's very unlikely we'll prevent 4 degC warming and multi meter sea rise; and it'll happen faster than people will adapt.  Without fossil fuels for industrial agriculture the carrying capacity of the planet may be much lower than there current population, or at the least massive migration and career changes will be necessary.

For me, I just kept looking for things that made me happy. I'm going to die, but I'm not willing to let myself not live while I'm here. So from outside the environmental side, just do what makes you happy, take your mind off the bigger picture.


I have also been worried about the existential crisis we face with climate change, so I went out and found something I could do about it that impacts other people. I worked for a year with a climate non profit fundraising to fund a carbon tax, this made me feel like I mattered towards the fight. I have since leaving that job begun working for a solar company doing sales. This has made me feel like I am really making a huge difference. Every time I close a sale, I know I am one person closer to combating carbon pollution. I don't even look at this as a job, but as my duty to the world, and to others, as a way to continue to cut pollution and look for a greener future. I am not a salesman, I am a climate combatant, selling people a sustainable future for us all. I believe if you find a place where you can achieve that feeling as I have, your worries will fade as you know you are guiding people into the future.","2016-12-31 19:39:12","4","Aclef","1747867244.099377","climate doom","manual"

I had some similar panics. What helped me was going into science. I don't study climate science, although the view from my field isn't any more positive. But learning to read science directly instead of getting it through editorial filters does help. Doesn't have to be climate science, pretty much any field will have applications to the crisis. My advice is to start with some MOOCs and see where it leads you. Twitter is also great for science. If you only follow scientists and their organizations you'll learn a lot fast.

"dbu8r6p","t3_5laam9","5laam9","climate","scientific","I read a great book by Dr. Dean Ornish recently (Love & Survival - 8 Pathways to Intimacy and Health), where he describes going through an existential crisis when he was 19 - too young and immature to handle it. He almost committed suicide, had to drop out of university despite being a very driven individual, and moved back in with his parents. 

He says he was far too young to handle the thought of the world going to hell and that, ultimately, nothing he does matters. That is, we all die, and so what's the point? 

What got him through it were a few things, but mainly the wisdom from some Eastern traditions, I think Buddhist in nature, especially *talking with* wiser, older people who had accepted life as it was. I encourage you to seek out such teachers, whatever their background. It's easy to reason ourselves into a 'life is meaningless' or other fear-based downward spiral, and if we don't have the means to handle it, suicide seems like the only way out. It is not.

Ornish went on to become extremely successful and happy. I have recently gone through a similar crisis with regard to climate change, but thanks to being 55, in a solid marriage, and having gained some life wisdom along the way, I found it overwhelming only for a time. I am now getting back into the climate fight and I managed to largely enjoy life even through the crisis.

It seems you are doing your part very well and are doing far more than most people alive today so you're good in that regard. Taking action and spreading awareness are our best weapons in this fight.

You are very worried about the collapse of civilization and are contemplating suicide over it. I was very suicidal and still have some exit plans in mind over a number of things, including the collapse of western civilization (and having no friends) and am a textbook definition pessimist who only focuses on the negative most of the time. But I realized something, there's no hope but what we make for ourselves and life gives us nothing but what we pry from its hands. It's our duty to future generations and to our ancestors to fight off the end of civilization as long as possible so we have to stick around now and fight for it. 

You're doing pretty much everything you can in terms of habits of practices but if you want to do more then convincing deniers is the number one way to do it. Posting here on reddit and talking about the issues is how I relieve my future anxiety whenever it gets worked up. To distract from anxiety you could apply yourself to showing people it's real and helping other believers do the same.
