Climate change alarmism looks and feels exactly like half a dozen former environmental scares, that all turned out to be wrong. So we can conclude, that many people have an emotional need to believe in such scares, and that such beliefs are exceptionally plausible to them. If we find a belief that many people strongly crave, the most likely explanation is that they believe it because they like the belief, not because it is true. That reality should oblige the emotional needs of the early 21st century green person is highly unlikely. It rather seems that global warming is a psychologism. A certain portion of the population simply wakes up with a sensation that doom is imminent, and then they come up with reasons for why this feeling is justified. The one common thread of the green era was that the world was always supposed to be ending, it was always urgent and hysterical, they just now and then changed the reason of why exactly it is ending. All these environmental scares are structurally replaceable, and seem to run the same emotional habit. The plausible explanation of these observations is not that greens must be right about the last reason they propose, but that they have some internal reason for believing in immanent doom, and then find rationalizations for it. Even traditional religion is functionally the same belief system and has been found to run on the same cognitive hardware as environmental beliefs. Warmists certainly behave like religionists, it is very important to them that everyone accepts their belief. Climate change has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations, always changing the story under the same label as old theories get refuted. The ""consensus"" thus does not confirm catastrophic global warming, but can refer to acceptance of any of the many theories with that name. Yet is always taken to confirm the current iteration of catastrophic global warming.

Edit: I'm throwing this out as a challenge. If you want to convert me, then explain it to me. I have heard plenty of the usual hostile talking points, and that's not what I'm looking for. Don't just request me to justify my claims, or nitpick at my arguments, and claim that me not making good enough arguments somehow makes your belief true. This is an opportunity to the believer, to explain to me, the disbeliever, why your belief is plausible.","2018-11-05 12:39:04","0","21","0.22","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9ud5pr/what_they_never_explained/","True","taylor-4","1747891006.458098","climate doom","manual"

"a0q5eo","climate","scientific","[opinion] Conservative Environmentalism ... (Constructive Criticism Welcome)"," 

The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has released a special report on the predicted impacts of anything more than 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in the atmosphere from pre-industrial averages. Earth could reach this bench mark as early as 2040 if current emission trends go untouched (Davenport, 2018). We would experience food shortages, wildfires, heatwaves, raised water levels, and extreme harm to fragile organisms and ecosystems like coral reefs (Davenport, 2018). How optimistic can we be in our ability as Americans to do our part? I would say extremely, but just like any political issue, but parties have good intentions, just different strategies. 

First things first, Republicans are not “Climate Change Deniers.” Only 9% of Republicans don’t believe in climate change (ClearPath, 2015). If we let single digits define an entire party, then the Democratic Party could be the Party of “The Moon Landing was a Hoax” (Griggs, 2009). But to many, Republicans might as well be deniers because they don’t think a top-down solution is the best way to save the Earth. The conservative take on environmentalism is deeply embodied in principles of entrepreneurialism, libertarianism, localism, and laissez-faire. As young Americans, the most climate conscience demographic in America (Funk, 2018), enter the world of political activism, it is important to promote free market values. Failing to learn the history of strong government regimes and socialism will doom us to repeat the past. 

What does a conservative mean by a hands-off government? They mean letting the invisible hand pick the winners and losers. Between Federal and State subsidies and tax breaks, the oil, coal, and gas industries receive over 20 billion dollars a year in corporate welfare (Redman, 2017). This is not only unnecessary, but deeply opposes free market principles. What about the government’s relationship with renewable energy production such as solar? They should keep their hands off this as well. The number of rules and regulations imposed on solar energy is very troubling in an age of progress. For anyone interested in installing residential solar panels, they must wade through a sea of red tape. (Pearce, 2016). The government should be making it as easy as possible for consumers to choose their energy sources. Solar panels can be very lucrative investments for an average household. But because of bureaucratic paperwork, the transaction costs of solar becomes higher than consuming fossil fuel energy from the grid. In addition to staying out of the consumers way when it comes to making environmentally conscience decisions, there is one more thing they can actively do. And that is invest in infrastructure. Presenting its citizens with an even playing field to compete is one of the most important roles of any government. The grid is basically a market place for energy, and limiting only utilities the ability to bring supply to those that demand it is crony-capitalism. The grid should be improved to allow even the smallest household, with even the smallest solar panel or windmill to feed energy to the market place. If a household had the ability to not only sustain themselves, but profit from a solar panel, a rational household where the principal investment would impose a low enough burden on income would do so. The increased supply would drive prices down. Unable to profit like they could at these new prices, fossil fuel generators would have to downsize operations, producing less dirty energy and, therefore, less emissions. This simple thought experiment doesn’t even take into account how an increased demand for residential solar panels would affect R&D investments into the technology of these panels themselves. 

As I said before, there are too many young people today possessing an unwarranted romanticism for socialism and a belief that a powerful central government is always the answer. I think it is important to explain to them why half the nation agrees with President Ronald Reagan when he said, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help’” (1986). The two main concerns are duel-sides of the same coin. The government shouldn’t do stuff for us, and it shouldn’t prevent us from doing stuff for ourselves. The former has a more behavioral element, the latter more of a moral quandary. The question often posed is, why shouldn’t the government control the power plants, they will be pollution conscience while not having stockholders for whom to grow profits? Well, the problem with this logic is that humans seldom thrive without incentives. Imagine a group of executives and their employees who are responsible for energy generation, however, because they are public sector, they have no skin in the game. No matter how cost efficient they are, they reap no benefits. No matter how cost inefficient they are, they can’t feel the pain because of the bottomless piggybank that a tax and spend system promotes.  Perhaps half the nation doesn’t trust the concept of a top down planner for the economy because many see politicians as nothing more than those road workers that take 10 weeks to fill a pot hole, and who needs slow ineffective road repairers with a god complex. Secondly, we can ask a more basic question. Why do humans deserve freedom? Of course, we can all agree that any form of nonconsensual control over a human by another goes against everything that we know to be just and true. But we undeniably have social contracts. How is holding someone behind bars different than preventing someone from buying a big gas-guzzler that the government has deemed unacceptable?  The criminal is a threat to society, but only when it is proven beyond doubt. Conservatives don’t think that someone should be anointed as the decider of what is allowed and dictate a standard to which all must abide. That brings into question ulterior motives and conflicts of interest. Everyone wants to save the world, and conservatives genuinely believe we don’t need to sacrifice our freewill to do so.

I think the best way to conclude is with some common ground. In June 2017, President Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord. Obviously, this decision was not bipartisan, but the next steps taken by climate change activists was. Americans Pledge is a collection of states, cities, businesses, universities, and citizens working to participate in the Paris Accord without the Federal Government (Americans Pledge, 2018). While some see this as plan B, conservatives see this as plan A. The localization of power increases the accuracy of government action to the desires of constituents. Contacting local government should be the new normal when it comes to activism.

Lastly, as Young Americans move forward with their lives, I urge them to do a few simple things. Realize that those that disagree with you are not inherently unintelligent, immoral, or both. And to disapprove of your proposed solution is not a denial of the existence of the problem.

"9yz1w9","collapse","skeptical","Climate doom in 10 years!","I've been on Reddit more than 10 years, and I've survived Ebola in Texas, SARS, MERS, and several r/Conspiracy doom events.

I see the history of climate change - the trends of 1930's looking like the temp was dropping for ever in an ice age phase. Sulphur particles due to world war post production - but they didn't know that then... (some say there was a large ""warming"" consensus even back then, but thanks to online archives a tally was made in the last month and cooling was certainly a consensus at one point in time).          

Remember Acid Rain killing all the trees in Europe, and eroding all the sandstone buildings? I survived that. So did the trees.             
https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717290-400-europes-forests-fall-to-acid-rain/           

Remember the ozone hole? I survived that. (Some news sources suggest the holes not going anywhere for decades, even though we saw a ""We solved it"" posts just a month or two ago! Interesting stories if you go looking for it)                
https://theconversation.com/the-ozone-hole-is-both-an-environmental-success-story-and-an-enduring-global-threat-100524              

The other side to the story: **Evidence for a continuous decline in lower stratospheric ozone offsetting ozone layer recovery**          
https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/18/1379/2018/              

We've not had the mother of all pandemics since the Spanish Flu of 1918. Healthy middle aged people where malnourished due to war - chances are we won't see one until well into collapse when the worlds (even first world - where people travel by plane) people are again malnourished.       
The Red Death, and the Black Death came and went...

Then the global warming ideas - where EVERYWHERE would be heating up. Remember the 2005 headlines ""NO MORE SNOW AT CHRISTMAS!""?                   
That was the story - that kids would not see snow after 2010 anywhere due to global warming.                  
**https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/snowfalls-are-now-just-a-thing-of-the-past-the-independent.pdf** << They even DELETED it from their archives to ""whitewash"" climate change!                              
**2001:  Meltdown. Snowfall may be good in Europe this weekend, but global warming could put an end to skiing altogether - and soon**               
https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2001/jan/14/wintersportsholidays.wintersports.ecotourism                    
**http://pistehors.com/backcountry/wiki/Weather/The-Effects-Of-Global-Warming-On-Skiing**           

Then it was changed to ""Climate change"" - because **scientists didn't understand the climate**, or at least the news reporters that jumped to the ""no snow at Christmas"" conclusions - the snow didn't go away in the winter, and climate deniers pointed and strawmanned ""Look! It's all rubbish!""         
The scientist discovered extremes happened instead - extreme heat, extreme cold. It was changed to ""Climate Change."" to reflect the new understanding.                      

Along the way - **every time** - people were sure about the future - but it seldom works out the way they think.                  
The ski resorts are still open, the winters still happen, flu goes around, the crops still grow.                
For example, the l'Alpe d'Huez is still a ski resort, 17 years on, and doing well:   https://www.alpedhueznet.com/


So I may be a little cynical about the ""Doom in 15 years"" angle - but only due to what I've lived through, and the history I've read.

I'm not denying squat - but want to say it's more complex, and there's more *unexpected* things happen than you'd think!
