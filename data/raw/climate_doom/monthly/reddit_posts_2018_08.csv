"96g04o","collapse","skeptical","Too much inaccurate information in this subreddit[META]","We have had multiple cases now of vulnerable people who visit this subreddit and end up becoming suicidal because of all of the doom and gloom they read.

I'll be the first to acknowledge we're stuck in a very difficult position as a species and we should be free to discuss this topic with each other. The problem I see however, is that incorrect information rises to the top and attempts to point out the inaccuracy tend to be ignored.

Again, this is dangerous. We all know suicidal and severely depressed people visit this subreddit. If they see information that alleges all sorts of imminent catastrophes and other hysteria, that can be enough to drive them over the edge.

Let me give some examples of incorrect information that shows up here. Example: [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/95zy7n/10c_of_temperature_rise_is_already_locked_in_due/)'s a claim that 10 degree Celsius of warming is already locked in. This is just not true. I explain why it's incorrect, [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/95zy7n/10c_of_temperature_rise_is_already_locked_in_due/e401yro/), but nobody will ever notice.

[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/96dhr2/area_burned_in_wildfires_in_california_19602017_oc/e402xa9/)'s a graph somebody made, on our frontpage. You have to scroll down into the comment section, to see the OP confirm that the graph is inaccurate. Solution should be simple: Delete the old post, then make a new post with the correct graph.

Last, but perhaps most important: Guy McPherson keeps showing up on this subreddit. The guy is a lunatic. If humans were about to go extinct due to climate change within a few years, you would have heard about it from somebody other than Guy McPherson. Serious climatologists have looked at his arguments and [debunked](https://fractalplanet.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/how-guy-mcpherson-gets-it-wrong/) them. The consensus is that the IPCC downplays the severity of the situation we face to appease policymakers, but nobody suggests we'll go extinct soon.

Again: This isn't just misinformation, it's dangerous misinformation, threatening to people who suffer from poor mental health.

The solution I would suggest is to be critical of everything you read here. In addition, I would encourage you to be critical when it comes to the content. If it's wrong, downvote it. Doesn't matter if you like or dislike the guy who posts it. The frontpage should contain accurate information, not hysteria and misinformation. In addition, if you figure out there's an error in something you submitted, just delete it. Misinformation spreads very rapidly, you don't want to accidentally spread wrong information, as you won't have a chance to address it once it's out there.","2018-08-11 11:51:51","390","152","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/96g04o/too_much_inaccurate_information_in_this/","True","Yellow_Tiger1","1747888520.329918","climate doom","manual"
