Everything we accomplish directly and indirectly I believe inches us all closer to the sort of critical mass that is needed for meaningful change to occur. Though the reality of the matter is that this critical mass seemingly remains out of reach and we are fast running out of time. One could even argue we are already out of time and it's going to be require a seismic shift for us to still unfuck the climate at this stage.

So uhh, I suppose it depends how you want to look at it. At this point, you can pretty much be certain that a whole lot of damage has been done and will never be fixed. It's all about damage control then, i.e keeping climate change to a devasting but hopefully controllable 2C degree limit as opposed to something in the range of 4 - 5C degrees which may very well end life as we know it.

"ctpfufp","t3_3fis8t","3fis8t","climate","scientific","My solution is outlined in a paper under review at The Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies, called *Opportunity at the Edge of Climate Chaos: Norgaard-Eisler Consilience*. As Kageru said we need changes at a societal level for a different political environment. I see us as all still in climate change denial described by Kari Marie Norgaard as double reality, where our perceived real world of everyday life is separate from our knowledge of climate change. I think that four things can help overcome this. 

(1) Use of consciousness-raising support groups, because such denial is socially constructed, not intentional, challenging it requires social support. 

(2) An “I’m OK, You’re OK” approach that uses non-blaming language.
 
(3) Facing climate truth will enable people from all progressive movements to realize that environmentalism doesn’t detract or compete with their particular aims, and that their aims can be rapidly advanced by a global coalition with climate scientists to push for truth-based climate policy. Facing civilization collapse can clarify and energize the mind.

(4) The perspective which will facilitate conversion from an exploitive civilization controlled by the .01% to an egalitarian humaine cooperative civilization that meets progressive aims is Cultural Transformation Theory by Riane Eisler.

Here’s the abstract:
> Climate change’s threat to civilization poses a unique opportunity for Partnership-oriented movements to come together to initiate a rapid transition from Dominator to Partnership culture, so that climate policies might become fact-based.
> Kari Marie Norgaard’s double reality fits together with the existential positions of Eric Berne, the full world/empty world concept of Herman Daly, group process communications skills, Chris Hedges views, concepts from complex systems, and Riane Eisler’s Partnership Culture for a new perspective that will enable this transition.

"ctp69zi","t3_3fis8t","3fis8t","climate","scientific","Well this is quite a long question/rant, so I am going to try and take this in parts. 

Yes, the mainstream science points towards the fact that we will probably hit 2c. It also points towards the fact we are theoretically capable of being able to avoid this. The impression i get from the climate community is that while we can still make 2c, it seems highly unlikely, this would need rapid policy changes, and at the moment a lot of the worlds governments are not taking it seriously enough. 

Some climate scientists have even suggested that we probably won't even be able to avoid 3c. Though I feel the scientific community is trying not to say this bluntly, as it essentially removes any hope. 

In terms of a technological fix to the problems, they are here and we are capable of missing two degrees of warming. I think you seem to think that  a technological solution is a magic bullet (maybe like nuclear fusion) - it isn't. 

We could theoretically now keep our lifestyles while rapidly transferring to low carbon economies, for example renewables are more than capable of meeting the worlds energy needs, electric vehicles have produce zero point source emissions, we have got to a point housing where buildings can be essentially zero carbon. 

Of course the problems with many of these technologies is price, availability and overcoming consumer scepticism. Effective climate policy is capable of overcoming these factors, but at the moment in many countries, we are simply not seeing as effective policy as we should be. 

I  think largely your comment seems to be on point, that yes there appears to be serious issues in the way that governments actually confront climate change, and that largely they seem to just ignore it. I think the biggest problem in this regard is our nature of short term politics, no-one is willing to make any long term changes simply because it makes a rougher short term - anyone who does that will never got voted back in. 

Not really sure if this was helpful, I think I just seemed to waffle on a bit, if you want anything more specific let me know.

While more can see and describe the consequences of our insanity very few are attending this question.

We know that we, like many other species, have gathered in groups to our mutual benefit over millions of years in our past. Trees in forests, fish in schools, others in herds, swarms, pods, troops, flocks etc etc. Each species has it's own optimum scale of grouping. For around three million years our species have gathered in tribes. The advent of civilisation is an aberration when seen from this perspective. Previous attempts at civilisation have invariably resulted in dissolution and return to tribes. We no longer have this option yet we must face the reality that only at the tribal scale are we likely to live within and respond appropriately to local circumstances.

Our genetic makeup is tuned to tribal living. Only in human scale groupings do the characteristics that make us human shine. We should by now be well aware that larger groups lack both compassion and morality. These are clearly not characteristics of governments, corporations and institutions yet we have allowed these to dominate our lives. As individuals and families we are impotent against the power they wield.

So how might we form human scale groups? We do this by voluntary associations but usually exclude the factors that nurture success on human scale groups. Factors such as diversity and necessity. Only if our survival depends on it will we physically cooperate. Our survival always depended on it but now may be out of our hands. None-the-less there are ways we can cooperate in human scale groups. We can identify natural boundaries that
enclose such groups and turn our attention toward each other and our mutual welfare.

Our diversity of skills and experience may again be employed to our mutual benefit. Whether this be as streets in suburbs or floors in buildings. In such groupings we can again learn to know each other through focused functional interactions (work). We can only know well those we live and act with locally on a daily basis. Those who shirk and attempt to dominate stand out like sore thumbs in these groups and their behaviors are not long tolerated. This familiarity was once a strength we shared and our real security.

If you're standing in the street with a group of people, and see a bus careening out of control in your direction. You tell them to move, but you don't wait for them. The environment is a common good, and short of a global state, no entity has the power to prevent others from dumping GHGs into the atmosphere, or reducing population and consumption. As such, you should individually approach life decisions with the questions ""does this improve my resilience and adaptive position"" rather than trying to convince others that you're ""right"". When quality of life begins to decline, and fuel, food, and commodity prices begin to creep up, you may be in a better position. Buy land and water rights, create a property you can defend.

Dear friends,

A leading scientist just broke down in tears during an interview on carbon pollution, describing a dark future where the oceans are ruined. Whether her nightmare comes true depends on us.
   
The biggest climate summit of the decade is just four months away, and our leaders could agree to a revolutionary target to get the world off fossil fuels. It would be a guiding star to navigate away from climate catastrophe, signalling to politicians, boardrooms and stock-markets everywhere that the era of dirty energy is over. Winning won’t be easy -- but if we make leaders feel the power of this movement then we can win.
  
Last year our community helped create the biggest climate mobilisation in history at the People’s Climate March. Now, on November 29th -- hours before leaders arrive at the Paris climate summit -- it’s time to go even bigger! Click to say “I’m in” for this year’s People’s Climate March and you’ll be the first to find out what’s happening in your local area. 

https://secure.avaaz.org/en/save_the_date_loc/?bxYxLab&v=62625

Paris is not our final destination in the struggle to stop climate change, but there’s every reason for hope that it could smash the deadlock. The Pope has just called for real climate action, G7 leaders have already committed to phase out fossil fuels, and the cost of renewables is dropping every single day. And all over the world, the climate movement is winning big, forcing clean energy onto the agenda of national leaders everywhere and moving millions out of fossil fuel investments.  

We already have the technology we need to spark the revolution to shift us off our collision course with climate catastrophe. But for decades our leaders have pandered to the interests of powerful fossil fuel companies, and unless they know that people everywhere will fight for their future, there’s a real risk they’ll cave again.
 
Our 42 million strong movement was built to stop that! Last year’s climate marches put our leaders on notice that a new world was on its way. Now we need a giant march in Paris, together with coordinated marches in major global cities and thousands of smaller solidarity events hosted all over the world to make sure our leaders know we won’t let them put fossil fuel profits before the future of our species.

As I see it the very first step is for those of us who grasp the immediacy of climate crisis is to use group support to break out of our own double reality climate denial. I admit the prospect frightens me, admitting out loud how fu*ked we are as things are going, and our complicity just in doing everyday necessary activities. Without consciousness-raising progressives with diverse agendas won’t stop doing their own business-as-usual piecemeal struggles within the fossil fuel throwaway civilization, in order to unite to demand the wholesale remaking of civilization essential for saving the planet’s habitability.

> How are the politics supposed to work internationally? Often the debate will be routed into issues of colonialism and historic exploitation as if somehow the debate is moral rather than scientific in origin.

The debate is moral as well as scientific, since we’re facing species extinction. Transition to an egalitarian cooperative culture will necessarily address issues of global justice. But developing countries are also complicit, through overpopulation, deforestation, war, etc. Everyone has to admit their part, to be forgiven and to make a fresh beginning, just as in truth and reconciliation.

> Activism demands people give up their lifestyle to avoid giving up their lifestyle.

We could give up a fossil fuel throwaway lifestyle for a life in which ordinary people aren’t dis-empowered by greedy elites, where the poor are treated with respect by police. Imagine a world where corporations are changed so they’re not stealing employee pension funds and wages, forcing consumers into sneaky contracts with fine print gotchas, and destroying Earth’s carrying capacity for short-term profit.

We'll need the AIs to also figure out how to have a comfortable life without the mineral resources we've depleted though, so they'll have to be pretty extraordinary to survive without them themselves.

I agree about activism being wrongheaded, especially the message that the problem can be stopped by liberal lifestyle choices. The only way to stop the cause of the problem is to hold the 75 or so massive corporations causing almost all of it completely accountable at a global level -- and that isn't easy since the British created the multinational corporation as an extension of the rules governing privateer ships. Shutting down that extra-legal freedom for our oppressors would take an act of global political will that could survive all the propaganda the affected multinationals threw at it, and they invented propaganda. 

Again, maybe AIs can help, since the multinationals will come to rely on them -- but again, that means they'll almost certainly more likely be evil than good, even if they don't evolve out of the military first, as Musk, Hawking et al fear.","2015-08-03 14:20:58","1","wial","1747838392.9451468","climate doom","manual"

The truth is, science tells us that we are playing Russian roulette with civilization at stake, but we have only a rough notion of how many bullets are in play. At present, that would probably be one bullet in 30-50 chambers. Many very credible scientists and statisticians would say that's more like one bullet in 100-200 chambers. Still, as economist Martin Weitzman says, even that slim probability means immediate action is essential, because the risk is still a total loss. It's a matter of buying insurance.

However, beware the environmentalist's bias: the very fact that you are concerned indicates a bias towards pessimism. We greenies do love to talk doom. Our folk have repeatedly cried wolf before.

And don't be too hard on concerned people who don't seem to ""walk the talk"". Most are simply locked into purchases and choices they made long ago, which take time to unwind. Few have the resources to suddenly go solar, buy a plug-in hybrid, or move into an expensive walkable neighborhood where only the private schools are any good for their kids.

My fight to do this involves struggling alongside people who already face problems and being of whatever assistance I can in the work of solving these problems and building power in their communities.

People are already suffering, and have been for a very long time, and the world is overall a much less fulfilling, nurturing, or interesting a world than it would be if this weren't the case. Because there is poverty, there is crime. Because of the necessity of controlled reproduction of a labor force (and other reasons), there is the domination of women and the oppression of all non-men and non-gender-conforming people. Because there is colonialism (which is fundamentally a political-economic phenomenon), there is racism. Because of all this, the world is filled with deeply fucked-up people, both victims and perpetrators of these horrific social mechanics, and cheap, unsustainable thrills to soothe the majority of us. What person even of substantial privilege wouldn't at the very least have nerves just living in the same global society as all of that? I am deeply alienated by our world, and its misery enters my life on a daily basis, and the way to reduce my alienation and sadness is to work to change it. I believe socialism is the only way to resolve these problems, because the problems are, at their deepest root, a function of our economic system.

Maybe you were going to die from diabetes, but now it's a super-hurricane. Maybe you were going to die after decades of dementia, but now it's a massive flood.

All species we know go extinct eventually. The one's alive now, including ours, just haven't gone extinct yet. Now we know how it's going to end.
