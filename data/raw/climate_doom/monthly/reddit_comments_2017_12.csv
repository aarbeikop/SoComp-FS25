Such has been the case since the dawn of agriculture, a divide between rich and poor, rulers and peasants, oppressors and oppressed. To deny this is to deny history.

I'm no communist, but it's abundantly clear that capitalism has made massive contributions and exasperated collapse quite substantially. It's blatantly obvious that our system is not working, or rather, it is working exactly as designed, which means it doesn't work for 90% of people. So, naturally, people search for an alternative, communism being most sensible.

However, I do agree with you that this argument is useless, communism cannot create oil, land, coal, species or end co2 emissions. Perhaps it would do a better job of suppressing our growth, but growth is a symptom of our own cursed biology, we cannot control our urges to procreate and occupy every possible piece of habitat.

Communism, Capitalism, Socialism, we still collapse. That being said, Capitalism is fucking over the vast majority of the population on earth, including myself and yourself, unless you're among the 1%. You are completely correct besides the fact that you claim there is no revolution and no class warfare, these patterns have been consistently repeated for thousands of years.","2017-12-05 06:23:07","66","Kurr123","1747880803.329323","climate doom","manual"

I can tell you there is no love lost with commies in my family since they killed a bunch of them (none I ever met) but the fact remains that on this English speaking sub everyone here is going down under neo liberal capitalist rule, so capitalism bashing goes with the territory. 

It probably has to do with anger at the lie they were indoctrinated with for their entire lives and is still being preached by all the mouth pieces/legitimizers of the ruling class. It's unraveling and they are lying. Pretending everything is awesome. 


I get the blaming capitalism part as the SOLE cause of collapse is irritating and you would be hard pressed to find anyone on here who has continually said it's the humans, the humans, the humans more than I have. They are a fucking cancer. Consume--Infect--Reproduce

The fact remains that capitalism is, for an ever growing number of westerners, the boot that is stepping on their neck. It is a failed system, yet is still being touted as a solution so those of privilege can remain there until collapse.

I don't believe you. I think you have an agenda and are trying to cover it with your fake concern for the sub.

You are rationalizing. It's what humans do. I don't believe you have shaken any of your indoctrination & faith. The whole rabid anti communism thing was a dead give away.

BTW, how much of your life experience and hate for communism comes from living under commie rule vs how much is daddy talking and your indoctrination? 

Capitalism is a failed piece of shit human invention? Not natural and not real. A designed social system conjured up by a troop of rapacious apes whose only purpose is to degrade as much energy as possible. 

When the humans are extinct later this century so will be capitalism and Christianity and all the gods, social systems and other human created fictions.

>it's not about ideoologies, it's about physics.

This is a great example of the overlap between marxist and doomer thinking. Marx's notion of dialectical materialism--that history moves by the contradictions and conflicts of opposing material forces and phenomena-- seems to me to be perfectly consistent with the collapsenik view that our social, economic, and political systems are incompatible with, indeed in utter conflict with the natural world on which a functioning global society depends. Capitalism, as Marx points out, is digging its own grave. Marx's thought is littered with ecological insights. For instance, take this excerpt from *Capital*: ""All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the laborer, but of robbing the soil.""

I can't tell you how many times I've seen that same point made on this sub long before the supposed communist invasion that the OP is fretting over.

Conditions in Rojava are hard and things are messy but people are doing ok. Meanwhile Aleppo was a literal hell on earth. 

And yes you can split hairs and say that [communitarianism isn't communism but the distinction is largely to distinguish it from the failed attempts at top down state communism that came before it and an explicit focus on the environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ecology).

"dqtmqto","t3_7hnsnd","7hnsnd","collapse","skeptical","Infinite growth on a finite planet is impossible.

Capitalism has infinite growth baked into its internal logic. The central logic of capitalism is about investing capital with the goal of getting the initial investment back plus more. Without the more, there is no incentive to invest. Without capital investment in capitalism there is no reason for a stock market, no reason for banks, no one would start businesses, no one would hire workers, etc.

Initial investment plus more requires growth. For those of you that still aren't convinced, think about recessions and depressions. A recession is two quarters of declining growth (still growth) and they are quite painful for the majority of people while depressions are worse. With this in mind try to imaging a future with negative growth until we reach sustainability then virtually no growth afterward.

The laws of thermodynamics tell us growth requires energy. Most people on this board understand we are looking at declining energy production in the near future.

So, it should be obvious to anyone that can think in terms of systems that capitalism can't survive what's coming.

All that capitalism has left for us is a system where those in power try to maintain their living conditions while pushing collapse onto everyone else. We are experiencing this now and most of us don't like it.

It makes sense to try to figure out how to make collapse more bearable for the rest of us.

In my mind, it isn't just capitalism, any top down system will result in those in power trying to maintain their own living conditions at the expense of the rest of us.

Now we are talking about bottom up systems if we want any sort of decent life in the future. This means social power must be shared equally. This will also provide the added benefit of each individual finding a way of life that makes them happy and healthy while not consuming as much as we do now. I for one would be happy to trade consumption for more free time. Capitalism can't allow people to make that choice because of the growth requirement and the fact that humans are one of the natural resources capitalism relies upon to exploit.

You're actually talking about emergent co-operator/defector strategies in an evolutionary generalization of the iterated prisonner's dilemma. A population of out of control agents of human intelligence in this particular planetary context results in a typical bacterial cell culture kinetics: exponential growth, overshoot, die-off. 

https://www.mpi-bremen.de/Binaries/Binary307/Wachstumsversuch.pdf

See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons

So bottom-up strategies don't work, the question is which kind of coercive, as in behavior constraining strategies would work. This was the basic regime differences of mapped LTG World3 scenario model space which so far has qualitatively held up very well.

One thing about exponentials is that late stage trajectory forcing is much more difficult than early stage forcing. Put in another words, the system is shedding degrees of freedom as it evolves. So this says us that a successful late stage strategy has to be more coercive, authoritarian. However, this will cause backpressure since there is no consensus across the agent population, which will likely manifest in civil disobedience up to the civil war and plain war. Latter will likely turn nuclear, and cause a depopulation event. This would be a partial reset.

Already emerging negative feedback is causing slowdown of growth which however is still in deep overshoot, even before collapse of fossil energy and food supply. Later depopulation event is associated with famine and pandemics, and also war. Also depopulation event. Also a partial reset.

So it kinda doesn't matter, we can't do much now, and arguably, collectively we never could.

So they're not ""communists"", but they're anti-capitalist. For obvious reasons. You don't need to have a moral objection against the exploitative nature of capitalism to see its practical problems.

Because we don't, there's no point in a revolution, communist or otherwise, but that doesn't mean that the ideals of communism/anarchism/socialism (loosely used) are one hell of a lot better than anything the (neo)liberal apologists of capitalism have ever produced.

I think you just need to get off your fucking high horse, your're not so much smarter than everyone else here. Just because I recognize that there's no way out for humanity in the grand scheme of the biosphere, doesn't mean that I as a person with critical thinking skills cannot determine for myself that anarchism/communism/socialism is a set of principles on how to structure a society that's miles and miles above the moral standing of capitalism.

And that is the reason why real socialism always becomes a dictatorship.","2017-12-05 21:01:22","0","[deleted]","1747880803.378703","climate doom","manual"

Honestly the only way the world can turn around, that is if it isn't already too late, is if we start caring about the environment more than personal freedoms. People are only going to make token actions like buying a Prius or something - they aren't going to willingly give up their easy lives full of luxuries. But if we're going to save the environment, people are going to have to get used to a *much* lower standard of living - that's just the reality of it. And not everyone can have a child - we need to reduce our populations quickly (which would happen naturally if we'd quit importing so many damn ""refugees."") If I were a Communist I would be an old-school one - the Bolsheviks would line the faggy SJW snowflakes that call themselves ""Communists"" these days against the wall and shot.","2017-12-06 09:15:11","0","NoSufferingIsEnough","1747880803.3799412","climate doom","manual"
