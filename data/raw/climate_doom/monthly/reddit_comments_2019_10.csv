I've read this kind of nonsense before, and wasted a lot of time researching it. It never pans out. Couple that with the fact that the climate models have done a passable job so far, not perfect (which is impossible anyway since it would require actual knowledge of things like future economic activity), but good enough. They are projections, not weather forecasts. 

Climate change is a demonstrated fact.

The human causes are demonstrated facts, primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The ratio of C13/C12 in atmospheric CO2 demonstrates that beyond any reasonable doubt.

"f2g2oxx","t3_dcwyvr","dcwyvr","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm generally sympathetic to certain criticisms of models of very complex systems. Generally I've found that the more you work with complex models, the more modest are the claims you tend to make about their outputs. 

When cutting-edge models use the best available data and the best available modeling techniques, that makes them *academically* valid. But only a well-defined set of predictions, compared against a well-defined set of empirical data and with errors rigorously quantified, can be considered useful for actual forecasting. So this passage in the linked article, I basically agree with:

>The climate models are useful tools for academic studies, he says. However, “the models just become useless pieces of junk or worse (worse in a sense that they can produce gravely misleading output) when they are used for climate forecasting.” 

The article goes on to give some reasoning for this conclusion:

>These models completely lack some critically important  climate processes and feedbacks, and represent some other critically important climate processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to the extent that makes these models totally useless for any meaningful climate prediction.

Okay, I guess that's fine. But actual scientists probably don't claim that their models are complete or even sufficient for forecasting. Climate scientists who are intellectually honest surely acknowledge the gaps that are noted here as criticisms. So framing that as a criticism is a little bit unnecessarily confrontational. It would be better to discuss the actual gaps in terms that an objective layperson can understand.      

>I am confident that some honest and courageous, true climate scientists will continue to publicly point out the fraudulent claims made by the mainstream climate science community in English.

Okay, this is also highly confrontational. I guess there probably are some such fraudulent claims being made — probably some academics do overstate the usefulness of model outputs as forecasts. And it's true that laypeople have a tough time identifying those overstated claims. I doubt it's really necessary to take a confrontational approach there, but I guess it's not wrong.

>Climate forecasting is simply impossible, if only because future changes in solar energy output are unknowable.  

While true, this isn't a very deep criticism of climate models. I would hope this is just a statement of convenience for the author's readership, and not a full summary of this climate scientist's views. 

More climate-model gaps pointed out:

>Other gross model simplifications include

>* Ignorance about large and small-scale ocean dynamics

>* A complete lack of meaningful representations of aerosol changes that generate clouds.

>* Lack of understanding of drivers of ice-albedo (reflectivity) feedbacks: “Without a reasonably accurate representation, it is impossible to make any meaningful predictions of climate variations and changes in the middle and high latitudes and thus the entire planet.”

>* Inability to deal with water vapor elements

>* Arbitrary “tunings” (fudges) of key parameters that are not understood

I'm glad to have this list written down for laypeople like myself. But this is just one step toward evaluating various criticisms of climate models. We don't know how significant any of these gaps really are. 

>Solar input, absurdly, is modelled as a “never changing quantity”. He says, “It has only been several decades since we acquired  an ability to accurately monitor the incoming solar energy. In these several decades only, it has varied by one to two watts per square metre. Is it reasonable to assume that it will not vary any more than that in the next hundred years or longer for forecasting purposes? I would say, No.”

This is a more comprehensive discussion of a small but important point. 

>Good modelling of oceans is crucial, as the slow ocean currents are transporting vast amounts of heat around the globe, making the minor atmospheric heat storage changes almost irrelevant. For example, the Gulf Stream has kept western Eurasia warm for centuries. On time scales of more than a few years, it plays a far more important role on climate than atmospheric changes. 

Interesting. I've wondered about this too. The ocean is definitely a more significant heat reservoir than the atmosphere, in terms of capacity. But in terms of altering existing heat flows...I don't know. A further discussion of that topic would be interesting.

>Proper ocean modelling would require a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution and a vast increase in computing power, probably requiring quantum computers. If or when quantum computers can reproduce the small-scale interactions, the researchers will remain out of their depth because of their traditional simplifying of conditions.

Okay, I'm generally sympathetic to this claim, if you leave out the stuff about requiring quantum computers. 

>The models are ‘tuned’ by tinkering around with values of various parameters until the best compromise is obtained. I used to do it myself. It is a necessary and unavoidable procedure and not a problem so long as the user is aware of its ramifications and is honest about it. But it is a serious and fatal flaw if it is used for climate forecasting/prediction purposes.

Yes, this is something that I've wondered about as an objective layperson, and no scientist's explanation of these tunings has seemed very complete or satisfactory to me. So I'm sympathetic to this criticism too.

>Ad hoc representation of clouds may be the greatest source of uncertainty in climate prediction. A profound fact is that only a very small change, so small that it cannot be measured accurately…in the global cloud characteristics can completely offset the warming effect of the doubled atmospheric CO2.

I think this is another example of a model gap which is freely acknowledged by climate modelers. But Dr. Nakamura may feel that those academic acknowledgments are omitted from public discussions, and he might be correct to feel that way. I kind of feel that way myself too, as a layperson.

>Accurate simulation of cloud is simply impossible in climate models since it requires calculations of processes at scales smaller than 1mm.” Instead, the modellers put in their own cloud parameters. Anyone studying real cloud formation and then the treatment in climate models would be “flabbergasted by the perfunctory treatment of clouds in the models.

Wow, accuracy down to one millimeter? That seems like an unreasonable expectation. But accuracy down to 1000 cubic meters seems like a reasonable threshold at which to define an accurate atmospheric model. I think the current modeling threshold is several orders of magnitude larger than this.   

>Nakamura describes as “moronic” the claims that “tuned” ocean models are good enough for climate predictions. 

Again, I think this is mostly a semantic disagreement. I don't think many modelers actually consider current climate models to be ""good enough"" in terms of *completeness*. I think current models are considered ""good enough"" in terms of ""the best outputs available, which can lead to the creation of more precise models in the future."" Probably no one disputes that future climate models will be considerably superior to current ones. Climate modeling at this stage is undoubtedly an iterative process.

>He says a large part of the forecast global warming is attributed to water vapor changes, not CO2 changes. “But the fact is this: all climate simulation models perform poorly in reproducing the atmospheric water vapor and its radiative forcing observed in the current climate… They have only a few parameters that can be used to ‘tune’ the performance of the models and (are) utterly unrealistic.” Positive water vapor feedbacks from CO2 increases are artificially enforced by the modelers. They neglect other reverse feedbacks in the real world, and hence they exaggerate forecast warming.

Interesting. But I think the only way to truly evaluate this criticism is by testing a superior model.

>The  supposed measuring of global average temperatures from 1890 has been based on thermometer readouts barely covering 5 per cent of the globe until the satellite era began 40-50 years ago. “We do not know how global climate has changed in the past century, all we know is some limited regional climate changes, such as in Europe, North America and parts of Asia.”  

I don't think climate modelers deny the limited coverage available in the data. Although perhaps Dr. Nakamura is again correct to point out that these limitations get omitted from public discussions of model outputs. 

>The take-home message is (that) all climate simulation models, even those with the best parametric representation scheme for convective motions and clouds, suffer from a very large degree of arbitrariness in the representation of processes that determine the atmospheric water vapor and cloud fields. Since the climate models are tuned arbitrarily …there is no reason to trust their predictions/forecasts.

A strong claim. But possibly very hard to rebut.

Overall, this is a very interesting and challenging article. It's probably overstating the case to say that mainstream climate scientists are on the wrong path. Dr. Nakamura's criticisms of model gaps do seem plausible, although I think climate modelers themselves would uncontroversially acknowledge the existence of many of these gaps. 

I guess the key question comes down to whether these gaps are properly disclosed in public discussions of model outputs. It seems plausible to me that Dr. Nakamura has the better of this controversy, since it seems to me that the public audience gets mesmerized by announcements of model outputs and has basically no attention span for discussion of the actual facts of atmospheric composition and trends, much less any discussion of model shortcomings.

>The Ozone layer will continue to deplete if the current uses of it doesn't stop.

Ozone production/use near the surface of the earth does not affect ozone levels in the stratophere, which is what we're concerned about when we talk about he ozone layer.

Ozone is produced in the stratophere when UV rays break apart oxygen molecules and the oxygen atoms (O) then combine with oxygen molecules (O2) to form ozone (O3). The problem is that we're producing and releasing into the atmosphere chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons) which are very good at breaking down ozone, and that's a bad thing.","2019-10-01 04:55:51","3","mrrp","1747904034.216653","climate doom","manual"
