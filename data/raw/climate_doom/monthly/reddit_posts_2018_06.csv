"8uo4s7","collapse","skeptical","Is it OK to enjoy myself while the world is on fire?","Mass shootings, violence, corruption, poverty and inequality are ravaging our planet. That without taking into account climate change. We feel powerless and doomed. I don't even want to fight anymore. I feel that because collapse is so imminent and there's no future, I should enjoy myself a little bit more. I've programmed a trip to Argentina and Uruguay in November. These would be the 11th and 12th countries I'll visit in my lifetime.

I feel selfish but there's nothing else I could do. The end is nigh. At least, I want to enjoy a little bit more before the explosion. I rally want to die before collapse starts. This world is a mess.","2018-06-28 22:45:08","66","93","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/8uo4s7/is_it_ok_to_enjoy_myself_while_the_world_is_on/","True","ed8907","1747886762.759918","climate doom","manual"
