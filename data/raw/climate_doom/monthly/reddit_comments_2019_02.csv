If one looks at the predictions, and digs in, most of them are based on what is known as the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8, which assumes that no one on the planet makes any attempt to reduce emissions, and in fact we abandon pretty much every energy system except coal.  This is what the Media calls the ""business as usual"" model, but should more accurately be called the ""we've lost our damn minds"" model.

Under this scenario, we're doomed and all of the horrible things you've read may very well come true.  Under any sane reading of the science, however, none of the horrible outcomes will come true any time soon, and probably won't come true, ever. 

We are currently more likely to be somewhere between the next two pathways. In these scenarios, we'll face some challenges, but nothing we can't adapt to.

Consider this: Syria has been in a state of severe drought for 15 years.  It is the worst drought in hundreds of years, and is likely driven by climate change.

The loss of livestock and crops from this drought made farming untenable.  About 1.5 million people left the country-side and came into the cities looking for work.

This created the civil unrest, which triggered the ongoing civil war.


The long and the short of it is that the planet will not be able to produce what it needs to feed the population.  Even if we managed to keep it under 2 degrees warming, we would still be looking at a series of climate-driven wars and mass migrations.

IMO, the more immediate thing to worry about is already playing out: mass migration. While not a sole cause, the mass migration of people from the Middle East, Africa and Central America are all exacerbated by climate changes in those countries. Many say the Arab Spring from a few years ago (that led to revolutions in Egypt, Lybia, Tunisia, Syria, etc.) ignited when a heat wave in Russia led to crop failures, which led to Moscow stopping exports of wheat, which led to price spikes in the Middle East, which led to riots, which led to war and mass migration.

However this is literally the first actually predicted ""**APOCALYPSE**."" Nobody has ever been able to successfully predict any apocalypse whatsoever(duh).  
1) We're all in agreement that if our energy consumption keeps rising at this same exponential rate, or even if it continues at the same rate (including every kind of energy  and how we source it and use it - from food to fuel) , this will bring about an eventual ""apocalyptic world,"" and perhaps even an actual apocalpyse where no-to few humans and human organizations survive. If we don't take active measures specifically to combat this, apocalpyse isn't a matter of ""if"" but ""when."" But yes, the actual apocalyspe isn't in 15 years. Not in our lifetimes either, probably not in our great grandchildren's lifetimes either. But, again, apocalypse is certain.

2) Now the ""when:"" if we're talking about a 12-15 year time scale, the frequency of natural disasters and the loss of landmass to sea will cause billions of dollars in damages, and hundeds of million displaced people as well. So it will be ""apocalytpic"" even then, at least for us, when all those poor distraught immigrants start banging on everybody's doorsteps. Remember, conflict in Syria resulted in around *10 million* displaced people, of which around *1 million* or so sought refuge in Europe, where the *740 million* Europeans collectively shit their pants. Climate change will do that to *hundreds of millions*, all over the world.   


Now, of course, you can skip #2 if you want. Cuz that's the worst case scenario: best case scenario maybe in 15 years you just never need to wear a coat again if you were already in a place with a moderate climate, like Spain or Greece or Japan, or Seattle. It's just not gonna get as cold in the winters, with maybe some natural disasters happening a bit more frequently, and a few unimportant, tiny islands lost. 

But that really does not matter: we now know literally what will end up destroying all of humanity, and we know its causes, and how to stop it, too. No priest, no prophet, no fortune teller, king, shaman, has ever been able to correctly predict an apocalypse (duh.) But our scientists have. They have predicted how the apocalypse wil slowly and surely come about, they have outlined possible risks and dangers that it will bring with it as it starts to grow, and they have also found the causes of this apocalypse, and detailed many list of ways to stop this apocalypse from actually taking place.  


And the apocalypse is man-made.

Yes, that's a fair assumption to start with.

>2) Is it caused by human intervention in the environment? It is hard to just say, ""the science"" points to yes, especially knowing first-hand, that there is an extreme amount of bias and subjectivity in drawing conclusions in any scientific study. That is precisely why we do not depend indefinitely on a single source for any cutting edge result. 

Fair points in general, although the comment about bias and subjectivity is misplaced. Scientific inquiry is almost always our best tool for drawing conclusions free of bias and subjectivity. While there's plenty of bias and subjectivity in climate discussions, almost none of it results from actual scientific claims. 

>Has literally any scientific study thoroughly assessed the possibility this is due to one of many, many astronomical perturbations of Earth's non-nominal rotation, oblateness, not-perfectly-elliptical and variably perturbed orbit, or effects of other celestial objects (ex. the Moon, Jupiter, potentially undiscovered objects in the LaGrange points of the Earth-Sun or Earth Moon systems, etc.)? Some mention astronomical effects very briefly (the most I have found is a single sentence that immediately rules this out as a possibility), but I have a very deep suspicion that they were not very thorough investigations. So as far as I have read, these things have not been addressed, and if you have anything to say otherwise, please share. My goal is to educate myself and make my own judgement call, not to blindly accept some biased researchers' opinion.

Investigations into these factors have been limited, but for good reason: If these factors were strong enough to influence the climate, then they would exert an even stronger influence over things in our neighborhood that are even easier to measure (orbits of the Moon and asteroids, for instance). 

Probably the main variable in this set is one you haven't mentioned: It's possible the sun's output will vary somewhat chaotically in the future, making it difficult to devise long-term projections. But evidence for chaotic solar output isn't very strong right now. You would have to find some really good evidence on that point to make a coherent case out of it. 

>3) Is this a bad thing? Will there be doom and gloom as a result?

You're right that reports on this issue are frequently overburdened with sensationalism. Poverty kills people much faster and in much greater numbers than climate effects do. Climate discussions which fail to give even greater weight to poverty issues are probably indulging in sensationalism. I think it's fine to just set this topic aside every time it comes up. This problem just doesn't lend itself to scientific analysis.

>4) Should the US be the primary entity held responsible for changing it? I strongly believe that it is quite naive and overstates our ability, let alone to even begin to understand how to positively influence a trend in such a complex system as the global environment. 

Nobody thinks the US is the dominant climate influence on Earth — I mean, the only people who might think so are some very egotistical Americans, who are completely ignorant of how large the globe and its population actually are. It's safe to ignore all those folks and instead just think for yourself. The global climate is a global issue; it's not responsive to individual decisions made by individual nations, with the possible exception of an oil state which sets wells afire in the open air (Iraq).

>Additionally, how can we rule out that this is not just a ploy for self-aggrandizement for the political left? 

In terms of global politics, the ""political left"" is a trivial influence. You can safely ignore that influence and, again, just think for yourself by focusing on actual facts and scientific analysis. 

>5) Is this a good thing? Since we will reduce the number of people dying from extreme cold, that certainly is not bad. Will an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to any other negative effects on the environment at large? 

Nobody really knows, but it's safe to say that if a climatic system is in equilibrium and then departs from that equilibrium, there will follow a period of adjustment in which established patterns — of ecosystem development, economic development, etc. — get disrupted. As a civilization, we're constantly in a state of low-level adaptation to change, but usually that change is economic or technological and our adaptation methods for that are pretty good. If ecosystems or environments change...our adaptation methods are more uncertain. Periods of adjustment to those changes can be rough, even temporarily chaotic. Chaos probably isn't ever a net benefit to civilization as a whole. Anticipating chaos is a difficult assignment, but sometimes it's worth trying anyway.","2019-02-27 15:27:37","2","DocHarford","1747894855.607306","climate doom","manual"

This skepticism of yours is well-founded: We probably have very little idea of what the state of the actual climate will be in 2080 or 2100. 

But people who think we have that predictive ability are, again, misrepresenting the actual science on the issue. Climatologists don't actually claim to be able to predict the state of the climate many decades hence. What they typically do is take a given set of initial conditions and then extrapolate them forward. 

This isn't really a ""prediction."" But it's still a useful exercise, because it can show how *sensitive* the climate is to certain (extrapolated) influences. Before about 1970, nobody had any idea how to measure ""climate sensitivity."" But now we've conducted a half-century of inquiries into this question, and we've produced a range of conjectures, some of them quite startling. 

Some of the conjectures are so startling that they practically demand intense further research — especially into complex systems like the atmosphere, the oceans, and biomass. That's where we're at right now: Climatologists have made an overwhelmingly strong academic argument that further research into certain environmental influences and systems is vitally important for reaching a certain level of understanding about the climate.

Unfortunately a lot of people have misinterpreted this academic argument as a matter of grave public urgency, which is probably a mistake — although it's understandable. And some scientists don't do much to emphasize that their conclusions are mostly useful for directing future research, not for directing actual public policy; this is also a mistake, and it's less understandable and more indicative of some bad faith. 

So if you want to get mad at someone for acting in bad faith here, you might be able to find a small handful of scientists who fail to properly restrain their public claims, or who fail to offer proper disclaimers about the limits of their models, predictions, etc. But in my opinion, that's probably a waste of time. Scientists aren't *really* responsible when people misunderstand and overstate their fairly modest scientific claims. It's really the fault of laypeople who insist on remaining completely ignorant of the incredible complexities and imprecisions of the process of making long-term predictions about colossally complex systems.

This means that some regions are experiencing *drops* in temperature, at least at certain times, while others are experiencing rises in temperature.  But overall, the global temperature is definitely rising.","2019-02-04 05:46:12","3","ZombieTonyAbbott","1747895909.8319092","climate doom","manual"

This is the real game of life. I wonder how many times the game has been played? What round are we in?

Have any of us made it to another galaxy before? Are they there... waiting for us? lol Or would they rather stay far away from us?

Have we always failed and are truly doomed to die on this lonely planet? Need  to figure out space travel on a much higher level than we understand today.

If not, we're fucked. We eventually harm the planet to the point where civilization collapses. And we start a new round... If we're lucky.","2019-02-03 21:36:38","-17","crypt0crook","1747895909.835998","climate doom","manual"
