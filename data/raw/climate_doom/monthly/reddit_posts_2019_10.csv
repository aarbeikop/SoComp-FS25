I googled his name to find out more but I'm only getting results from websites with questionable veracity. 

Here's the article:  https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2019/09/a-climate-modeller-spills-the-beans/

I have my doubts about the arguments made in the article but I wanted to run it by someone with more knowledge on the subject to be sure.","2019-10-03 20:49:14","9","29","0.72","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dcwyvr/has_anyone_heard_of_dr_mototaka_nakamura_he_says/","True","BlueDragonsEye","1747902956.661109","climate doom","manual"
"dpv0xc","climatechange","action-oriented","Can somebody critique this for me?"," Climate change is a fact and has been for 5 billion years -- the great holocene glacier retreat was 12,000 years ago.  We have been warming ever since -- it's called an interglacial period.  There have been five global warming events over the last 2 billion years.  They are short, about 10,000 years, few, and far between.  We are fortunate to live during one, not doomed.  Atmospheric carbon levels are now 400 ppm (a tiny trace amount) - at the end of the last glacial period levels fell to 180 ppm and 80% of the large animals on earth became extinct, wooly mammoths, giant tree sloths, saber tooth tigers, dire wolves, cave bears etc.  Atmospheric carbon levels much lower than that will result in the extinction of all life on earth -- and that is how all life will end - not from changes in the sun making the temperatures incompatible with life.  Two million years ago, during the miocene atmospheric carbon concentrations we 4000 ppm - Ten times that of levels today - but the average global temperature was only seven degrees higher than today.  What the miocene is known for is the explosion of complex life forms not their extinction.  People who don't agree that man is the cause of any significant contribution of global warming/interglacial period don't falsify data to make their point - did you hear the recent news that your so-called scientist who developed the ""famous"" hockey curve graph that blames man for unfavorable climate changes just lost a big court case because he couldn't produce any data to support his lie -- swallowed, hook, line and sinker by the ignorant masses who can't think very well.  The way he did it was to write an algorithm that extracted and compiled only the data that fit his curve -- ignore most of the data because it failed to support it.  Since you are so smart and knowledgeable about this subject I'm sure you can tell us non believers what the optimum temperature of the earth is -- looking forward to knowing that number - thanks","2019-10-31 22:20:29","0","11","0.42","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dpv0xc/can_somebody_critique_this_for_me/","True","Coconut-Agua","1747902991.067936","climate doom","manual"
"dlz5rk","climatechange","action-oriented","Are we doomed to fail in this situation?","No, really, are we?

(Perspective from where I am from: America) We can't seem to make up our minds, we allow reality tv stars (who provide no purpose) to use a Boeing 747 for less than 10% of what it can carry, We can't seem to make up our minds about the issue, as it dissolves into a pointless Red vs Blue debate. Nuclear Power is smeared as dangerous and unstable in both news, and entertainment. People make pointless decisions are made to make themselves feel like they are doing something. We have a high schooler and former bartender lecturing us on climate change, while giving no real answers, and the solutions that ARE proposed are laughable (Green new deal). We have a generation of people of decided that it's perfectly fine to continue and deny this because ""they won't be here to experience the issues."" Our media has created an attention span of 1 week at most, before moving on to another topic, it seems like its made to divide the people. 

Developing countries will have a higher standard of living as they develop, so they make more, consume more, and emit/pollute more. China and India continue to pollute, and as more people get cars, more factories are made, etc. Its going to become a nightmare.

So, are we doomed to fail?","2019-10-23 13:15:38","3","8","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dlz5rk/are_we_doomed_to_fail_in_this_situation/","True","ItsTheVantaBlack","1747903008.1476321","climate doom","manual"
"dem1p1","climate","scientific","[serious] Previous scientific predictions of catastrophe","This is in no way questioning the science of climate change or it's predictions. Nor is this meant as trolling, it's a serious discussion. I've got a subtler point to make. Throughout the 20th century there were a number of well-known scientific predictions that didn't work out as predicted. Let's look at four cases (there are hundreds) The cases looked at here tended to fall in two classes - cases where the world, in fact, responded to the prediction and mitigated the issue, and cases where the science was sound but new technologies or discoveries changed the game. 

Given the generally dire predictions about climate change, I believe this point could actually be a reason for hope, not based on scientific predictions themselves, but on things that those predictions may not have considered. Please hear me out.

Rachel Carson famously predicted a Silent Spring. Her science was spot-on, the cause was taken up by many others, and DDT was banned along with other pesticides were banned or regulated. So the prediction of a Silent Spring did not bear out. But fast forward 60 years, and we are seeing a precipitous drop in bird populations, not from DDT killing their food sources and causing thin eggshells, but from other factors - habitat destruction, windows killing migrating birds, and some other factors we haven't identified yet. Rachel Carson's specific prediction did not come to pass, thankfully. Her science did not include the factors that are now making a Silent Spring more likely. 

The scientific history of Peak Oil prediction is littered with the bodies of scientists who got it wrong. A key example was Hubbert, who's prediction that oil production in the US would peak about 1970 seemed spot-on for years, until new technology changed the game. Once again his science was spot-on and very predictive, but new technology he could not have predicted changed the parameters. 

Paul Ehrlich famously predicted imminent doom in his book The Population Bomb. Once again his science was good, but the Green Revolution was just getting under way, a new technology that made his points moot. For now.

In the late 1970's, new satellites detected a previously unknown hole in the Ozone layer. Scientific predictions, and observations in the tip of South America, predicted disastrous outcomes - crop failures, rising skin cancer rates. Wild animals becoming blind. The world responded with the Montreal Protocol, and now 40 years on we are seeing the Ozone hole receeding. Occasionally, noncomplaint polluters are caught violating these protocols, as happened in China in recent years. Thankfully, these very credible predictions did not play out. 

Do these cases in fact give us cause for some hope that the worst predictions of climate disaster will not come to pass, due to either effective mitigations by the world community, or unpredictable factors that even the best science cannot take into account? There is so much gloom and doom here, and a weekly post by some poor soul who's mental health is affected by anxiety, can this actually be a source of optimism? The rational science says we're heading for a train wreck. Is irrational faith in Humanity justified? Is such irrational faith actually required to keep us sane and focused in the right direction?","2019-10-07 16:44:22","1","6","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/dem1p1/serious_previous_scientific_predictions_of/","True","Henri_Dupont","1747903139.172695","climate doom","manual"

“The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the global financial system is backing carbon-producing projects that will raise the temperature of the planet by over 4C – more than double the pledge to limit increases to well below 2C contained in the Paris Agreement.


World leaders agreed in the Paris climate accords to keep the temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C.

But in a stark illustration of the scale of the decarbonisation challenge facing the world economy, Carney suggested companies had already secured financing from investors in the global capital markets – worth $85tn (£67.2tn) for stocks and $100tn for bonds – that will keep the world on a trajectory consistent with catastrophic global heating.”

Haha yeah no shit. Anyone who thinks the (inadequate) Paris Agreement has any chance of being met is delusional. The system is in runaway feedback loop mode where money is God and fossil fuels are the drug. 

Gonna be interesting in 8 years time when the IPCC report is just one line “We’re fucked”.","2019-10-15 22:30:18","469","70","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/difo01/bank_of_england_boss_says_global_finance_is/","True","Littlearthquakes","1747903827.944031","climate doom","manual"
