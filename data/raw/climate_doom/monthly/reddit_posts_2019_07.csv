[All joking aside here is a great article published in Nature two days ago about why setting climate deadlines is dangerous.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0543-4.epdf?shared_access_token=IemqaDXjp59Xe4vx9SYpMtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PHAItqILlRm_HHBm_TdKN2W4fclucYeFPP7FPSpe4YZCMx6e3jOvyKFNEN4tDVEsxhypkjCeaXw5HrYv5x1N4z6OOPAlKiCRowdURrPb_LMA%3D%3D)","2019-07-24 14:43:05","89","32","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ch927d/climate_change_18_months_to_save_the_planet_make/","True","Freeze95","1747900000.2262049","climate doom","manual"
"cb032g","collapse","skeptical","Most of humanity isn't aware of what really is going on","...they are at uni studying for a job that maybe won't exist, paying life insurances or other investments for their retirement they most likely won't experience, making plans, pretending nothing is happening, etc. I feel like in that one scene of Chernobyl, where the public is not informed yet, not noticing they are facing immediate danger.

And similiar to Chernobyl our situation is rather hard to understand. Because with tons of different scenarios it is a really complicated issue.

A lot of threads here in this subreddit are about coping. Because, yes, the truth is harsh. For me it is an obvious way to cope to get the word out and think of strategies to avoid the worst. Because even if extinction is part of most of our possible paths for the future, there are still versions that are survivable. With the action we take today, we decide which one will come true.

Because if people don't know the truth, they will keep making shitty decisions, including voting for leaders who stand for certain doom.

We're all in, and I prefer slim chances over none.","2019-07-09 12:15:28","480","277","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cb032g/most_of_humanity_isnt_aware_of_what_really_is/","True","altbekannt","1747900244.138061","climate doom","manual"
"c86ad3","collapse","skeptical","""We'll be fine, but our children will be fucked""","The quote in the title is a very prominent one, I've heard it the last time talking to a friend who thinks climate change will have a serious impact on us as a civilization, but it's so far in the future at least our generation basically won't have to worry about it personally affecting them. We are both millenials and live in a first world country in Europe. I still don't expect to be able to die of old age. Am I too pessimistic?

I think the majority of people are aware of climate change and agree that it will have negative consequences, however, I also believe that the vast majority of that part of the population is not in the slightest aware of just how bad and how fast everything can and propably will turn upside down. ""We live in such overabundance of consumerism where you can buy the most useless and luxurious goods and you expect me to believe we will have trouble finding food and water?"" (not an actual quote, but a likely thought process of those people).

People are worried that they won't be able to ski in the future, that the cute polar bears die out and that summers are going to be slightly more inconvenient for them and anything beyond that is just too abstract and too uncertain into the future doom and gloom scenarios. Friends I talk to scold me for making them feel bad when I suggest they should at least think about having kids because of climate change. Everyone expects to live a happy family life until they die of old age.

At least Gen-Z with their Fridays for Future movement are starting to be actually worried about their lifes (""I want you to panic"" - Greta Thunberg). Until they will be able to actively politically take action everything will be far too late. If even my generation doesn't care enough about climate change how should we expect Gen-X and Boomers to act?

Economic growth is still more important to politicians than the survival of our species. That's why they make compromises and try to retrofit our unsustainable consumerist lifestyle into a ""green future"" with wind turbines and solar panels. They can't accept that we maaybe have to stop consuming so much shit and leading such wasteful lifes - the wheels must be turning and always faster. Ben Shapiro makes fun of people like us and says shit like ""They want us to go back to the stone age."" and I'm just thinking even if that strawman was our only option to save us from 5°C+ warming it would still be far more preferable to what awaits us if we keep going.

Sorry for my rambling, this could be shorter and more coherent.","2019-07-02 07:30:31","135","75","0.98","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c86ad3/well_be_fine_but_our_children_will_be_fucked/","True","mongopeter","1747900465.0315058","climate doom","manual"
