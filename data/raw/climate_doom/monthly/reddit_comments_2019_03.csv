You are responsible for yourself. Not for the 300 million other Americans or 7500 million other humans. The choices and decisions that brought us here have been made by others not you. As someone who has not yet even voted, you have no call to bear the guilt of others. 

>I still eat meat, so I feel like a hug pile of shit, 

Be easy on yourself. Choosing chicken over beef will bring a large portion of the emissions cuts from changing diets to a more plant based one. You do not have to do it all at once. 

>I also have heard that climate change can not be fought and that we’re all doomed. 

I have had one on one chats with lead authors of IPCC chapters like Richard Betts. He is one of the worlds leading specialists on the carbon cycle. His frustration was that there is so much we can do and ""we are doomed"" story gets in the way of the real issues. For most westerners over the next 50 years, climate change will occasionally disturb your life with a flood, or a ban on watering your garden. We have hugely technically advanced societies that can adapt to a wide variety of circumstances. It is those who do not generate a large surplus of wealth to buy food on the global market or can afford the large civil engineering projects to mitigate against floods and droughts who will suffer once we go beyond the 2C guardrail.

When you look for hope in this sector, due to the contentious debating you will only find confusion and calamity. It’s a huge and debilitating issue (a meta-object) that relies on petrifying people so that business as usual can proceed. Don’t fall prey to the immensity but instead localise your resilience.

There is also a long line of hopeful burnouts who have tried to “save the world” and witnessed (apparently) little change.
However, each and every positive effort has meaning.

Try, instead of seeking hope, to develop your PURPOSE and from this a more personable, organic and sustainable hope can arise.

> and knowing I’m only making things worse has led me to have suicidal ideation.

You had zero say in your creation. Your existence is the fault of your parents, not you. Don't spend energy blaming yourself for something you had no control over. 

> I just want to stop thinking about all of it, to actually enjoy my life

This is easily doable. Just stop worrying about problems that'll never impact you to begin with. There's no need to worry about something until it's already an issue. Why burn yourself out over anticipation? Save that energy for when any impactful problems arise. 

> I’m absolutely to the point where I feel suicide is a good idea.

To be fair, this would be the best option according to tree humpers, but something a little healthier would be simply refusing to procreate. Don't subject life to this world. They'll inevitably feel pain, sadness, and anger. That's a bigger motivation than ""pollution"" ever will be. 

> I’m ashamed to be human and to be American, I just want this constant mental suffering my brain causes me to feel.

That's what people on the left will have you think. They try to get you to hate yourself for who you are. It took me a few years to see the true agenda of the left, and I'm glad I do. A ""my way or the highway"" attitude, combined with an ever-moving goal post makes for an incredibly easy decision to mock the same rhetoric I took as gospel. 

> climate change IS as bad as alarmists say

Not true. Hence, ""alarmists."" They're not willing to discuss. They want you to feel the same misery as they do. I refuse to be dragged down. Life is way too short for that bullshit!

"ei64t3y","t3_az25ki","az25ki","climate","scientific","They won't be able to go skiing. That's already happening. 

Ticks will migrate into and infest areas where they used to enjoy hiking. This is already happening.

Trees in their backyards and in the woods will die off at an increasing rate due to combined stresses from extreme weather and lethal insects/microbes that previously couldn't overwinter in their area. This is already happening.

Certain species in their gardens will die off for similar reasons to the trees. Other species won't bloom or fruit because the timing for insects pollinating them is thrown off by early springs/late frosts, etc. This is already happening.

Home foundations will increasingly be damaged by extreme weather. Over saturated soil that freezes and expands pushes foundations in, drought pulls the dry soil back from the foundations and they move outward. Cracks begin to form. Sometimes major ones. This is already happening.

These are things people will notice ""at home""-- unless it's pointed out to them, they won't associate it with climate change.

On a larger level, the issue won't be the warmth, so much as the destruction of the ecosystem. The globe is a finely tuned piece of machinery that took hundreds of millions of years to evolve its inter-related systems.

Here's one sequence for example:

In spring, plants will bloom at times they didn't used to, and insects will emerge earlier, so the birds that arrive to eat them won't have food. Because the birds aren't there to eat them, the insects will infest things at a larger rate than they used to, causing various plant species to be eaten at a higher rate. Some of those plants are also eaten by small mammals, but there will be fewer of them, so more of the small mammals will die off--just move that up the food chain, you see where it's headed. Meanwhile the plants that didn't get pollinated like they should won't fruit or set seed, so anything depending on that fruit or seed is also out of luck and by the way, that plant won't reseed itself now.

The ecosystems have evolved based on set patterns of weather: rainy season, cold season, hot season, etc. When the weather becomes so erratic that people say ""there is no normal for this time of year anymore,"" it means every living species on the food chain is going to be stressed. Where do you farm if you can't predict the frost, rain and spring? Where do you raise livestock if you can't rely on the water supply and livable outdoor temperatures? How do you generate hydro electric power without the hydro part? What will people in the valleys of the world do for water when there is no spring runoff from snow melting on the mountains?

These problems are already occurring all over the world. Unfortunately, the media isn't reporting much of it if it doesn't happen ""here"" and they're not connecting the dots that they're all symptoms of the same disease.

Look up how many trees were killed in an unprecedented flood in Italy. Or how many cattle died in Australia's post-drought floods. Look up the ski resort in Chacaltaya, Bolivia and see how it's doing.

For all these ""isolated"" things, add ""coming soon to a community near you"" because they will. It's not a matter of ""if"" climate change will wreak havoc in your town. It will. You just don't know when.

Edit: Changed heatwave to post-drought flood. Got my eco-disasters mixed up.

Edit II: One thing I forgot, because it's tangential, but a BIG one to baby boomers. Tell them to ask their kids if they plan on having children of their own. Lots of millennials and GenZ are opting out because of climate change. If a boomer thinks they'll miss out on grandkids because of their inaction, they might sit up and take notice. I've seen a few people who thought it was all hyperbole till they realized ""no grandkids for YOU."" Changes their attitude instantly.

Edit III: (Last one, I promise.) If you're talking to business/finance oriented people, I just came across a great financial trend to cite (legit source NOAA, a government agency):

>In 2018, there were 14 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States. These events included 1 drought event, 8 severe storm events, 2 tropical cyclone events, 1 wildfire event, and 2 winter storm events. Overall, these events resulted in the deaths of 247 people and had significant economic effects on the areas impacted. The 1980–2018 annual average is 6.2 events (CPI-adjusted); the annual average for the most recent 5 years (2014–2018) is 12.6 events (CPI-adjusted). During 2018, the U.S. experienced an active year of billion-dollar disaster events including the 4th highest total number of events, only behind the years 2017, 2011 and 2016. In 2018, the U.S. also experienced the 4th highest total costs ($91 billion) only behind the years 2017, 2005 and 2012.
