Won't be in 60 years either, we are in the exponential part of the curve which means that things will go downhill multiple times quicker and faster...","2019-09-28 01:13:16","5","dreamz705","1747901797.4991941","climate doom","manual"

"f1zzaen","t3_dbb5n2","dbb5n2","collapse","skeptical","Very impressive write up—only thing I raised an eyebrow at is your short-term prognostication of humans maintaining their edge over crop failures—if the climate breakdown continues like we are seeing this year, I think they are going to get widespread a lot faster than your timeline, which is going to cause some big ripples. Hope I’m wrong.","2019-09-30 14:12:29","48","[deleted]","1747902650.611485","climate doom","manual"

"f209c8e","t3_dbb5n2","dbb5n2","collapse","skeptical","This is great. Your dedication to understanding our wicked situation is admirable. A few more things to consider, which are impossible to predict, are the thawing out of old pathogens, the evolution of diseases, and the changing of disease vectors.

I don't know how much thinking has been done on the last two items except the spread of mosquitos, but consider how rapidly microbiotic environments are going to be evolving given the stress organisms are going to be under given the rapid changes of ecosystems. The interactions between organisms are also going to be wildly different as populations change and migrate, which suggests new disease vectors.

Could be some major black swans here.","2019-09-30 15:21:44","27","AArgot","1747902650.617712","climate doom","manual"

"f20q13t","t3_dbb5n2","dbb5n2","collapse","skeptical","I like it, however I would say 2 things are missing/off. You don't mention greenland at all, which will be melting at an alarming rate, esp once a BOE event occurs. This will raise the oceans faster than Antarctica will at least until Antarctica starts to really melt... which is 2050+.

India will 100% run out of water around 2025. First nation to collapse.

Also the ocreans will be 150% more acidic by 2050. This kills a lot of ocean life. Certain species are having issues today because of it. 

Also based off the data it looks like a BOE will now occur between 2025 - 2029. once this ice is gone and is unable to cool the oceans, the artic oceans will absorb the sun and heat up 80x faster.

And as a side note, everyone is worried about hard/mineral/energy resources. However i'd like to argue we will run out of food worldwide before we hit these resource limits. Aka by the time we are about to hit resource limits, we will have already lost 6.5 billion people (50% of our food will be destroyed by climate change), thus those resources will now last much longer with only a billion people on earth left. the only places left to live will be near the poles/west Antarctica. majority of all factories and enegry plants will be shutdown at this point and the aerosol dimming effect will vanish, giving us another +2c added on to our already +4c at 2050.

And war will definitely break out in Asia. I suspect will will be india and pakistan will go to war over water like you mentioned. I just think it will happen around 2030.
