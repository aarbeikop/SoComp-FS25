> 4 If we are about enter a new ice-age within the next 500-2000 years, is it possible that human-made global warming could be used to stabilise global climate to prevent a new ice-age from happening at all?

You may be interested to know that exactly this point was made by one of the pioneers of global warming theory, Guy Callendar, in 1938! 

In a now-famous paper, at the end, he wrote:

""In conclusion it may be said that the combustion of fossil fuel, whether it be peat from the surface or oil from 10,000 feet below, is likely to prove beneficial to mankind in several ways, besides the provision of heat and power. For instance the above mentioned small increases of mean temperature would be important at the northern margin of cultivation, and the growth of favourably situated plants is directly proportional to the carbon dioxide pressure (Brown and Escombe, 1905). In any case the return of the deadly glaciers should be delayed indefinitely.""

"e8cuy6e","t3_9qz367","9qz367","climatechange","action-oriented","1. Yeah, I'd have to agree there

2. I think you're statement here isn't quite correct, as the changes we are making are not small at all. I think what you're getting at is the changes we are making can amplify the effect such as in the case of feedback loops. If the climate starts to already 'run away' because of small changes then it is less likely that a small change could reverse it. For example, as sea ice melts, there is less surface area to reflect the sunlight and even more heat is absorbed. It can go the other way though with things like increased water evaporation from ocean making more clouds which helps to reflect sunlight. It is very complicated how all these positive and negative feedback loops work together, but most are taken into account with climate modelling and the models show the earth getting warmer despite this. If a small adjustment could reasonably reverse climate change, we'd know about it. 

3. For one, I don't think we'd be doomed. I mean, it would be pretty bad, but it would take a lot to wipe the human race out at this point because of the technology we've developed. And yeah you're right, but this is still a very long (and uncertain) time away and we can't just say fuck it now because we are adapted to our current world and deviating from this will cause unecessary problems. It is within our best interest (economically and other) to maintain our current climate for as long as we can. 

4. Possibly! But I think there is far too much uncertainty to plan for something like this. It is less risky to try and prevent climate change. 

5. I guess so, but you shouldn't ignore or stop learning about it. It's an economical and political issue now, but the longer we leave it, the less we can rely on mitigating measures (reducing CO2) and the more we will be forced to use adaptive measures (building dykes or desalination plants). This is more risky and costly. Don't worry, on an individual level you will be fine and humans are not going to go extinct. But you still need to stay invovled in the conversation to help reduce the impacts. Keeping talking about it and voting wisely is the best way to make a difference. Sure, on a personal level you can reduce meat consumption or the amount you drive, but even though I still do these things, they're not going to make a difference in the scheme of the world. Especially when India, Africa and China have billions of people that want a western standard of living and currently fossil fuels is the cheapest and easiest way to provide this.

"e8cxfe7","t3_9qz367","9qz367","climatechange","action-oriented","1. Absolutely agree. I was saying this before I came to Reddit, and I've been here nine years!

2. Correct. Often missed.

3. Eh, maybe. To be a little pedantic, we are in an ice age now and have been for the last 2 million years. We see long glacial periods with brief interglacials in between. We mostly get the physics of these cycles. 

4. Yes! Very frankly, CO2 levels won't persist for 2,000 years, so if humanity manages to maintain enough population and technology, we should be well equipped to prevent the next glacial period.

5. I think you misjudge the climate science community based on some of the louder voices, and you also are perhaps missing what good researchers are doing in the background to produce the means of reaching a zero carbon future.

&#x200B;

i actually believe that man-made changes (if any) has diminishing return. for example, the effect of CO2 emission reflects diminishing return. but we produce more of it at exponential growth - for now anyways.

&#x200B;

furthermore, i believe other factors carry much more weight. theres been large number of extinction  or near extinction events in the past. the cause of which are poorly understood, and these factors could easily eclipse human activities by large margins.","2018-10-24 15:53:49","1","SQQQ","1747889979.034938","climate doom","manual"
"e8fq89e","t3_9qz367","9qz367","climatechange","action-oriented","Hi. I guess I wanted to input as well

1. We are past ""debate"" point for many results of climate change. You don't ""debate"" gravity, unless you have a very specific interest in, say, quantum gravity, which still won't affect the fact that things fall down. A starting point for any debate is the science. My favorite site is http://climate.nasa.gov  although the IPCC AR5 is more complete.
These understood science results aren't something that reddit debates....

2. Th human generated change is gigantic. That's why any program also has to be gigantic, and at the very least, include a very large percentage of renewable energy

3. 100 million years ago, the continents were in significantly different positions, making a simplistic compare (the only kind of work we can do on reddit) inappropriate. However, there's extensive scientific literature showing how we are way hotter than any time in the past several million years, and that our release of GHG is responsible. That's a point I simply have to state your position on this is scientifically incorrect; we have a great deal of relevant paleo-climate studies

4. Theres neither scietific nor historical reason to assume we will be entering a new ice age. Even if we were there's no scientific data to show that our CO2 pollution will help.
One example, many people suggest that CO2 is ""plant food"" (true from a certain perspective, but irrelevant) because the scientists show us that increasing the planet's CO2 yields smaller, more expensive harvests

5. I have a comment on this I'll keep to myself, but my evaluation of your positions may be no  more accurate than yours.
