This guy says we're 100% doomed and no doubt about it...but has a kid anyway. Nope. That's not what you'd do if you'd been told that there was an unstoppable, world-killer asteroid on a trajectory to hit the Earth. Progressives say that only immediate, total commitment can save us...but they include stuff about labor unions and ""indigenous rights"" and universal health care in their plans, and refuse to increase nuclear.

Progressives largely control sciences that intersect with progressive political preferences. They control sociology, anthropology, most of psychology...so I would be absolutely not surprised at all if they are very influential in climatology. All they have to do is make something the progressive orthodoxy and...hey, wadday know???...suddenly the progressive-friendly sciences ""discover"" that they're right! 

When people who claim we're doomed start acting like they really think we're doomed...and when people who claim to think that only an all-out commitment against carbon can save us start acting like they actually believe it...then I might believe it.","2019-01-21 03:05:14","11","MosDaf","1747893101.538814","climate doom","manual"
"eelup2d","t3_ai2kvp","ai2kvp","climatechange","action-oriented",">	Indeed, taking Wynes and Nicholas’s argument seriously would mean acknowledging that the only truly moral response to global climate change is to commit suicide. There is simply no more effective way to shrink your carbon footprint. 

This is wrong. A person can quite easially have negative emmissions. It is much better to work and earn a wage. Use the money to invest in Renewable Energy and carbon offset. It will cost about $2000 for a normal american to offset ones CO2 emmissions each year. 

I would say the most effective way an induvidual can help beat climate change is:

1) Work with something constructive, such as installing new reneeable energy

2) Be frugal and don’t waste CO2, dont fly etc.

3) Offset your CO2 emissions, with for example biochar that really do put carbon back into the ground.

4) Invest as much money as possible in building more renewable energy.

"eene5q5","t3_ai2kvp","ai2kvp","climatechange","action-oriented","I stopped when he said ""over the next 20 years"" like that's at all a reasonable timeline. I've seen stuff from this guy before, he shares the sentiment of many other scientists on this subject. We have 10 years give or take a year to regrow Arctic ice and restore polar votices or life on this planet will be wiped clean, not just humans.

Happy to elaborate, feel free to view my post history for links and things. Believe me, or don't but I can tell you assuredly this is the timeline we have in front of us and anything outside of that is a fairytale. It's not a matter of belief, its thermodynamics. My wife and I did a heroic dose of mushrooms for the purpose of weeding out the clutter in our brains and for the sake of coming to grips with this reality. 

It's a strange timeline to be birthed into, it's downright unbelievable. But it's important to plan and expect this, because people being unprepared for harsh realities is how you end up traumatized and reeling. Make the most out of every day, 10 years is a long time to find a solution. Until then, don't live life in worry because is frivolous, spend your time being the best you for yourself and others.

Sadly, yes. I see the same rhetoric get repeated over and over again; a lot of which is simply copy + pasted from post to post. If you see anyone use the word ""hopium"" for example, you can be pretty sure they're a follower of Guy McPherson. Unfortunately these fringe views tend to dominate a lot of online discussions on climate change since these individuals tend to be the ones to seek out climate change articles and comment on them. It misleads people into thinking that such extremely pessimistic predictions are the scientific consensus on climate change.

"ed44rf9","t3_abx5s0","abx5s0","climatechange","action-oriented","Human extinction is inevitable - the universe itself has a finite lifespan - the question is only when.  Humans live in a wider range of environments than any other species, even cockroaches, so I would be surprised if climate change alone wiped us out in the next few hundred or thousand years.

That said, I think any rational person is also somewhat worried that the effects of climate change will be worse than consensus science predicts, because the perceived effects so far have been greater than predicted, because of the difficulty in modelling second-order ""feedback"" effects, and most of all, because of the seeming likelihood that the world's nations will fail to act to hit the targets that are necessary to keep global warming from being catastrophic.

Just like science denialism — in fact doomsaying is another *form* of denialism, characterized by exaggerating the claims of science instead of dismissing them.

"ed56073","t3_abx5s0","abx5s0","climatechange","action-oriented","I would say I have observed a similar pattern on discussion of other topics. 

""Peak oil"" was a very popular idea about 10 years ago that was dominated by ""doomer"" types who were convinced we were on the brink of a collapse of civilisation. Near term economic collapse of the modern economy through variations of ""fiat money"", ""debt"" and other mechanisms have a strong online following. Going back a good few years, over population was often held as bringing near term collapse due to over farming, lack of food etc. 

In climate change there have been iterations of ""deep ocean clatherates"" in the late 90, ""Gaia's Revenge"" in the mid 2000s, Methane (again) this time from the ""East Siberian Arctic Shelf"" was the rage in the late 2000s, early 2010s. 

&#x200B;

Perhaps when confronted with a complex problem with a variety of possible outcomes, some people jump to worst case scenarios to subconsciously simplify it while maximising their personal kudos from ""getting"" the severity. They can tend to master details over a very narrow area of the field but tend to lack a broad approach.
