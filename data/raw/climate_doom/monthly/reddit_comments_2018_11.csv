I would suggest to you that appearance of similarity regarding other ""incorrect"" environmental issues most likely is due to your receiving information primarily from sources which present it as similar to other environmental issues, which they then declare (correctly or not) were wrong.

> And even global warming has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations 

Nope, it's been the same for over one hundred years: CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases warm the planet's surface. Therefore increasing CO2 warms the planet's surface.","2018-11-05 14:12:42","3","skeeezoid","1747891008.582507","climate doom","manual"

"e93zrv7","t3_9ud5pr","9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","You're right it has happened numerous times. And you are correct nature has bounced back. However, all those events took place over several thousand years.

This even will take place over several hundred. Neither nature nor organisms can adapt over a course of hundreds of years. If they do bounce back, it will be a drastically smaller amount of flora and fauna. If that happens, how do you prepare to feed the vast majority of people? How do you ensure the ecosystem stays stable?

That's the main focus: thousands of years yes you can adjust but hundreds, nature certainly cannot. I know this first hand. Snooker season was basically canceled in fort Myers in 2010 or 11 because a quick spike in temperature killed over 800 of this fish. I remember because it was a major news story. 

As I said nature can adapt but it cannot adapt in a short amount of time and that is what is occurring now. It is a normal process, but it is occurring TOO quickly compared to the past.","2018-11-05 18:51:32","1","KarakitIshtari","1747891008.59274","climate doom","manual"
"e94mijo","t3_9ud5pr","9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","I notice lately there is a lot of emphasis on the rate of increase of global temperature. 

We only have records for the last 170 years or so. Initially these were very scant records of global climate. Now we have data from the best available instruments. As good as the data is it represents only a small sample of the reality of the climate. 

Pre 1850 we have only proxies. The data is not a continuum but averages over a time period. The further back the greater the time period of averaging.

Averaging data removes the peaks and troughs. Rates of change can only be determined by that of the average. Fluctuations within the averaging range can not be determined.","2018-11-05 23:57:55","1","NewyBluey","1747891008.595565","climate doom","manual"

These kind of posts only delay further action on climate change. Making people confused, and think the situation is less dire. Which it’s not. You really need to get off your computer and go out in the real world and see what’s really happening. Also if you want the facts. Snow extent in the northern hemisphere is on the decline (in spring and summer) and on the rise in fall and less so in winter. There is more water vapor in the atmosphere. And there is still cold weather. One thing you seem to not understand is climate is not weather. As far as people saying all snow will disappear, we’re not there yet. Once we get a BOE, and warm a bit more. That will be more likely. We’re leaving the interglacial and heading for hot house. Yes, snow will be a thing of the past eventually. Just because it hasn’t happened yet doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Fuck off to your trump loving den","2018-11-21 06:22:19","16","collapse2050","1747891321.108991","climate doom","manual"

"ea6gsy4","t3_9yz1w9","9yz1w9","collapse","skeptical","Given that things keep ending up worse than predicted before, I'm not so sure on being all that optimistic. You do realize that the term ""climate change"" isn't a new one in the field, right? Scientists have talked about how climates vary and what affects these variances since the late 1800s. Now our data and understanding certainly has improved, but the key points that climate science is centered around really hasn't. Any sense of it being a new thing that scientists are ""now"" talking about is just the media jumping on what sells readers/viewers. Usually they don't give science a second look, it's too boring.

You mention some false hits that we survived, like acid rain or ozone loss. There's reasons why those things changed, of course, and it wasn't because they weren't (aren't) a problem. They can also come right back (ozone may be, thanks to lack of regulation in some places), although compared to other issues they might take a back seat this time.

I think there's two alarmists. The one that jumps on any scare as being the end of the world because they want to be part of the ""in-the-know"" crowd, aka the conspiracy fanatic. Then there's the one who is labeled an alarmist because they're pointing out some actual serious problems that are either too large scale, too hard to grasp, or too inconvenient to see for others. I hope you're trying to warn about being one of the first types, and not being too general and saying anyone who discusses the path we're on is just full of it. The data is there, it's not good. We can and do certainly debate on interpretation of how bad, of when, of who will get affected and how others might avoid problems. But it's not some hoax or made up story, things are changing for the worst.","2018-11-21 17:58:53","3","Rhaedas","1747891321.119665","climate doom","manual"
