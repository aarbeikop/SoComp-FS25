Freeman Dyson is once again interviewed about Climate Change (among other things). He basically warns Americans that we are getting ahead of ourselves when it comes to climate change and is quoted as saying ""Obama took the wrong side on climate change""

So, this isn't the first time Freeman Dyson has been discussed on here, but I'm curious as to what r/environment thinks about this recent article. His stance is; climate change is just another trend in people worrying about our impending doom that dates back to WWI, and that the problem isn't as bad as others make it out to be. He even offers a solution of inducing snowfall in Antartica, which caught my attention. 

The whole interview is fairly interesting  (though I think the interviewer was easy on him).

This is my first time posting here, so I should make note that I believe climate change is real.
