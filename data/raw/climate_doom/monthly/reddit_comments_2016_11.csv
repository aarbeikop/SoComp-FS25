While this is usually a cause for concern, it might be a cause for hope in current times:

 * Solar production doubles every two years (about 50% per annum). With a little bit of luck, it will provide about 4% of the worldwide electricity production in 2020.
 * Wind production doubles every three to four years (about 30% per annum). With a little bit of luck, it will provide about 5% of the worldwide electricity production in 2020.

While 9% (in total) might not sound impressive, it's quite a change if you add hydro and the rest of nuclear. It means tons of jobs for renewables and possibly nuclear, while coal will drop.

Meanwhile, the future for electric cars looks good with Tesla's Model 3 and GM's Bolt released next year. Prices for batteries are falling. If self-driving cars take off, one electric car might replace two or more gasoline cars.

Addtionally, it will continue to get warmer, more and more people will become afraid, thereby increasing the chances for political change during the next four years.

In other words, the chance that the next US government will be no climate change denier and that it will be willing to do something drastic should increase in the next four years.

While the 66% chance of staying below 1.5°C will be lost in about 5 years, the 66% chance of staying below 2°C will be lost in about 20 years, so there's still a slight possibility to keep that line.","2016-11-10 15:46:47","13","[deleted]","1747866002.162498","climate doom","manual"

"d9uqshr","t3_5c7tp8","5c7tp8","climate","scientific","1. If the arctic holds for a bit longer we might enter another mild hiatus. If that happens we might have up to 15 years before another peak comes that completly eclipses the last 3 years.  But as soon as the arctic goes its a tipping point.

2. Trump will have to ackowledge climate change. There is no choice for him. Senators and congress people have the choice to ignore the advise of the executive agencies but the president have too.

3. If the arctic does not hold we will be too busy dealing with the consequences ro even debate climate change. It will merely be survival of the fittest. ","2016-11-10 19:28:00","4","Archimid","1747866002.167806","climate doom","manual"
"d9vak9c","t3_5c7tp8","5c7tp8","climate","scientific","Its not about Trump. What most ppl do? Not care. Most ppl know its happening, thats it. They might see a documentary or somethin and thats it.

We need some scientist based organisation that will start pulling all the ppl together. Politicians wont do it cause they dont understand shit and care about theirs power issues, normal citizen has his/her own problems so the scientist who knows how the real danger really looks like is imo the person to get us united.

And if ppl would go as one no Trump etc. could stop it.

My biggest problem with doomsday scenario is - we adapt. Its also hope, a bit. We can adapt to whatever comes but we already adapted to not caring, me me me attitude individualistic capitalism. As society I mean. So noone really cares. I hope I will care and do more in recent future. But... im human too. So I adapted. :D","2016-11-11 02:29:55","2","Bloody_Ozran","1747866002.170017","climate doom","manual"
