"b3ntwp","climatechange","action-oriented","I can’t do this anymore","No matter how much concern and wishes to help fight climate change, I still feel like a total piece of shit, like I’m worthless, and that it won’t help. I still eat meat, so I feel like a hug pile of shit, and knowing I’m only making things worse has led me to have suicidal ideation. I also have heard that climate change can not be fought and that we’re all doomed. I just want to stop thinking about all of it, to actually enjoy my life (only 15 years old). I’m absolutely to the point where I feel suicide is a good idea. 
I’m ashamed to be human and to be American, I just want this constant mental suffering my brain causes me to feel. My brain makes me think that no matter how much therapy I have, climate change IS as bad as alarmists say. It’s been fun knowing y’all. I’m unsubbing. My obsession with climate change is ruining my life. I feel like my mind is slipping away.","2019-03-21 07:58:54","45","31","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/b3ntwp/i_cant_do_this_anymore/","True","Sylveon_Fan","1747896367.6391182","climate doom","manual"
"az25ki","climate","scientific","What are the first things caused by global warming non-scientific people will start to notice, which will have a real negative impact on their lives?","I'm looking for things that are news-worthy, and could really start to attract the attention of citizens and the media.

For example, news about the fauna and other rise in average temperature don't have a negative impact on people's live because they might not be science-litterate, and it might not change how they eat and consume.

What are the first events or of the most obvious signs that people will notice that are caused by global warming?

PS: my question was both removed in /r/askscience and /r/explainlikeimfive

I'm looking for an realist, scientific, ""alarmist"" but not paranoiac ""doom and gloom"" answer. I've heard nobody can really answer how human society will answer to problems and where it's going to result in crisis, since there are butterfly effects.","2019-03-09 10:26:35","672","258","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/az25ki/what_are_the_first_things_caused_by_global/","True","PenisShapedSilencer","1747896493.965526","climate doom","manual"
