"cupbig","climatechange","action-oriented","Positive action","It seems that every day the news about the environment is all about gloom and doom.  I would like to create a list of actions/decisions people make every day that make a difference. 

 Over the past few years, I have made small changes in my household hoping to make a difference, however small: I do not use plastic bags, I carry my own water bottle instead of using disposable bottles, I fly only when absolutely necessary (this one is very difficult), I cook at home as much as possible (I go out to dinner once or twice a month) and for the past 4 months I have managed to avoid take out.

I would like to know what other people are doing, climate change is real but I believe it is our small individual daily decision that can create change.","2019-08-24 05:10:37","7","8","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cupbig/positive_action/","True","Humom2dox","1747900609.854025","climate doom","manual"

That different people that are talking about, extinction, collapse, climate change, peak oil, etc. I didn't check them, but he explained me that we're pretty screwed whatever we do, that our deadline is the melting of the North Pole, causing some serious feedback loops that would cause our extinction. It was timed for the last year, but we still have it, but the end of the ice in the summer is predicted to be no long after 2022-25.

He was a journalist, not scientist, but he seemed pretty well-informed. I asked him about IPCC and he said that they don't take into account a lot if important variables. BTW he advocated to struggle wherever we can, but knowing that we're doomed, keeping empathy and defending human dignity beyond everything.

So my questions are: from the list, the ones that work with climate change, are reliably? Are we so real doomed in so few years? My brain just can't cope with this.","2019-08-22 12:15:00","0","2","0.25","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/ctwl33/imminent_extinction/","True","victorav29","1747900666.2439208","climate doom","manual"
"ckmlty","collapse","skeptical","Top 20% = 70% Emissions | Ignoring Billionaires Will Kill Us All","So Katy Perry flew to Sicily to tackle climate change. I feel safer already. Leonardo Dicaprio, who was involved with the Malaysian oil corruption scandal, is going too. For a guy who sank on the Titanic, he sure likes his yachts.

These people are not virtuous because they're rich, in fact, it's quite the opposite. Adulation of them is exactly what's wrong with our society. How many homes, planes, yachts and cars does one person need?

Oil and gas are their primary sources of wealth. The latest gold rush is data, and this elite climate camp is sponsored by Google. Yet if IT were a country, they would be the 3rd largest emitter in the world. How many IOT devices do we actually need? Answer: none. Do we really need ""smart diapers""?

If Bernie Sanders became president and raised taxes on billionaires (which I doubt he'd actually do), how many of those same billionaires would be in line, with their hands out, trying to get rich ""fighting"" climate change? Answer: All of them. Do you remember Elon Musk's Solyndra solar panel fiasco? What good are falling solar panel prices if they won't actually solve anything?

The reason that ""progressive"" billionaires promote carbon taxes is because they can afford them, plus they'll be positioned to make even more money off of the tax handouts. Even the idea that billionaires promote socialism should give you reason to pause.

When president Marchon of France raised fuel taxes on everyone ( to fight climate change ), he cut taxes for billionaires at the same time. You can't fight climate change on the backs of the poor. That's how we got the Yellow Vest riots.

If you're a low-income earner ( the bottom 40% ) would you pay more taxes to fight climate change? If you said, yes, then you're more noble than 99% of us. But why not get paid to fight climate change? Especially if you're poor.

James Hansen proposed such a thing 10 years ago. If taxes on the rich were 100% private, and paid 100% back to the poor, we could slay 2 birds with 1 stone. A 100% private carbon wealth tax means that NGOs, corporations and governments would get 0%. 

Both socialists and capitalists hate this idea. When James Hansen first proposed this idea, Bernie Sanders sponsored a law that would allow the federal government to steal 40% of any such private tax, way back in 2011.

I am very aware of how unpopular this idea is. I do not understand it, but I'm very aware of it. It is this awareness that leads me to conclude that no one is serious about fighting climate change, which leads me to conclude we're totally doomed.

Am I claiming that 100% private carbon wealth taxes will save the world? No, I only promise it will stop profligate consumption and help the bottom 40%. I know in my heart of hearts it will never happen, but it's the little things that keep me alive, no matter how irrational.

100% private carbon wealth tax = 100% private UBI

100% private carbon wealth tax = 0% for governments, corporations and NGOs.","2019-08-01 10:32:19","603","93","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ckmlty/top_20_70_emissions_ignoring_billionaires_will/","True","CommonEmployment","1747900957.223099","climate doom","manual"
