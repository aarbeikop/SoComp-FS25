A funny thing happened earlier with my housemate, he talked about the last white rhino that died and I started to talk to him about the need for the population to lower their carbon footprint, he agreed while cooking a burger with meat from the supermarket. The kind of meat I know was fed with grain from halfway across the world. He left with a smile thinking he was acting for climate change, nobody knows what reducing their carbon footprint means.

I agree completely with every word you say except that the climate isn't ""doomed"".  An unprecedentedly large number of people will die and it will be horrible, but humans are even tougher than cockroaches - many will survive.  Many animal species will also survive.  However, it's going to be a catastrophe of inconceivable proportions and I'm glad I'm too old to rational expect to live to see it.

You're not alone, in-fact that's what I imagine the majority of this community is secretly trying to avoid by connecting with like minded folks.  That means, at worst you're in the company of 59,725 people (and counting).

This is the worst time to be giving up, in-fact, it's the perfect time to use that negative energy to turn it into something positive.  I share some of your same frustrations, I even believe some of the same things, but I don't think that means I can't make a positive difference even if it's just within the distance my arms reach.  
  
Life is a terminal disease, in-between we get the opportunity to influence our environment.  Even if your environment is as small as your neighborhood, or just your block, or even just your own home. 
 Your effort can/will (studies have shown to be true) inspire other people to do the same thing.  Live well, while you can, help those you love, and keep pushing for change on the ideas you care about.  In the end, maybe it doesn't matter to anyone else, but it will matter to you and you'll get to die knowing you did everything within your power to positively influence your environment and the people you surrounded yourself with.  

Or, give up, and live in the environments other people create for you.  Maybe that doesn't matter in the end either, I don't honestly know.  I just choose to know, even if life ends today suddenly, that I got to do the things I wanted to do while I could, for the reasons that best suited me.
  
I hope you do the same.","2018-03-21 15:36:32","2","n1njabot","1747883746.559912","climate doom","manual"

so I started to look around, I looked into all kinds of topics. I think that saving the biosphere is the most important thing we should concentrate upon. you can boil it down to cheap useable energy and climate energy balance.

in fact, I even got more insight then I ever dreamed to understand. there are 2 ways of accomplishing something: you just try it massive in parallel with lots of resources and time or you have a very well understanding of the process and can develop through thinking and calculations and only need to test very little.

humans have strange thinking patterns. for example, you can easily see something different in psychology, or biology but if you question something on physics, you are basically instantaneously a crackpot. it does not matter if you following more strict rules or your model explains something better, even the fact that you do not follow something most others do will make you an outcast.

if you look at the combined ""understanding"" in physics, things do neither add up, nor is it consistent or even likely. in fact, most of our theories are bullshit and only give some approximate solution at best. yet, people are so confinced of this believe system, it's absurd. (if you need to accept dozens of free chooseable variables that need to be well balanced for a model to work, it is a believe system).

the funny, sad and kind of typical human thing is: we already have the most powerful tool imaginable to save the planet. but even trying to get people to fucking spent time thinking about it, checking it or using it - nothing. it's like talking to morons that do not understand the problems we are facing and still think the world is flat...

this is the most frustrating experience of my life. on the other hand, I choose not to procreate and it solved the purpose of my life - I now know really why. so for me it's became a spectacular shitshow... sad and entertaining at the same time.","2018-03-21 20:04:49","2","poelzi","1747883746.564896","climate doom","manual"

The reality is that nobody has ever gotten out alive.

Recognizing reality, we must despair. Giving up is a form of accepting reality.

Once we give up, in a way, we have nothing to lose. A man with nothing to lose is a dangerous man. It is my position, that we must come to this place in order to make changes. It is unlikely that we can agree on the changes required; we should each do the best we can, as we understand the problem. Why not at least try? We have nothing to lose. 

I choose to focus on living a low impact lifestyle when I can. Live near work, use transit as much as possible, try to grow some of my own food. Still, I want to travel once in awhile, by car, to get out of the city to enjoy the wilderness. It's a compromise. There are no simple solutions.

It is better to come to an acceptance so we can move forward than live a life of despair.
