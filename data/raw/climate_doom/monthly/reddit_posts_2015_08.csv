"3fis8t","climate","scientific","How doomed are we?","I've taken a hard line approach recently in debates. I kind of sound like are an arsehole doing that. It's partly to break out of a particular mindset that demands keep a few things in my head at the same time. It's also to wake myself and others into the implications of what's being said by mainstream climate scientists.

The mainstream science points to probably 2 degrees of warming being expected now. As I understand it that will cause serious amounts of damage to societies around the world. The impact of that cannot be contained.

To prevent more serious damage we would need to have either the techno fix or political revolution to start now to prevent more serious warming.

If I say this I am accused of being a pessimist, an alarmist or excusing reckless behaviour.

The techno fix would be great if it was here, if it worked, if it was on the scale we need. I can't help but seeing it isn't there. I really applaud the effort. But well meaning action is not a solution. I don't think renewable power is there yet.

On top of that the general activist position is anti tech and pro politics. Though the desperate situation has forced people to change there mind and call for anything that might help. Many see tech as too late and the only answer is politics.

I am told that the political solution is here only if only people would choose it or knew about it. It ultimately sounds like asking people to give up their lifestyle in order to avoid giving up their lifestyle. ""Just sacrifice everything that you currently enjoy, to avoid losing it at some point in the future. Everyone will be so impressed they will emulate you.""

It's baffling because pretty much everyone who asks for the sacrifice is not walking the talk, and those are the believers. The demand for sacrifice always seems limited to luxury items, it never covers hospitals, basic agriculture, essential commuting, administration, law enforcement. It's always easy points about third holidays, new phones and second cars. Sacrifice means sacrificing jobs, medicine, healthcare, diets, pets, schools, family size, everyday goods.

How are the politics supposed to work internationally? Often the debate will be routed into issues of colonialism and historic exploitation as if somehow the debate is moral rather than scientific in origin. The rhetoric often says the rich countries should set a moral example. As if that is how international economic policy is worked out. No country is going to be morally shamed into not industrialising.

Most countries constantly try to boost growth anyway they can to avoid economic decline which they, democracy and dictatorship alike, know means instant political turmoil and collapse. Yet climate action demands economic decline. The win win days are gone.

The response to that is the environment demands it.

It begins to sound like a preacher trying to cure the sick or motivational speaker, ""failure is not an option."" The reality is failure is an option. Failure is more than expected.

It's a terrible thing to contemplate but I feel people are pulling their punches to avoid saying terrible things.

The older I get the more interested I am in how things will be than in how things ought to be.

I know this possibly sounds offensive. I now reddit is largely US based and the debate there is more about denial. I'm coming from a position of being in Europe and onside for 20 years.

Does anyone else think this?

How far off am I?

Does your solution sound realistic to yourself?

I guess I'm just in a similar position as the Dark Mountain people.

**tl;dr**

The science says we are most likely doomed.

"3fryc6","climate","scientific","Trying To Be Optimistic, Find The Will To Fight [x-post from /r/environment]","I've always been aware of climate change and have done little things here and there to do my part. The truth is, I didn't realize until this past week just how bad things were until I stumbled into a thread about it. Since then, I've been actively making lifestyle changes, but I cannot escape the feeling, especially after Obama's plan yesterday not hitting as hard as it should and the fear that the Paris talks are not going to really do enough, that we are completely doomed and hopeless.
Yet, many people that I've been reading keep going. I'm trying to find that light in the dark. Everywhere I look, it just seems like we've lost the fight already and are doomed. I haven't been able to even find a single shred of optimism regarding climate change. I just get hopeless thinking about even trying to fight for the cause and I'm now at the point that I have severe anxiety and depression from it.

I'm obsessed with thinking about it and cannot get it out of my head. I'm just absolutely terrified that the next generation is going to be totally screwed and that the end of my life will be awful. Given a lot of you are in the rough ballpark of my age group (I'm 27), I'm sure you can relate to this in some way.

I'd like to know - where do you find the will to keep fighting? How do you ward off the anxiety that comes with knowing that extinction is on the brink? What, if anything, is making you optimistic that we'll at least mitigate SOME damage?","2015-08-04 18:21:48","13","53","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3fryc6/trying_to_be_optimistic_find_the_will_to_fight/","True","skyturnsred","1747838427.422961","climate doom","manual"
