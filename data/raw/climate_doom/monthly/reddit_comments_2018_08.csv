The difference being a haphazard reader will only see the positive spin there and go on thinking ""someone will fix it"" rather than the worse case of incomplete reading here and where it could lead. So because of that, we should be held to a higher standard than the subs pretending there's solutions galore? Doesn't seem too fair. That there's a warning on the sidebar should be enough caution, as there's some people who are going to get depressed at any level of bad news.

The doomsday clock is 2 minutes to midnight and serious well credentialed climate scientists share this bleak outlook.

Isn't that also true of optimistic mainstream coverage of climate change?

In climate science, it's inevitable that some estimates and predictions will be based on false assumptions, bad interpretations of data, bad data itself, plain old mistakes, and biased extrapolation (towards hope or doom).

Until very recently the trend has been for mainstream media to report optimistic projections of climate change. It seems inevitable that in a place like /r/collapse that pessimistic views will be prevalent.

One reddit user critiquing another reddit users opinion isn't a good basis for a safe scientific method. People should read what they find here with a pinch of salt, just as they should read climate change denial and overly optimistic climate change reports with the same scepticism. The truth is ""nobody knows"". We are in an entirely new and incredibly complex situation. There is no right answer. On the other hand, yes, when opinions and projections are based on clearly inaccurate reasoning, they should be called out.

But the concept that everyone should stop being so pessimistic on /r/collapse because some unknown people might read it and become suicidal is also highly questionable reasoning. It's an emotive appeal to stop people questioning the current climate situation in critical ways, when it's quite clear that many climate scientists themselves suffer from depression and believe the situation is far worse than is reported to the general public.

BUT when most of the posting are links to tabloid type pieces you cannot guarantee the information is anything based in the realms of reality. And certainly the so-called mainstream media CANNOT be trusted as far as you can throw it, so you have to understand we now live in an age of unreliable information where things are cherry picked and mis-quoted on a daily basis. Too much inaccurate information is part of the course these days not just on reddit but even on your BBC news broadcasts as an example. 

Secondly, I disagree that this is causing people to wish to kill themselves. They are using this an excuse. If they are genuinely suicidal then they already were before reading crap on here. I am a former suicidal person, I have attempted to kill myself several times in the past and on more than one occasion almost succeeded and woke up in hospital with illness and injury as the result. But not from reading reddit. From life experiences. I could read anything on here and it is water off a duck's back. 

In Fact I would go as far to say as reading this sub daily now for about a year has helped to stabilize me and has removed my suicidal thoughts. It has grounded me and made me realise that no matter how bad my own life problems are other people have it worse and still fight on living. It no longer depresses me that the world is seriously messed up. I have come to peace and acceptance with it. I come here to read whats going on in the world, whats new, whats changed, is there any good news? what's gone wrong today etc..

My opinions and beliefs about collapse are fluid and change all the time based on new information, I have an open mind. I do not use this as an excuse to feel sorry for myself or feel depressed. Don't get me wrong I am a pessimist and not at all hopeful that humans are going fix climate change. 

But I feel like, how can I put it, like I am living in a very important time in human development. Maybe in the final time. I think maybe I will be alive to see humanity fall. I feel obligated to stay around and watch and witness it first hand. I understand I will die at some point, everyone will. But now rather than trying to bring my death about now, I want to live. I want to die when the planet says it is time. But I want to watch how this plays out. I know it kinda makes me sound like I want it to happen, I would jump for joy if a new miracle technology came along to solve this. But like I said I just can't see it happening. I like to make my own predictions every week based on what I learn here, and almost every time I am correct. 

I wouldn't change anything about this sub. I thin when you start to censor people and limit people that's when you turn your back on knowledge and you become ignorant and dumb. The world government is trying so desperately to kill freedom of ~~speech~~ everything. I don't believe we should help them to censor us. Might as well just shut reddit down all together then eh?

We all can imagine some scenario where suddenly something happens cataclysmic enough where we are set free to again roam an empty planet like a Stone Age nomad.

Also, we cant be responsible for anyones mental health but our own, especially when dealing with strangers over the internet. there is a warning in the sidebar, if people dont wanna read that and act accordingly, idk what anyone can do. The most important thing is to be honest with our opinions, dont be a dick, and look for reputable sources (although knowing what is reputable is extremely subjective).

No. But in a few years if the heat continues at this pace,  or gets worse and more occurring droughts you bet your ass civilization could abruptly halt and eventually fall apart.

I think you are also dead wrong about people speaking out on how dire the situation is, there are very powerful people and governments who would rather have the public sleep walk into the apocalypse than deal with chaos, riots and social unrest....not until the absolute last moment where’s its undeniable.

Also, the idea that this sub should censor itself out of concern for depressives is utterly ridiculous.

I want all the available information. **I will decide** what is accurate info and what's questionable. I do not need some self appointed protector of fragile snowflake feelings trying to control what info I get.

i have no problem with the religous folk thinking Jesus will return and burn all infidels i will tell they are wrong but truthfully  i don't really care.

there was one individual on here who thought the government  was creating the hurricanes (lol the power output of a cat 5 hurricane can regularly  be more than humanity puts out in electricity in a year) there really was no point with that individual  they definitely thought the government was deity like.

I have no problem with folk who like an elon musk think they know it all and believe all these problems can be fixed with technology. i will tell them they are wrong but i truly have no problem with it.

the only problem i have is when folk tell me Shiori katsuna is not an attractive woman , thats when im like get the fuck out, you vile, vile human you presence is not desired you are bringing negative energy to my chakra  be gone   vagabond, be gone!","2018-08-11 12:22:12","-7","robespierrem","1747888522.227586","climate doom","manual"
