Congratulations, you have found out the truth of why we will inevitably collapse. Even if we harnessed unlimited clean energy, the extractivist method of wealth generation would deplete most of our non-renewable resources sooner rather than later. If we manage to avoid that, and I enter the realm of lunacy here, by mining asteroids or something, then overpopulation would lead to calamity. If we leave this planet with this same ideology, then new colonies would last exponentially less than this earth before they are depleted as well.

1) Your story about working with fossil fuel companies reminded me of this recent quote: *""Partnering with Putin on a ""Cyber Security Unit"" is akin to partnering with Assad on a ""Chemical Weapons Unit"".* But when it comes to climate change, it's cool, right?

2) That's an interesting perspective on the death of creativity when it comes to solutions. I remember watching a documentary of Limits to Growth and one of the people on the team was like, ""We thought everybody would be super excited to solve this problem because at that time it was still possible to fix things."" 

I don't think people really put together how neo-liberalism and globalization hinder creativity and innovation. Many people believe that *innovation* (particularly private innovation) a la Silicon Valley will save us. But we are actually in an innovation crisis and R&D has been defunded and declining over the past decade. In America, we have probably never been *less innovative* than we are right now. [David Brooks' most recent column has at least part of the puzzle right.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/opinion/how-we-are-ruining-america.html) See Also [The Complacent Class](https://www.amazon.com/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American/dp/1250108691)

3) The last part of what you wrote made me think about the protesters right now who are pushing back against the health care repeal. Congresspeople are nervous. Townhalls are full. Arrests every day in DC and in home districts.

I think you make a good case that the public, the people, the masses are the only way this is going to change, in any way. It's not going to come from vested interests.

I am pretty die-hard apathetic when it comes to doing something about climate change. But your post made me feel the slightest flutter of feeling I've felt in a while. Climate change is the only issue that matters. At all. It trumps all other issues because it is truly existential.","2017-07-11 15:50:20","15","[deleted]","1747875802.254549","climate doom","manual"

A clean place to live. Their own habitat. They’re worried that someday in the future they might be personally inconvenienced. Narrow, unenlightened self-interest doesn’t impress me. Besides, there is nothing wrong with the planet, nothing wrong with the planet. The planet is fine. The people are fucked. Difference. Difference. The planet is fine. Compared to the people, the planet is doin’ great! It’s been here four and a half billion years. Did you ever think about the arithmetic? The planet has been here four and a half billion years. We’ve been here, what? A hundred thousand? Maybe two hundred thousand and we’ve only been engaged in heavy industry for a little over two hundred years. Two hundred years versus four and a half billion. And we have the conceit to think that somehow we’re a threat? That somehow we’re gonna put in jeopardy this beautiful little blue-green ball that’s just a floatin’ around the sun? The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through all kinds of things worse than us. Been through earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drift, solar flares, sunspots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles, hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids, and meteors, world-wide floods, tidal waves, world-wide fires, erosion, cosmic rays, recurring ice ages, and we think some plastic bags and some aluminum cans are going to make a difference?

The planet isn’t going anywhere. We are! We’re goin’ away. Pack your shit, Folks, we’re goin’ away. We won’t leave much of a trace either, thank god for that. Maybe a little styrofoam, maybe, little styrofoam. Planet’ll be here and we’ll be long gone. Just another failed mutation. Just another closed-end biological mistake, an evolutionary cul de sac. The planet will shake us off like a bad case of fleas, a surface nuisance. You wanna know how the planet’s doin’? Ask those people at Pompeii, who were frozen into position from volcanic ash. How the planet’s doin’. Wanna know if the planet’s alright, ask those people in Mexico City or Armenia, or a hundred other places buried under thousands of tons of earthquake rubble if they feel like a threat to the planet this week. How about those people in Kilauea, Hawaii who built their homes right next to an active volcano and then wonder why they have lava in the living room. The planet will be here for a long, long, long time after we’re gone and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself ’cuz that’s what it does. It’s a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed, and if it’s true that plastic is not degradable well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm: the earth plus plastic. The earth doesn’t share our prejudice towards plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason the earth allows us to be spawned from it in the first place: it wanted plastic for itself. Didn’t know how to make it, needed us. Could be the answer to our age-old philosophical question, “Why are we here?” “Plastic, assholes.”

"dk2ivww","t3_6mlvi2","6mlvi2","collapse","skeptical","Thanks for sharing, but I doubt more articles like the NY magazine one will have any meaningful impact. Even limits to growth generated quite a stir at the time only to die down quietly. 

The reason is that withing human society, the current human society swimming in energy abundance that is, strategies that dissipate energy quickly are evolutionarily favored, just because there´s not much energy left for others then. For example Europeans, with their energy harnesses like cattle or gun powder, steam rolled the natives pretty much everywhere. They had the power, natives didn´t.

As there is no external force to push powerdown on humans yet, Trump-like strategies prevail. I see it as very unlikely that humans would push powerdown on themselves voluntarily. The only way is then to wait for the inevitable collapse, as fatalistic as it sounds. If we´re lucky, societies might become more cooperative if anything is left of them at that stage.

>It became a known threat in the 1970s and, at the time, it didn't seem to be the terrible problem it has become today. ""Phase one"" involved proposals such as double-paned glass windows, low consumption light bulbs, smaller cars, and the like. **Much of the world's environmental movement still lives in phase one**: they think that it will be sufficient to explain to people what the problem is and to convince everyone to make some small sacrifices. Then, the problem will be solved.

I have an anecdotal story from a friend, she has a degree in Education a Masters in Law and said she knows climate chnage isn't a problem becasue our government is doing what's best for us, so for her and many like her it isn't a problem because it can't be.  Which is just of course just another argument against democracy :)

We are also seeing ""denial"" from the likes of Mann, Hansen etal who keep saying it won't be a problem becasue ""we have to fix it, we have no choice"".  While they are excellent in their field they are neither experts in energy nor in human behaviour. If you ask those folk, for example Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, they say there is no hope.  If you speak to experts in energy eg [Professor Kevin Anderson](https://youtu.be/-T22A7mvJoc), [Professor Susan Krumdeike](http://low-emission-future.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/can-engineers-change-world-energy.html) etal they say there is hope but only with a massive reduction in energy consumption and the complete reorganisation of the economic and political systems of the world... and while that is true, that's simply not going to happen.
