Do you want them to ""fight"" more? Tax the rich first.

I take issue with your idea that carbon wealth taxes should be redistributed to the poor. The poorer you are, the higher the percentage of your income that you consume.

At the end of it all, you cannot force the rich to do something if they aren't enforced to do so with, guess what, force.

This force comes from somewhere (certainly not you alone), and people that carry out said enforcement must be incentivised to do so. These incentives are usually salaries, rewards, or power over other people. The people who can afford to do this incentivising are, guess what, the rich and the popular. But mostly the rich.

Do you see the problem we are in? Every world government, no matter how simple or complicated, eventually boils down to this:

The rich rule with force they pay for and ensure future riches, and the poor do not. End of story.
