"arcasw","climatechange","action-oriented","Why I’m skeptical with climate change","Before everyone goes at me, no I’m not a climate change denier. I believe it is real and most of it is man made. However, some of the predictions on the news I find questionable. Such as the “12 years until we’re doomed” meme going around some climate alarmists. I believe that this is just the minimum time when we can stop warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we have a _little_ more time until things start to get chaotic. This is coming from a soon-to-be 15 year old, and I believe that some of the exaggerated claims and fear mongering in some climate news is incredibly damaging to the mental health of teens and adults. 

No, we’re not going to be cooking alive and the sidewalks start melting like we are on Venus in our lifetimes. Things WILL suck in the near future, but we can survive. It is not completely bleak, like alarmists say. Is it concerning? Absolutely. Will there be an apocalypse in the next couple decades? The world, as we know it, may severely change, and some may feel like it is the end. But it is debatable, and I believe we should attempt to work to help it, but also focus on our own lives. As being all doom and gloom about this can be severely unhealthy. This is what can lead to depression, anxiety, and suicide over this problem.","2019-02-16 19:48:53","8","31","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/arcasw/why_im_skeptical_with_climate_change/","True","Sylveon_Fan","1747894810.1567","climate doom","manual"
"amose7","climatechange","action-oriented","Nature is more intelligent than us humans. It will get rid of us sooner than you think","I was reading this Scientific American article and it reminded me on how we humans think we are intelligent when we are actually underestimating the greater universe, nature and all the things surrounding us. Nature is much more intelligent than what we hallucinate here.

As the [article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/hot-planet/climate-change-were-not-literally-doomed-but/) says, humans are crap on predicting the future. 

*Humans are terrible at thinking about probabilities, as every weather forecaster on the receiving end of abuse for being “wrong” well knows.*

That is because we are programmed by society to think linearly. But the universe works exponentially. What I mean is, we are probably going to experience extreme disaster much much earlier than we thought we would. I feel as if humans are predicting a dire situation for the next generation (like in this article), it will actually happen in the next few years. Maybe in the next decade, who knows?  Humans know shit about the future. When things like this happen, they accelerate exponentially and most humans fail miserably on seeing that coming. I'm not talking about human extinction but huge paradigm shift events like massive bushfires, colossal sequential hurricanes, massive draughts... you name it. Events that are enough to change humanity forever. Stuff like what WW2 was for mankind. That could be even related to how climate change will affect food supply, just like the a [famine and the volcanic eruption that changed mankind forever.](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/a-volcanic-eruption-with-global-repercussions-an-irishman-s-diary-on-1816-the-year-without-a-summer-1.2760797)

To me, nature has given a lot of warnings on what's going on, it is like the planet is having a fever because it's trying to fight us like antibodies fighting viruses in our own bodies. 

No I'm not pessimistic, I think this will end up being a good thing. Why? Because the faster we get violently slapped in the face by nature, the better. We are not quite there yet. But once we are humbled back to our primitive, maybe we will be able to think like the nature wants us to think again, and react exponentially. And therefore, save the planet because there will be no deniers left when **REAL** disaster hits.

"av06wf","climatechange","action-oriented","Looking for information and feedback"," Global warming/climate change:  
1) Is the climate changing more rapidly than we have observed in the past 150 or so years? Seems likely.  
2) Is it caused by human intervention in the environment? It is hard to just say, ""the science"" points to yes, especially knowing first-hand, that there is an extreme amount of bias and subjectivity in drawing conclusions in any scientific study. That is precisely why we do not depend indefinitely on a single source for any cutting edge result. Additionally, there is so much liberal bias in the scientific community, how can one distinguish what is subjective fact and a completely biased interpretation of results (especially when not being an expert yourself)? There is something extremely pretentious and presumptuous in a belief such as this.   
Having said that, could the deforestation and air pollutants created by industrialization of humans be a culprit or contributor? Certainly. Has literally any scientific study thoroughly assessed the possibility this is due to one of many, many astronomical perturbations of Earth's non-nominal rotation, oblateness, not-perfectly-elliptical and variably perturbed orbit, or effects of other celestial objects (ex. the Moon, Jupiter, potentially undiscovered objects in the LaGrange points of the Earth-Sun or Earth Moon systems, etc.)? Some mention astronomical effects very briefly (the most I have found is a single sentence that immediately rules this out as a possibility), but I have a very deep suspicion that they were not very thorough investigations. So as far as I have read, these things have not been addressed, and if you have anything to say otherwise, please share. My goal is to educate myself and make my own judgement call, not to blindly accept some biased researchers' opinion.  
3) Is this a bad thing? Will there be doom and gloom as a result? Many die from cold temperatures every year. As less do, the argument is that more will die from more extreme heat or other effects of climate change. Seems debatable. Nothing I have read has convinced me of deaths from heat alone being a major issue - especially in light of the drastic reduction in cold-related deaths. Will there be ""new normal"" extremes in weather patterns? We cannot even accurately predict the weather. What makes us believe these same models can somehow be more accurate over decades? Many studies are actively debating this exact thing and the jury is still out as far as I can tell. Is this sensationalism to get more research funding? Or sensationalism to get more votes/support from constituencies? Those seems much more likely than the former.  
4) Should the US be the primary entity held responsible for changing it? I strongly believe that it is quite naive and overstates our ability, let alone to even begin to understand how to positively influence a trend in such a complex system as the global environment. I mean, we cannot even predict the weather correctly (See any major snow/storm announcement in Northern Alabama in the last 6 years as an easy, albeit anecdotal example of this).   
Additionally, how can we rule out that this is not just a ploy for self-aggrandizement for the political left? When you have industrializing nations such as China and India with orders of magnitude greater populations pumping the largest amounts of pollution into the air, this seems unreasonable to put on the US's shoulders. I believe we have come quite a long way in the last 30 to 40 years and have a very acceptable amount of environmental protection in place. At some point, you get greatly diminished returns, especially when we are not even close to the primary polluters of the world.  
5) Is this a good thing? Since we will reduce the number of people dying from extreme cold, that certainly is not bad. Will an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to any other negative effects on the environment at large? The things that I have read here say things like, ""the increase in algae will cause a massive die-off of coral reefs and other sea life"". These are complex systems that DO NOT exist in isolation. When one creature or plant thrives, others sometimes take advantage of this. How do we know that animals that thrive on algae will not proportionally grow to accommodate the new source of sustenance? Can anyone say for certain that would not be the case? My limited biology background gives me the intuition that more carbon dioxide means more fuel for plant growth, which is a good thing, if we want more plants. With all of the deforestation humanity has brought about, wouldn't more lush and plentiful plant-life be a good swing in the right direction? Also, less cold globally means less need for man-made heat, i.e. reduced power needs and therefore less carbon emissions. That is also a good thing.   
Can anyone give me any other points on this or actual scientific research (not just articles written by biased journalists that think they are scientists, etc.)?","2019-02-26 14:44:18","1","10","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/av06wf/looking_for_information_and_feedback/","True","sekkou527","1747894852.4977028","climate doom","manual"
"ar64um","climatechange","action-oriented","How to deal with Climate Anxiety","Having lurked on this thread, and experienced many of the issues that other members have faced i.e. a sense of doom and gloom and helplessness ib this situation, I thought I would offer some advice on how to mentally deal with this scenario.

In an age where continual growth is the aim, where 'smashing our goals', and competing against everyone is all that matters, we've lost a sense of perspective. Life has become ubfeasible.

The truth is, you alone cannot solve the world's problems. Most of us can't even solve the problems of people closest to us, let alone the lives of strangers thousands of miles away. So, let's focus on what we can control. This is where stoic philosophy comes into play.

The stoics believed that there are only two things you can control; everything else is secondary. They are:

1. Your thoughts
2. Your actions

You cannot control how hot the world is going to get. You cannot control the decline of biodiversity. You cannot stop fossil fuels burning. 

What you CAN control, is your behaviour which can ultimately affect the world in a positive way.

Your job, every single day, is to simply focus on being the best citizen you can be. Being environmentally aware. Being positive. Whether you influence those around you or not, is out of your control. So don't worry about it. 

Remember this, and you will feel better about yourself, will worry less about how others will perceive you, and without realising, your actions will have impact.","2019-02-16 06:21:39","33","5","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ar64um/how_to_deal_with_climate_anxiety/","True","TrepurYarrum","1747894856.9894872","climate doom","manual"
"amttvf","environment","emotional","The True Terror of Climate Change: Part 1","Intro:

&#x200B;

This isn’t something I take some sort of arrogant self-satisfaction in writing. In truth it is the most depressing thing I’ve ever typed out in my drawn-out youth of half-baked high-school poetry and pandering college essays. I’m writing this because I’m frustrated. I’m frustrated by a combination of two traditional narratives I often see in regards to discussing the impending ecological collapse we typically refer to as ""climate change"". The first is that there is hope to maintain the current state of things, always of the “just enough time to act” variety, and the follow-up assumption that seems to come with that is that communicating any sense of impending “doom” or “hopelessness” will dissuade people from trying to mitigate the disaster. Articles such as the following convey this attitude (and I hope to respond directly to this article soon) - [http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/](http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/)

Personally I don’t buy into either of these narratives. The following writing, however short or long it becomes, will seek to address these narratives while simultaneously revealing a more concrete truth buried within them both. 

&#x200B;

Part 1: The Problem: 

&#x200B;

Before we go into things like the politics or response efforts to climate change (and the wider issues of ecological collapse), let’s take some time to just examine the problem itself. In this section, we will look solely at the challenges facing the global atmosphere, how that ties into the biosphere, and the nature of the problems confronting both the natural world and wider human society. 

For most people, the entry point for understanding the environmental problems as a cohesive global issue comes from being introduced to climate change. The basic premise introduced is simple: humans are emitting CO2 in the form of fossil fuel consumption, that emission of CO2 is changing (warming) the climate, and that given a long enough scale, this problem will fundamentally reshape things like coastal communities or the ability to maintain agriculture.

Many see this as the end of the journey in understanding climate change. It present a clear issue, gives it a name, describes it in an elevator-speech type format, and provides a paradoxically simple yet complex solution to solving it: Humanity must emit less CO2 over time to avoid changing the climate too radically in order to maintain the status quo of the industrialized modern world. 

Unfortunately, this narrative is intensely limited. For example, it doesn’t touch on the idea that humanity emits a multitude of gasses into the atmosphere, many of which trap far more heat than CO2.

The factory farm system has added millions of bovine to the surface of the Earth that simply didn’t exist before, and the nature of decomposing societal waste in the form of landfills is also a modern creation of the past century. Both of these processes emit an enormous amount of Methane. This is important to note because Methane actually traps 100 times as much gas as CO2 in its first year of introduction, and retains roughly 72 times the amount of heat after 5 years. There is something to be said for the fact the Methane tends to dissipate from the atmosphere after 10 years, but its ability to accumulate over that time and our continued increase of its production has largely outpaced this dissipation. - [http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/) 

(how factory farming adds to climate change.) - [https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html](https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html)

Yet even with this understanding the severity of something as simple as 1 additional chemical is downplayed. Since methane tends to be seen as more of a “burst” of heating as opposed to the “sustained” heating CO2 leads to, there is an instinct to see it as less of a threat, or at least as less of an enduring one. What this ignores however is the nature of how this type of short-term burst of heating adds to the wider cycle of climate change. 

As Methane adds to the heating cycle, it gives a boost to the melting of arctic and sub-arctic permafrost in the regions of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Russia’s Siberia. This permafrost itself contains an unknowable amount of gasses, all trapped within the once permanently frozen areas of those regions. As these areas are thawed for the first time in 1000’s of years, they release the CO2 and methane stored beneath, thus accelerating the warming cycle in a way that is outside of human influence or control. The problem is pervasive enough that scientists continue to show larger-than-expected amounts of these gasses being released into the atmosphere from this process. - [https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html)

This process gives us an introduction to the wider problem of climate change, which is the nature of its intersectionality with the wider crises facing the World’s ecosystems. Still, taken in this view the common perspective often looks to the atmosphere itself as the source of both the problem and the solution. A deeper look shows how other environmental problems tie into this process. 

Let’s take de-forestation as an example. It is no surprise to anyone who passed 3rd grade science that plants take in CO2 emitted by humans and other animals, and that they in-turn release oxygen for our consumption. This understanding leads us to a natural conclusion: the more trees we have on the planet, the better we’ll be able to regulate the escalation of gasses like CO2 and Methane. Indeed, scientists have said for a long time that the global forest systems are the best means for mitigating climate change. - [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/)

Unfortunately, looking into the rate of deforestation itself will show that we are only adding to the problem by clearing these necessary ecosystems, rather than helping to mitigate the disaster by protecting them. The amazon rainforest is perhaps the best example. Often referred to as “the world’s lungs”, it is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the planet, and is responsible for 20% of all the oxygen inhaled by every living creature on the planet. 

Despite the overwhelming importance of this region, its destruction has gone largely unchecked, ironically pushed to exploit resources that add heat to the atmosphere or for the clearing of land for industrial farming. The fact that Brazil recently elected Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier (liar) who has promised to increase rainforest “development” and shifted control of the region from the country’s environmental agency to its agricultural one, shows that this problem has little chance of slowing. - [http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/](http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/)

(Bolsonaro transfers power over the rainforest to agricultural ministry.) - [https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land](https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land)

One could be forgiven for hoping that forest protection efforts or re-forestation efforts might help make up some of this difference. Depressingly though, this is not the case. The largest bio-spheres of the planet with the largest areas of forest cover have experienced massive forest lost since 2001 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, lost 12 million hectares of forest cover in that 16 year period, with their single highest year of loss being 2017 itself at 1,470,000 hectares in a single year. For perspective, the total area of Michigan is 25,049,329 hectares. This means that the Democratic Republic of Congo alone has cleared an area of forest almost half the size of the entire state of Michigan in less time than it takes a human being to go from infancy to high-school graduation. Taken in conjunction with forest loss in other countries, the situation’s urgency begins to reveal itself. - [https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map) 

Still, not even this combination of factors is able to show the true all-encompassing nature of the environmental catastrophe we now find ourselves living through. To gain a wider picture of the problem, we should look beyond our own visible atmosphere and turn to the other 2/3rds of our planet: The Oceans. 

The World’s oceans absorb 35 - 42% of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, and over 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming. Their importance in mitigating and understanding climate change, and the nature of change that the warming climate will have on these ecosystems, cannot be understated. - [https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/)

This absorption has already begun to affect the oceans, despite the system taking about 20 - 40 years to fully react to the change. This delayed reaction means that, even if humans were to discontinue all CO2 emission today, the oceans would continue to change as a result of global warming for decades beyond that end. This is known as “The thermal intertia of the oceans.” - [https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html](https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html)

The nature of the change which has already taken place has been massively negative. Coral reefs have begun bleaching far more often than in previous decades. While bleaching events are a natural process, their increased rate means the reefs don’t have time to recover as part of the natural cycle, leading to massive die-offs of these “underwater forests” from regions such as the Great Barrier Reef. Naturally, this destruction removes sources of food for important parts of the marine ecosystem and adds to the global ecosystem’s inability to effectively react to industrial human activity. - [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/)

While the death of massive amounts of marine life is obviously catastrophic for both the planet and our dependence on the Oceans, it’s not even the only story tied into the Oceans when it comes to climate change. Another effect is seen when we look at ocean currents, which are slowing and causing changes to weather patterns already. Indeed, global climate scientists have begun to ask whether the entire Ocean current system could “stall.” Since these currents help to power and carry everything from necessary rain patterns to hurricanes and cyclones, a change in these systems would have massive effects on human life. In fact, when hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, the national weather service had to add a new color to their radar mapping system simply so they could accurately track the amount of water being dumped on the State. They had never needed to measure rain in that amount in that region in the modern history of weather analysis. - [https://e360.yale.edu/features/will\_climate\_change\_jam\_the\_global\_ocean\_conveyor\_belt](https://e360.yale.edu/features/will_climate_change_jam_the_global_ocean_conveyor_belt)

Hurricane Harvey color added: - [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains)

Taken in conjunction with these problems, let’s finish by looking at how climate change can affect global weather patterns. While the hurricane example above is a good example to show how the change in the oceans from climate change helps propel a change in the weather, even this link is not a full view of the intersectionality which climate change represents. 

Perhaps the greatest immediate threat some developing countries will experience as climate change progresses isn’t the flooding of coastal cities, but rather the restriction or even complete eradication of water sources and localized water cycles. Many nations hosting millions of people rely heavily on localized water cycles for their populations. Pakistan, for example, requires snowfall in its northern region during the winter months in order to maintain its water usage, since the melting of this snow in those same mountain regions leads to massive water runoff which itself adds to and becomes the country’s rivers. - [http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/](http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/) 

This means that, should those regions warm to a point where that snowfall is extremely hindered or halted all together (as is widely predicted), the country would be left with an unknowable loss in water supply for its population of millions. Add to this the prediction that overall rainfall throughout the country is expected to decrease simultaneously with this loss of the glacial melting cycle, and you begin to paint a painfully dire portrait. - [https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change](https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change)

More on Pakistan: - [https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/](https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/)

This combination of diminishing rainfall and glacial runoff isn’t unique to Pakistan. India, the world’s most populous nation, is expected to feel many of the same effects. Additionally, the major rivers leading into China and Southeast Asia are largely sourced from Tibet and the Himalayas, an area of incredibly high mountains and sprawling natural glaciers. The Mekong river, the Yangtze, and many others find their source in this central region of the Asian continent. Yet the fate of those rivers and their water sources are cast into doubt as climate change hammers away at Tibet and drains the region of this naturally recurring and utterly necessary cycle. - [https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html](https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html) 

So where does that leave us? Well, hopefully this shows the impending nature of the climate catastrophe. Climate Change is not some vague idea or one that has limited effects, it is both propelled by and propelling countless other changes within systems that are vital to both human and ecological survival. Failing to understand the grand nature of this problem, its immediacy, and it intersectional elements has allowed cognitive dissonance around the issue to flourish. In order to move forward with even the most basic amount of optimism, we must confront the reality of what is happening, rather than seeking to downplay it in order to attract wider attention to the issue.

This urgency should be the engine to gain that wider attention.

Australia is flooding on one side and facing forest fires on the other. Changing to clean renewable energy is cheaper than ever before.  


We don't have 20 years, we don't have 10 years, we don't even have 5 years. We need to start demanding a change in how we get our energy now. We have only two choices, Keep making jokes about how something that is happening right in front of us is not happening, or we start demanding change at a local then state then federal level. This isn't about me, it isn't about you. It is about every single person on this planet. If we do nothing we will all die. Kids born today, won't be able to have kids or grandkids as we will be leaving an unfixable dying planet. We already lost 1/2 of every species in the world. We need to try and prevent any more. Please, this is not a scare tactic it is the truth. You do nothing and the world will end
