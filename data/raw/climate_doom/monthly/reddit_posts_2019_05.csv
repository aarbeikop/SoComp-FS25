"bjavvf","climatechange","action-oriented","A debate on climate change","I had a discussion at work with a co worker today about climate change... it didn’t go well... my style of debating climate change is first o state the cause and the change of CO2 over the years(the  General hypothesis). To rationalize the hypothesis like everybody seems to do, we have a cause in rising CO2, and the effect is an increase in extreme weather events, ocean acidification, forest fires and droughts... etc... the usual doom and gloom.... he then went on a I would say literal 21mins argument against the IPCC report and all the scientific wrong problems that he has found in the reports... I ended the debate with a you can believe and do what you wish as will I, but the fact is CO2 concentration is rising and we are getting environmental events that we can’t explain because of this... am I wrong? Or does his argument about the IPCC report scientifically mistake/problems carry weight?","2019-05-01 00:27:12","2","4","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bjavvf/a_debate_on_climate_change/","True","pyette91","1747898884.080333","climate doom","manual"

Seriously...what the fuck is going on?","We are on a path of civilization suicide. Turns out the worst-case predictions regarding the effects of global warming are the most likely to be true,

And yet F.F. production/consumption is now at an all time high...ALL TIME high!

We are literally careening into a brick wall and our response to this is to step on the gas. Wildfires floods disease droughts lack of drinking water wars mass migration food production collapsing fisheries collapsing famine riots violence society coming apart at the seems...its whats coming. 100% that is where we are headed 

Why...? 

Why do we do nothing? Why do we just sit here and say ""oh well fuck it at least snapchat has a new feature and Taco Bell has a new chupalapcrapdoodoo on the menu"" 

I mean Trump is dumb, sure. But the CEO's of dozens of the most influential corporations on earth are NOT dumb, no way. Maybe not nice people, but not dumb. They FULLY WELL know where we are headed and yet they intentionally make things worse. 

Why? They don't care about their own future or the future of their children? Really? Like at all...? They look at their own children and think ""Fuck that kid I will ruin the planet in my quest for money, I don't give a fucking shit how it effects my own offspring. He can die in a fire for all I care"" 


Like is that whats happening? Is the world run by Psychopaths and insane people? 

and some say ""well they have stocked and protected bunkers they can retreat to so they don't care""

well what the FUCK kind of life is that? Hunkered down is some shit bunker doing nothing all day? Thats a future to look forward to? 


How are we fully informed about our impending doom and still do nothing? 

The Green  new deal is pathetic. Its sparse on details and will never get passed. It wont because the most powerful people on the planet are determined we destroy it.

Moving around and away from the grief that may otherwise overpower a person's life is succeeds only when the grief stricken one comes to accept the facts of the situation.
