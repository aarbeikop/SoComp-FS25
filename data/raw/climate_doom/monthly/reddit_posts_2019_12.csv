>Good evening, Dr. Hayhoe!

>I created the subreddit /r/climatechange a decade ago and have observed something rather unusual over that time. Advocates such as yourself seem to be undercut at every turn by those who you would think would be your allies, especially when it comes to solutions.

>The most obvious example would be nuclear power. James Hansen, Kerry Emanuel, Tom Wigley, and Ken Caldeira famously wrote an op-ed in favor of nuclear power, but it hasn't seemed to have moved the needle among those who call themselves environmentalists. Even papers such as Clack, et al 2017 that roundly debunked the idea that solar, wind and hydro alone are sufficient to replace fossil fuels (in this case in response to a paper by Mark Jacobson) have done little good.

>How do you deal with ""own goals"" like these? What would you like the climate-concerned to change in their messaging?

Here is her answer, which I thought was remarkalbe:

>I completely agree; I have seen this trend emerge on twitter also in the last year and I absolutely hate it. People who turn their pet solutions into a religion and prosecute everyone else as heretics with the zeal of the Spanish Inquisition if they don't worship at the same shrine.

>It is all fear-based, though, and I do sympathise with that. So I would ask them to stop letting their fear control them and lead them into purity tests, small tents, circling wagons, shooting allies, chewing off our own legs, and doomerism. Their own fear is what may doom us in the end. I would try to engage with positive, inclusive actions and solutions with those who are willing, and ignore those who are not.

So, if you are a doomer, stop it.","2019-12-05 14:44:33","15","31","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e6i471/dr_hayhoe_on_being_undercut_by_allies/","True","Will_Power","1747905619.51341","climate doom","manual"
"ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Ideas to be more environmentally friendly","I've always considered myself to be eco conscious but I am currently reading 'The Uninhabitable Earth' and its spurred me to make bigger life changes for 2020 🙌 Next year I want to do MORE to reduce my impact on the Earth 🌍 I already do the following...

• I recycle and compost

• I travel by public transport (I don't have a car)

• I always bring my own bags to the supermarket 

• I donate to green initiatives

• I vote for political parties that consider the climate emergency

• I use eco friendly, fragrance free washing up liquid and laundry detergent 

• I visit a zero waste shop to refill the above products

• I use reusable make up removal pads, sanitary wear, bamboo toothbrush etc 

• I am a strict vegetarian 

• I go litter picking 

• I pay to offset my carbon emissions each time I fly (not a frequent flyer)

• I avoid palm oil

• I frequently buy second hand clothing (90% of my wardrobe is eBay/depop)

• I am savvy with my water and energy usage within my home 

• I (gently) educate my family on environmental issues, as they are less clued up on Earth's impending doom!
