"esl6p5p","t3_c87ri2","c87ri2","environment","emotional","I thank my mother for bringing me up to think for myself.   


But I hate my mother for being so selfishly herself, as if she is more important than all of the people to come after her. 

&#x200B;

I am excavating a back garden from the concrete she put down, for the convenience, it sickens me that this wasted space has been there for so long.   


The fags, that I accepted long ago are killing her and am surprised that she has lasted this long, have produced a high pile of useless rubbish. The addiction is more important though.

  
The presents are nice. I do not want clothes that have already polluted the earth, because of their production, and going to continue to pollute because they are made with plastic. I do not need them.  I do not want the plastic toy that was mass produced in a factory and shipped half way across the earth to be of no use, what so ever! I do not need it! I do not need non reusable hand warmers, I don't use reusable hand warmers. I don't need a lot.  


The outlook of ""treat yoself"" has probably meant that she was more detrimental to my future than my mostly absent, alcoholic, abusive father ever could have been. He has planted a garden. Bought local. Forgotten to buy presents. raised animals. walked/cycled around. kept fit(ish), so the calls to the doctors and medical necessities were not frequent as hers. Thanks to her I am here and still alive.   


Thanks to knowledge I can try to make a better life for, hopefully, my children.","2019-07-02 15:10:04","1","Laugh_At_My_Name_","1747755296.62373","climate-friendly diet","manual"

The UK government were already discussing Climate Change in 1998, after the Easter Floods

[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1998/oct/20/easter-floods](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1998/oct/20/easter-floods)

*Does the Minister agree that,* ***although, as the review acknowledges, the conditions at Easter were exceptional, the prospect of climate change means that such exceptional conditions may become more frequent?*** *Surely  that not only reinforces the need for the reconsideration of flood preparations that the Minister has put in hand, but makes even more  urgent* ***the need for the Government to publish their own, long overdue, climate change strategy***\*.\*

Here's the Clinton Administration's take on it in Sep 2000

*President Clinton's chief adviser on climate change* ***says the strength of the scientific argument that global warming is happening is ""absolute""****.*

Between Oct-Nov 2000, most of W. Europe got hit by some of the largest river floods ever recorded [http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/\~mike/extremes/](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~mike/extremes/)

*""The Autumn (Fall) season of 2000 saw record rainfall and widespread  flooding in western Europe. It was* ***the wettest Autumn in England and Wales since records began in 1766***\*, and\* ***several regions from France to Norway received double their average rainfall.****""*

Alarm bells have been ringing loudly for some time, the response has been for people to stick their earplugs in and blindfolds on.

The Baby Boomers were the first generation to made aware of this from the late 1960's onwards, they chose to do nothing apart from drink more oil and eat more coal, at the same time, they will be the one's keeling over in the extra hot summers over the next decade.","2019-07-02 17:30:56","1","[deleted]","1747755296.6256151","climate-friendly diet","manual"
