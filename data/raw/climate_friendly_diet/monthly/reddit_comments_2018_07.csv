Through most of industrial history, the combustion of fossil fuels has had a very tight relationship with economic growth. You could say that because of the exceptional energy density of fossil fuels, one of the byproducts of burning one unit of fuel (along with emitting one unit of CO2) is a one-unit reduction in global poverty.

One of the tasks included in climate remediation is uncoupling this fairly tight relationship between fossil-fuels/CO2-emissions and economic growth. 

And it's happening now. I'm not aware of any rigorous studies on this question, but if they don't exist now then eventually they will. Currently I believe it's possible to sustain small sections of an average economy on a minimum-CO2-emissions basis. Consider a small upcountry agricultural town in a middle-income country like Malaysia, where there's basically no demand for heavy machines or air travel: You might be able to meet everyone's energy needs with renewable energy and electric vehicles. 

As technology improves, these low-emissions regions of the world economy will get larger. And presumably richer as well, since the demand for economic growth probably won't lessen in our lifetimes. 

But it's going to take several decades to break this link substantially. It's a gigantic task, and technology has many milestones to pass before the energy density of fossil fuels — which is so crucial for heavy machines and industrial applications — can be replicated with low-emissions methods. 

In the meantime, global poverty reduction and economic growth are still going to be largely driven by CO2-emitting processes. It's definitely a cost worth accepting, if you consider poverty reduction and wealth production to be indispensable parts of a morally acceptable future. But the costs of CO2 reduction will have to be paid sometime — most of them probably when technology enables CO2 reduction without undermining efforts at poverty reduction and economic growth. 

It will happen. It's just going to take a long time, and possibly even today's students won't see the arc completed in their lifetimes. This is basically another Industrial Revolution, and it's reasonable to think it will require at least a full human lifetime to complete.","2018-07-23 15:56:58","2","DocHarford","1747753724.6446369","climate-friendly diet","manual"

The future of humanity is not at stake. As to the rest it is survival of the fittest, exactly how nature intended. I refuse to believe in the 6th mass extinction until someone can produce a list.

How fast do you think the sea is rising? Someone would need to be very patient to be killed by sea level rise. ","2018-07-24 04:25:22","1","rogerramjet1975","1747753724.646375","climate-friendly diet","manual"
