**Heat Death** \- In 2003, a heat wave killed around 35,000 people in Europe, around 2,000 people died per day. After 4 degrees of warming those kinds of death-inducing temperatures will be a normal summer rather than a heat wave. At 5 degrees large parts of the world will become literally uninhabitable to humans and at 6 degrees working in the summer would be pretty much impossible for much of the US, with New York City being hotter than present-day Bahrain and the temperatures in places like Bahrain would be inhospitable. After 7 degrees of warming, temperatures around the equator would cook you to death in a matter of hours. If we ever reach 11 degrees then half of the world's population would die from heat alone. We will still have heatwaves alongside these hotter summers but they will be far hotter and therefore far deadlier as we are already seeing in instances like the 2010 heat wave in Russia which killed 55,000 people, 700 people per day died in Moscow alone.

**Hunger** \- For cereal crops, every 1 degree of warming leads to a 10% decrease in yields, meaning that if we experience a 5 degree warming by 2100 we may have 50% less grain to feed a 50% larger global population (grain currently makes up 40% of the human diet). This would also reduce the amount of meat we can produce since it takes 8 pounds of grain to produce a pound of hamburger meat. As well as the increases in heat, the increasing prevalence of droughts should also be considered. At just 2 degrees of warming, the Mediterranean and much of India will experience frequent droughts, straining global food supply. At 2.5 degrees, thanks mostly to drought, the world could enter a global food deficit needing more calories than the planet can produce. At 3 degrees, there would be further drought in Central America, Pakistan, the western United States, and Australia. And:

>By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American Dust Bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China. None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, would be reliable sources going forward.

**Drowning** \- On our current course we can expect between 4 and 8 feet of sea level rise by 2100. Or, if we keep to 2 degree of warming (unlikely) we could still conceivably reach a 6 feet rise. These rises would force hundreds of millions of people out of their homes as coastal cities all over the world are submerged.

**Wildfires** \- We are already seeing wildfires worsen - those in the US burn twice as much land as they did in 1970 (this could double again by 2050, and quadruple with every further degree of warming) and the wildfire season has grown by two and a half months. Recent examples include the 2018 Woolsey Fire, which caused 170,000 people to be evacuated, and the even worse Camp Fire which burned a whole town so quickly that the 50,000 evacuees ""found themselves sprinting past exploding cars, their sneakers melting to the asphalt as they ran"". Another fire in Colorado produced ""a volcano-like 300-foot eruption of flames"" now known as a ""fire tsunami"". Things are worsening outside of the US too. In 2017, fires in Greenland burned 10 times more than previously, and in 2018 fires broke out in Sweden, Finland, and Russia - the smoke from the Siberian fires reaching all the way to the US. The fires in Greece in 2018 killed 99 and ""At one resort, dozens of guests tried to escape the flames by descending a narrow stone staircase into the Aegean, only to be engulfed along the way, dying literally in each other’s arms"" whilst others burnt alive after becoming [trapped in their cars](https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/7/25/8a96b0d8c09b4ff98a757e33462cea03_8.jpg).

**Natural Disasters** \- 2017 saw the ""once in 500,000 years"" rainfall of hurricane Harvey drop a million gallons of water for every person in Texas on Houston, Hurricane Maria which killed at least 3,000 and ruined the lives of many more, the flood in South Asia that forced 45 million people from their homes, and the already mentioned wildfires. 2018 got even worse with a record-breaking global heatwave, 6 hurricanes and tropical storms appearing all at once - including Typhoon Mangkhut that killed 100 and Hurricane Florence that killed 50 and doubled the average annual rainfall in California. After 4 degrees of warming, these natural disasters will just be ""weather"", we will have to invent new categories to describe hurricanes, the ability for warmer air to hold more moisture will result in ""rain bombs"" like the one that hit Hawaii in 2018 with 50 inches of rain in 24 hours, tornadoes will leave longer and wider trails of destruction, hail rocks will quadruple in size. We are already experiencing 40% more intense rainstorms than in the 1950s, in some areas its as high as 71%.

**Water** \- Already, as many as 2.1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water, and 4.5 billion do not have access to safely managed water for sanitation. Half of the world's population are also reliant on the seasonal melt of glaciers for their water supply. At 2 degrees of warming the Himalayas will lose 40% of their ice by 2100 resulting in widespread water shortages, similar outcomes are expected in places like Peru and California that also rely on Glaciers. At 4 degrees the Alps will lose 70% of their snow by 2100. On our current course, by 2020 250 million more Africans could face water shortages, by 2050 that number could be 1 billion in Asia alone and freshwater supplies for cities all over the world could decline by two thirds. The increasing temperatures could also make the remaining drinking water unsafe by becoming breeding grounds for warm-water-friendly bacteria. This happened in 2007 with Lake Tai on which 2 million people were dependant. Likewise, the heating of Lake Tanganyika in East Africa devastated the fishing stocks eaten by millions of people.

**Unbreathable Air** \- Already 10,000 people die EVERY DAY from air pollution. The Air Quality Index categories the risks of air pollution on a numerical scale, the index tops out at the 301–500 range, warning of “serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly” and “serious risk of respiratory effects in the general population”; at that level, “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” In 2013, the Chinese ""airpocalypse"" reached 993 in the index and pollution killed 1.37 million people in China that year. In California in 2017, wildfires caused air pollution to reach 486 on the index, whilst in Delhi its at an index of 999 and breathing the air is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes each day. By 2090 2 billion people will be breathing air classed as unsafe.

**Plague** \- There are diseases trapped inside arctic ice that have not circulated in the air for for thousands or millions of years, as this ice melts these diseases may be reanimated. This has already happened several times: ""a 32,000-year-old “extremophile” bacteria revived in 2005, an 8-million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007, a 3.5-million-year-old one a Russian scientist self-injected, out of curiosity, just to see what would happen."" (Lol). Researchers have also discovered remnants of Spanish Flu (infected 500 million and killed 50 million in 1918) and suspect there may be remnants of smallpox, bubonic plague, and other diseases - many of which our immune systems will have no idea how to fight. As the planet warms we will also likely see the spread of diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, and zika to new places since insects like mosquitoes will be able to inhabit more and more areas.

**Bacteria -** I think this outcome of global warming is by far the most horrifying. Inside each of us there are bacteria of which about 99% is unkown to science, some of this bacteria we are reliant upon to survive, others may be completely benign. However, as temperatures rise, there is the possibility that the bacteria may be rewired, diminished or killed off entirely. Not only could this mean that those little bois inside us we rely on to survive are killed off or mutate and behave differently, but it also means that the other bacteria just chilling in there mutates into something new with fatal outcomes. This isn't just something that could happen in theory, it has already happened in some other species. The Saiga ([a kind of antelope that looks like a moose fucked a goat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Saiga_antelope_at_the_Stepnoi_Sanctuary.jpg)) had a bacteria living in its tonsils that posed no danger to it in any way. Then, during a heatwave in May 2015, the bacteria mutated and emigrated to the Saiga's bloodstream and then to its liver, kidneys, and spleen. This resulted in a 100% fatality rate, 120,000 dead Saigas, and the Saiga becoming extinct in some countries. Its entirely possible that humans may experience a similar thing.

**Economic Collapse** \- On our current path, it is estimated that 100 million people will be dragged into extreme poverty over the next decade alone. Not to mention the impacts the stuff mentioned above will have. (Unless you listen to Stevie Pinker, obviously).

**Climate Conflict** \- Each half-degree of warming increases the likelihood of armed conflict by 10-20% - that's 80-160% more war if we reach 4 degrees of warming and 40-80% more even if we stick to the 2 degrees of the Paris agreement. In Africa alone rising temperatures are expected to lead to \~400,000 more combat deaths by just 2030.
