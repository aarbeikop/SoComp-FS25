A letter to my parents (and many other parents of millennial children)

Throughout the world, the alarm bells that have been ringing for well over a decade now are finally starting to be heard. Freak weather events, record breaking heatwaves and highest temperatures year after year, distinct absences of frosty mornings in the winter, periods of drought and then weeks of heavy rain. Angry young people are telling politicians to sit down, shut up and listen, taking to the street with placards essentially begging for a shot at their future, before its robbed from us and generations to come. 

I don’t know how to persuade the complacent older generation who convivially laugh about how they’ll be dead before it’s a real problem for them - but Mum, Dad, I won’t be. I will be very much alive and so will (god willing) your grandchildren. You raised me to be successful, the scientist that I am. I have had the benefit of higher education that you have not so perhaps I have had the (mis)fortune of having these issues thrust in my face to analyse, to critique, to evidence and find solutions for. I can assure you now that you will not be dead before it’s an issue, because it’s an issue now. At the predicted pinnacle of all this climate chaos, in 2100, your grandchildren will be alive and fighting to stay cool, fighting for clean drinking water and adequate food, fighting for space and resources with millions of climate refugees who will be leaving equatorial areas in the next few decades. I do not want to hear that it is not your problem any more, because I am your daughter and it is my problem, and therefore yours.

Do you know that I am considering not having children at all? Since my late teens I dreamed of having a family, having children and raising them to be good and kind. But raising my children right may be the least of my concerns if I must arm them with the skills and wherewithal to cope with a planet that is slowly dying. You can have them during school holidays and feed them ice cream and take them to nice places, but when you hand them back to me, I must ensure that their future is secure for them seeing as ‘you’ll be dead’, so who cares. I must ensure that when I die, they are savvy enough to cope, they are tenacious enough to fight for resources. What if I must raise my children to live selfishly to ensure their survival? What if I everything I endeavour to preach, to be kind, to be generous, I have to double back on and preach instead to be cut-throat and vicious? I am not sure I can truly justify bringing new lives into this planet to condemn them to a life of suffering and fighting.

You may think me over dramatic but remember how proud you were when I graduated with my first degree and then my Masters. I have armed myself with analytical skills, I have privileged access to reams of scientific evidence that supports that modern climate change is perpetuated by human activity. Despite there being accessible evidence for the general public freely available, I know you won’t look for it or read it or take it seriously. But believe *me*. Trust *me*. Trust that I am not making this up, I am not being over-dramatic. Believe that I am scared and that you should be too. For my sake and the sake of your grandchildren. 

I would imagine from my (fortunately) limited understanding that coming to realise what trouble the planet is really in is like being diagnosed with cancer. Sat across from a professional who knows better than you, who is trained in these things and highly qualified, telling you that, potentially, you’re absolutely fucked. But. If you start treatment and you start it NOW, there is a chance that you can kick its ass after a bit of time, though you won’t be the same after. Your family won’t be the same. You will go forward in life from now on carefully considering your diet, your level of activity, the products you put on your body and clean your home with. I can imagine that it’s a shock to the system, to look at your life and realise the magnitude of change you must undertake. Knowing that it isn’t just down to you, it’s down to everyone. Your colleagues, your neighbours, your family, your friends, the server who brought you your food, the men who collect your rubbish, the newsreaders on the TV, that comedian you laugh at. What are they doing? What’s the point if they’re not doing a thing either? They’re ignoring this cancer - surely it’ll go away if we just change to energy-saving light bulbs and make sure the tap isn’t running while we brush our teeth... 

I guarantee you if you start making a change tomorrow, someone will see that and think – shit. If you’re doing something, maybe I should too. Maybe this is serious. After all, your daughter is a scientist, she’d know. And Mum, Dad, you should know. This isn’t a secret. This isn’t new. This is real. You might both be sun worshippers and be enjoying this ‘global warming lark’, but it isn’t to be laughed at. It is time to sit down, shut up and listen.","2019-07-02 10:47:08","13","6","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/c87ri2/a_letter_to_my_parents/","True","concerned_overlywarm","1747755295.04946","climate-friendly diet","manual"
