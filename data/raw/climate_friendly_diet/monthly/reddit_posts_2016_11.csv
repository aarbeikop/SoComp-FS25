"5c7kjj","environment","emotional","Are there any 'Environmentally Friendly' Recipes/meal plans out there?","I've been thinking about climate change and what to do for a while. There's lot of talk about how meat industry and transport of veg/fruit has a huge impact and changing your personal tastes can help.

So I've been thinking about changing my diet. Eating less meat, more chicken, vegetarian/vegan recipes, maybe rotating seasonal fruit/veg to rely less on food that had high air miles etc.
It might do nothing, but might be quite good (lot of large food companies have change business to react to healthy diets people want.)

Anyone else doing this? Any meal ideas worth trying or sources to pull ideas from?

So far found following sites which talk about seasonal foods to start building meal ideas from.
