The  project is to turn an old dairy farm into a cricket farm. We will also  be working to make a mining operation (ASIC/BITCOIN) to heat our farm.

Stay tuned for daily publication regarding our progress.

Why did we start a cricket farm ?

1. **Crickets are a much more eco-friendly than traditional meet.**

In  fact, crickets have a much lower impact on the planet. Its production  requires 12 times less fodder resources and about 2000 times less water.  Finally, it is also responsible for 100 times less greenhouse gas  emissions !

2.  **Offers better nutritional qualities.**

Cricket powder contains 2 to 3 times more complete protein than beef steak of equivalent weight. Crickets will also bring you more iron, more  vitamins, and more fiber.

3. **We want to help end world hunger.**

&#x200B;

World  population is slated to top nine billion by 2050, and seeing as how  arable land is being rapidly swallowed by towns and cities, oceans are  increasingly overfished, and climate change is disrupting traditional  farming. The report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization says  that eating insects could help boost nutrition and reduce pollution. It  notes than over 2 billion people worldwide already supplement their diet  with insects.
