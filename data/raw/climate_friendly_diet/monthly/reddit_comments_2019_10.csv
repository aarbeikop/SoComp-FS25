> if we experience a 5 degree warming by 2100 we may have 50% less grain to feed a 50% larger global population

It's like two combined independent projections. On one side we plan to have +50% population, on the other side -50% yield. That cannot work. The population won't rise as much if there is no food to sustain it.","2019-10-25 13:21:07","27","Koala_eiO","1747755727.844269","climate-friendly diet","manual"

"f55i28n","t3_dmsjz3","dmsjz3","collapse","skeptical","> For cereal crops, every 1 degree of warming leads to a 10% decrease in yields

Old and very basic estimate. Reality is non-linear, and is very likely to be much greater impact than 10% loss for every 1 degree after +2C to pre-industrial levels due to great number of indirect effects piling up and together smashing modern agricultural activities dead. For example, collapse of all kinds of eco-systems, especially important - in-soil eco-systems and biota.

> if we experience a 5 degree warming by 2100 we may have 50% less grain to feed a 50% larger global population

5 degree warming will mean much greater loss than 50% of grain production, in itself. Other consequences, few of which i mentioned just above, as well as other non-climate major damage to the agricultural endeavors, which is already taking place on global scale and many of which will inevitably yet massively worsen by 2100 - will further reduce the figure. Such as, for example, ongoing loss of genetic diversity of industrially-grown crops, which leads to bigger and bigger losses from bigger, more frequent and ever harder to get rid of pest outburts, exactly because evolution of pests gives more efficient (for pests) results vs poorer genetic variety of crops. Said loss of genetic diversity - is going on because ultimately, it is cheaper ""here and now"" for agriculturalists to work with a ""single variety"" rather than with a few different ones. And thus, again and again, they simplify their crops - which in the long run ruins their own business. But hey, ""who cares what will be by 2100, we need cash NOW"", eh.

> At just 2 degrees of warming, the Mediterranean and much of India will experience frequent droughts, straining global food supply.

Correct, but incomplete. In addition to said areas, also large parts of US, China, Brazil and other SA countries, Australia, central Europe are all going to experience that as well, if my memory about PDSI maps created by Aiguo Dai et al for +2C case is correct. Further warming will turn many of those regions into actual deserts, of course. Yet in the same time, a number of other areas in the world will experience huge increases in precipitation, of which two largest areas, iirc, are much of Canada and russian Far East. The latter already experience floods which destroy thousands homes and kill at least hundreds people, i heard.

Overall, in a hotter world, more precipitation takes place, because more evaporation due to higher temperatures. However rainfalls are on average heavier and less sustained, and air currents' change results in much different pattern of precipitation deistributon around the globe - while biosphere is not yet adapted to that new pattern. Thus regarding precipitation, ""too much"" and ""too little"" of it - will become new norm for much, if not for the most, of the globe.

> These rises would force hundreds of millions of people out of their homes as coastal cities all over the world are submerged.

Don't over-estimate this particular effect, however. I have no doubt that new ways to cope with that water rise will be found as the problem gradually becomes a major one. It is likely that majority of those forced to leave their homes - won't go any far, remaining in their region, merely finding ways to get them a new home in the area. Often, it'd be floating home, examples of which are relatively widespread already. It's often insanitary and comes with whole set of its own troubles, but we know it's what likely to happen, nonetheless. As many of those people won't have any better choice.

> we will have to invent new categories to describe hurricanes

A bit more precision, please? Category 6 will be quite enough, i read; thus just one new category, not more. Not that cat 6 ones are not deadly, of course - they will be unimaginably deadly; but just to be precise, you know, best to stick to the official terms.

> By 2090 2 billion people will be breathing air classed as unsafe.

Well, i'd be very surprused if that would actually happen. Instead, i expect the air by 2090 would be times cleaner than it is now, and also i expect number of people by then being much, much lower than 2 billion - total Earth human population, i mean. With Global industrial complex, as a whole, being non-functional for a few decades by then, the air will naturally clean as almost all kinds of tropospheric air pollutants - are washed down by precipitation and gravity in a matter of several weeks to at longest few years, depending on region.

> This resulted in a 100% fatality rate, 120,000 dead Saigas, and the Saiga becoming extinct in some countries. Its entirely possible that humans may experience a similar thing.

Not possible, in practice. Unlike deers and animals in general, humans are able to prevent succumbing to this kind of extinction. When you last heard of any kind of deers _themselves_ proceeding with any kind of quarantine, sanitation, sterilization methods, etc? Yet all those and such - are totally doable even post-collapse, with very little knowledge about it and very little matherials available. In other words, like it or not, but humans are unlikely to be wiped out by any sort of bacterial mutations. Those mutations, if/when occured, will be contained and will not affect the majority of human population. 

Now viruses are a bit different story, though. Especially man-made viruses. But that's whole different story... Which i hope will never unfold.","2019-10-25 12:51:05","8","Fins_FinsT","1747755727.861231","climate-friendly diet","manual"

Seriously, the solar cycles and our magnetic field should be our #1 worry right now. With a significant weakening of our magnetic shield, we're gonna cook/freeze/both, instantly. See Mammoths. -- Could kill us as soon as 2040.

Technology: artificial intelligence, mass surveillance, unhealthy levels of radio in the atmosphere for humans and other animals, especially those animals who can sense these waves of energy and become confused or sickened by them. Solar cell toxicity, wind generating bird blenders... We may go at any moment due to AI. Lots of people scoff at this. I argue they don't seem to understand what a general AI would mean and be capable of. Not to mention Neuralink.

Other: micro-plastic and nano-plastics being found worldwide. Already you can find these in almost all living animals, and almost certainly all humans. Long-term effects are unknown.

Magnetic pole reversal, though we have no idea what this will really do with our dependence on electricity in the modern age. There is a general belief the magnetic pole reversal will be slooooow and steady and have almost no noticeable effect on daily life. There is another idea that flip-flopping the Earth's magnetic field has more impact on Earth than we could possibly understand with our current level of science and evidence on the matter. Either way, a reversal means a weakening. See the next item.

Magnetic field (shield) weakening due to movement of the poles allowing for increases in solar particulate and radioactive matter entering the Earth's atmosphere and environment. This will irradiate massive areas of the planet. If the shield weakens enough that a sufficient solar wind gust could allow the solar wind (outer space) to touch the surface of the planet, instantly killing and sterilizing whatever it touches. Except for tardigrades. Those little cuteys survive.

Human causes: War, conflict, potential loss of support systems currently in place (police, fire, etc) due to riots/revolts/revolutions. Unchecked energy and resource consumption.

Edit: Adding radiation poisoning to the list thanks to rampant nuclear testing. All of humanity has traces of radioactive material inside them thanks to our nuclear madness in the 50s-80s.","2019-10-25 15:06:49","2","[deleted]","1747755727.87232","climate-friendly diet","manual"
