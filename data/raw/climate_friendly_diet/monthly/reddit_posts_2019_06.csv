"c103go","collapse","skeptical","Two Linked Essays on Ecological Catastrophe and the Value of Natural Diversity","Hello everyone! The two paragraphs below are a bit of a preface, you can skip them and read on ahead if you'd like, though I would recommend reading the essays in order.

I wrote these two essays over the course of months and thought they might be appreciated here. They approach the value of ecological diversity and the intrinsic good of the natural world from a new angle that I feel a passionate desire to share with you all. I do this for two reasons. For one, it's because I hope someone more philosophically sophisticated than me can help me to develop these ideas further. If that special someone could take over that task for me in their own work, using these musings as a springboard, I would be most grateful and would salute their efforts to develop their own insights. Either way, I hope I can inspire some thought on issues of climate crisis, human engagement, ecological diversity, and nature's creative tensions as an intrinsic good (on par with *or making possible* the goods internal to human practices and institutions). Secondly, I thought this might be entertaining and/or suggestive. I get the sense this sort of ecological thinking *on* *climate catastrophe* would be 'up the alley' of readers here.

Hopefully the tone of the writing is more passionate and less rant-like, but you can be the judge. It's around 4000 words in total so it will be under argued. It's also a bit disorganized and lacking in focus, so charitable reading is encouraged. If you've gotten this far and are curious about what I had to write, try to pick out a thread in the work that interests you and we can talk about it together. The hope is that we can find workable conceptual tools for the job of crafting a human sphere in proper harmony with the natural sphere. In broad strokes, I think this would require in our tools a rustic and reliable simplicity that doesn't devolve into depravity on the one hand, and a sophistication and ornamentation that isn't gaudy and impotent on the other.

>""There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.""

Here I want to share some passing thoughts about our need for the wild things. Not only because the wild things of nature are beautiful, but because they are our flesh and bones. The recent IPCC report has had me begin putting to words something that's been forming in me for years.

From what's came down to us in writing, it's clear that human history has been speckled all over with instances of strife and difficulty. There have been wars, famines, natural disasters, and on a smaller scale everyday conflicts which are known to almost everybody through experience. Often, these difficulties are found together and co-create one another.

Some would believe that we are now beyond great world wars and massive human suffering, but I fear we are about to enter the most serious trial that humanity has ever faced. Looking ahead, there is a vast darkness approaching. This darkness is made of not only the baleful emptiness of mass extinction, but of the apathy with which people wander on, as if it's someone else's problem.

Can we afford to risk any more of the lives of our cousins in the *cradle* that is Earth? On looking back, will we be filled with a terrible nostalgia for all the diversity and stability that the growth of healthy ecosystems afforded us? Can we afford to sacrifice the very creatures that breathe life into us, and in many ways make us what we are? As Emerson wrote;

>""The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.""

Humans as nature destroying nature cannot go on with such aplomb when we use more than can be naturally regenerated. This must end unless we feel confident we'll have the same complacency and equanimity in the wake of floods, crop failures, heat waves, conflicts, mass refugee crisis and the like. Regardless of how many countries away one is from these sorts of troubles, these things end up spreading out to effect us all.

*What we see now is only the beginning.*

Some people speak naively of our near potential to colonizing space as if a frail outpost on a dead land will be of any use to humanity at large or even to the human spirit. This is a mistake of the highest degree and must be admonished. There is no time for half measures, there is no time to deliberate, now is the time to begin dismantling the status quo. It's sufficient to say that we are not biologically suited for a life in a place with gravity that differs from our native earth gravity. Overcoming this hurdle alone would be an incredible feat for arguably little payoff in human flourishing. The result of achieving what to me seems undeniably sci-fi at this point would be at best a sort of feeble step backward into mere self preservation--life support for a mutated being that cannot walk freely any longer but must instead cling on within the narrow confines of its own artifice.

We must plant the trees that our grandchildren will live under. These sorts of long term group projects are the manifestation of our values and one of the most meaningful tasks human beings can put themselves to. These are the things that are part of our legacy. Not a task for some rudderless short-term gain, but the task of growing towards a future we wish we could inhabit in the present.

Like a person who sees a hungry tiger lunging towards them, we must act if we want to live. We now *know* pretty well what we need to do and what sacrifices need to be made, it's only a matter of doing it. Acting in concert as humanity as a whole is needed to avert this catastrophe. Humanity as a whole could be imagined like one large person who has each individual inside him. Is this sort of action possible for us? For example here is a rock. I can pick it up an set it down again without any concern. Can humanity as a whole pick up a rock? Where does the command to pick up the rock come from? Is it present initially in a previously experienced content that leads to an urge before the hand is readied? Is it the product of one tongue of flame that a cascade of actions emanate from? Does the body's unity in carrying out a task begin as a seed nourished where thousands of nearby seeds wither before they can branch?

This individual (humanity as a whole) could be said to have cancer due to disharmony with the natural order of things; maybe there is little that can be done. Individual cells are stuck in their positions and any radical dissent usually leads to apoptosis. Some cancers survive but most are killed before they start to redirect blood vessels to fuel their growth. The cancer of today has survived and has grown to a late stage where it now infects many different organs of humanity as a whole with its corrupting influence. More resources, more food, more power is given to the cancer which will ultimately leave us with a desiccated corpse. The goal here should not be to create another cancer, but to redirect blood though the individual expression of our values.

The need to preserve our *cradle*, the ground for our existence is to me the greatest ought of the 21st century, and on it all other things we feel we should be doing are made easier or possible. What I mean by this is that preserving our environment should be the primary concern in our time. The fact that a threat as serious as this isn't even being addressed with *half measures* can lead one to feel nihilistic, but this is to accept death and not to maintain life. There is still a chance to mitigate the worst, and this is our moral imperative. The way out of the vast darkness and the feeling it brings is to take action.

# For Living Arguments in Harmony - Musings on Eco-philosophy

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preface:

&#x200B;

Here I append a second, more disorganized essay. It's related in theme to the earlier one above; here for you to enjoy and hopefully place some charity in. I am not a professional philosopher or writer. In large part, what you'll find below is a jumbled collection of nature metaphors and passing thoughts mashed together. Try to plug some wet clay into the cracks and faults of this roughly molded toolkit (if it can be called that), to seek what we can shape together.

&#x200B;

*If theory is not deployed as lived situation demands, in close proximity to practical needs, it can easily become destructive--especially if its nature as generalization and existence within a holistic context is not remembered.* In order for our constructs to resound in fidelity with our lives, practical and theoretical ends should circle each other. As we are beings that spend time in both the subtle currents of air above and the roaring, grounded currents of time's river below, we must avoid being one-sided--merely floating above in high ideals or sinking below into anti-intellectualism. When air meets water and waves reach up; this is cultivation.

If all theories ever built were taken into account in decision making, the results would be proximal at best and require constant tweaking. Since no one has all of the collected thoughts of humanity at their disposal, it is impossible to avoid decisions made on limited information. When dealing with a vast, interpenetrating whole, generalizations should serve humble ends and not grow beyond our ability to keep the thought-objects contained; else they may fester and erode surrounding territory, reducing beings to mere static, a bit like collecting waves in jars and becoming one-sided. We cannot expect theory and the things it constructs to allow us to dominate the web of beings without losing what's most important about ourselves and potentially losing our lives. Theories and the practical constructions they often lead to are good if they are quick to dissolve, in order to be re-imagined. When views travel too far from grounding in the currents below, they often get sucked up in their own gravity, perpetuating themselves perversely and floating away. Sometimes this gravity pushes the waters below into powerful storm waves that crash into one another and stir muddiness into our stream. Engaging a framework from a dissolved context can be valuable, making the philosophers of the past relevant to us today. Our encounter with them in relation to the philosophical needs of our time and place can sprout new insights, like ancient, mossy stumps that nourish new saplings in their centres.

As Heraclitus remarked, strife is inevitable and integral to being a living thing:

>""Justice in our minds is strife. We cannot help but see war makes us as we are.""

Through conflict, we do the growing and developing that is living. But, there comes a point where trouble becomes too great for living beings to thrive. Do more problems emerge from our constructions and conjectures than from staying close to the ground, in accord with the competition demanded by the ecosystem and our other given currents? Can we allow our constructions and the theories that propel them to expand further while maintaining the living order we're joined with? Are more theories and constructs what leads to a richer life? Do our constructs end up serving goodness, broadly conceived, or do they often get misused? Is the balance more towards good, or bad? *Which of our ills are due to an overzealous urge to control, demarcate, contain, or outdo?* Is knowledge that hurts us ultimately knowledge, or (at best) does it exist more as trivia whose promise is left unfulfilled?

If an animal gets injured in nature, by necessity it is given a relatively quick death which may be more merciful than the many drawn out illnesses of modernity. Much sickness now is life long, and many of the old and sick are forced to live in sub-par conditions like living corpses, hardly more than husks of the things they once were. As examples of life long illnesses, many people are overweight or acquire diabetes through poor diet. More surprisingly, even the overweight are often malnourished through contact with foods from poorly cultured soils, which is a symptom of the larger disease. Only whole foods from whole soils nourish completely. There are many fields now where the soil acts as a mere substrate for roots to reach into. These soils lack much of the biodiversity that makes soil a living thing that strengthens the immune systems of plants and people. Chronic disease often begins in childhood. Asthma, allergies and some mental illnesses have much to do with a damaged environment which in turn damages us. Hurt people often hurt people, just as hurt environments often hurt people. Hurt people are not good for themselves or for their communities. With new chemicals entering our midst that take many years to decompose, the gravity of spreading disease threatens to suck us all in. *Does the gravity of our constructions loom over and force us to join their growing streams, filled with their own rapids and turmoils?*

Hamlets and small towns, like small moles on the skin, are a harmless and necessary human structure but maybe the mega city millions strong is akin to a festering wound, which healing cannot easily reach. These places are centres for diseases of all kinds, mental illnesses and general misery seem to abound there, where commutes are often hours long in smog, punctuated by dead lock. The effect of air pollutants on brain function are pernicious and subtle. Viruses spread easily between large groups of people, and numerous thought objects on billboards or contained in consumer items--without cohesion or necessity--collaged in the brain can reduce it to a dumping ground. Ads designed to manipulate bore into the skin like beetles into trees. Our roots go out to find something to connect to, but here the frenetic pace disrupts our ability to be and to linger, bringing a space to change directions. Trees in the city are usually gnarled and stunted. When a tree grows each insult to its bark remains and carries an influence on future growth patterns. In retrospect this seems unfair to cities, they may not be so bad if they are managed well, as many cities are in most respects. Does this read like someone who isn't fond of cities and who sees our time as marred by artificiality and unnecessary complications? Still, the paragraph touches on a number of issues and compares them to diseased or injured states in nature that may be worth developing further in the spirit of the rest of the essay.

*Technology and artifice need to be deployed reasonably; for the most essential human needs rather than for caprice or to make obsolete or otherwise demote the many crafts and skills that bring meaning to our lives.* We are tearing ourselves asunder with the many insults our artifice is cutting, creating an environment we were never suited for. This would be less of a problem if we had the capacity to engineer ourselves to match our new inventions, but we remain a thing of nature first and foremost. I doubt the various strands of lore in academia and industry, barely held together (usually talking past each other), can handle the task of engineering a new and potentially larger human sphere, let alone a new sort of human being, as we have done lesser tasks messily thus far.

One of the most essential human crafts is creating art and cultivating a culture. Art and culture are made better by our active participation in them. This participation is not just to critically view or listen to media, but to take part in creating it on a local level. The loving hand that shapes good art requires a mother's touch and a bit of local character in order to ring true. Is it not the case that mass culture's creations seem generalized, manufactured, and hollow? Is mass culture's form of art done as a means to an end, or as an end in itself?

Maybe art is not done best by mass culture, but by small communities engaged in a shared praxis who consume and create together. The end itself here is a loving outgrowth of expressive energy, as natural to humankind as using language or walking upright. As I think about it more, there may be a place for mass culture but it would stand behind local cultivars in importance, in order to encourage art to proliferate by many hands. Would this smaller scale creation help to encourage engagement? This could extend to other crafts as well, (e.g. the creating of shoes or clothes) so that each place could cultivate the products that it needs on a small scale with little waste. When people create the things they use or know the person that created it, they tend to respect the object more and take care of it. These sorts of items tend to be built to last, reflecting a concern for achieving down-to-earth ends and ease of dwelling through practice-theory harmony. Art that is built to last is art that is ready to be transformed by many hands through mimicry and a loving sort of collaboration over many generations. This art keeps the conditioning of the past while also allowing it to be molded into something new. Things that are built to last require constant patching, caring-for, being-with. People are beings built to last; they require caring for too. As the saying goes, 'no man is an island'. No art is an island, and no philosophy is an island either if it is to be alive and singing like a bird perched on a spring branch. Human frailties need to be healed by love in order to grow towards it.

In love, you may get a taste of the many beings resounding onto each other and being recycled into one another in the play of call and response; each of us being seen to contain the breath and skin of others, with time carrying our crossing waves. Everywhere love's sprawling roots must not wither or else the substrate that feeds them will begin to erode away as it depends on them; roots cannot draw life from solid rock. Instead rock (and living things) must be broken down into humble parts so that they're light enough to cycle in dirt. Dirt listens like a sponge absorbs. Holding fluid water like all organisms, it provides a place to cycle matter into new living language configurations. This fluid, active place is where a loving being pours itself out into its immediate surroundings.

Did the projects of enlightenment rationality with their characteristically detached approach to knowing contribute to the catastrophic destruction we now face? The discordance sown wavers through our lives and tears us to shreds along with it. We cannot help but be sucked into the gravity of our constructions. For all of the troubles of times past, at least catastrophe could be contained, the effects of discord were able to heal much more readily. Now, it is as if a big wound has been torn that may not begin to heal for generations. All coming to understanding involves a degree of playfulness that knows when to speak and when to listen. Without a diverse living ground to stand on, a vast sphere of inspiration is lost.

Much of what I'm saying may sound extreme, but we know we are currently in a mass extinction event. This means a loss of the many biological languages that resound along with us as parallel access modes towards being that foreground and background their own things in their own ways. I would contend that the dynamism and complexity of life is one of the most important things worth preserving and the loss of this diversity would be similar to losing the majority of the human intellectual tradition which gives us a rich and fertile ground to shape and inform our lives. Once a branch of culture (be it a species of plant or animal, or human cultures) is damaged, it is largely lost, contributing to a stale artificiality that contains little in the way of gradation and subtlety--the grist for future imagination.

When encountering the living things of nature we find beings whose biological languages are radically different from ours but regardless of the distance between the strains of our cultures, there is an uncanny similarity that speaks of differences in degree and not in kind. Though there is a unity beneath the ecosystem that allows it to be in relationship, the gaps between beings can be approached in an infinite variety of ways without exhausting the mystery of the beings themselves. This is one of the many reasons the natural world--as distinguished from the constructions of the human sphere--is an inherent good.

Each tree with its branching creates a related collection of beings that coordinate in tension, but more or less in a sort of harmony as well. In our time, it is as if one branch on this tree has grown too large to be supported without pulling the whole tree down. A mass extinction event is a bit like when a tree gets hit by a lightning strike, an area of life's web decomposes. This gnawning pervasive distress could return the tree of life to a sickly few shoots--a culture of only a few diverging branches. It is the effort of our branch to rule over all else that allows this illness to grow. It is in nature that we encounter something at once radically other, but in so doing we come to ourselves more fully as one living being among living beings. In looking on nature with fresh-eyed humility, a great secret is teased out in each blossom and twirling maple seed; in each bird light on the currents of sky. The spring sun casting hard light on high birch branches suggests loved ones lost and new beginnings by their graces. When seeing and hearing combine to witness the slow dance of thousands of shimmering leaves, does not god allow time to stand still?

Back when humankind had an even place in the collection of living beings, the world was often more bountiful. *Damaged ecosystems produce sickly fruits, but finding our place again within the tensions of our ecosystem is simple. The way biological beings--living arguments--refute each other, cross pollinate, and absorb one another; we need to be open to that sort of change ourselves by allowing space for these arguments to take shape and shape us. Through the wonder of simply standing under it, new shoots begin to sprout.* This requires stepping back and letting nature do more, leaving it alone to do what it does and argue and dispute as it does. Healthy relationships require relatively equal give and take in order to be sustainable. Life-arguments are trees growing, branches expanding into ever smaller crevices and spaces. Each niche and branch contains the pattern of the whole. Life arguments are ecosystems mutually supporting each other in argument, in tension. if the conversation becomes too one sided, a swing in the opposite direction is in the works. Even extinct forms still impart something of a shadow influence on what's new. Allowing space for each branch to blossom and lay groundwork for lichen covered bark allows a diversity of iterations that give life-arguments a multifaceted richness that the terrain would be desolate without. In being preserved in some form through time they are able to sing to us ever anew through the past's mediation inside the present. Without dwelling at the trunk, which all the branches of culture through time blossom from and hark back to, can we know where new branches need to grow and what needs to be pruned?

Primordially the newest growths and blossoms on the branches go forth in experience without affirming or negating the branches of tradition on which they developed. This position offers previous principles freedom to be affirmed or denied in light of conditions ever changing in the process of being. This position goes back to before the first forked branches of reason and is the soil in which our diverse and valuable conceptual seeds sprout anew. The seeds that put down roots and grow are not always the most ground-breaking, but are always the ones with appeal in a particular brain's branching ecology, that lure us to continue to nourish and develop the vascular pulsing of their resulting thought streams. Each step of the way we thrive in remaining open to the events of meaning that exercise us in the breath-like cycle of question and answer. In their sincerely being lived through we dwell with renewed understanding that resists the ever present risk of ossifying through passing into subconsciously held dogmas. Though it is impossible to be free from all prejudice, a place of immediacy and openness to questioning presents a living challenge to us that cannot be shied away from without losing the transformative quality that's present in all thriving life.

When humans and earth cross pollinate, entwine through intimately sharing the same space; harmony, creativity and new birth are possible. Through action inspired by new beginnings, a fresh take on culture and living can take shape, though if these structures are ossified and unresponsive the groundwork is laid for conflicts that betray the spirit of free expression and give-and-take. This is to be wary of constructing rigid scaffolds that stop light from shining out of the seeded ground of fidelity and creativity, that soil which nourishes and refreshes our branches with new leaves and blooms in every generation and season through growth and decomposition in equal measure.

*This talk makes small buds in many directions in an attempt to respond to issues of culture in our time. We should be careful that we don't suffocate ourselves like a snail in an ill fitting shell it constructed for itself.* I am not sure what this gathering of thought currents could develop into, or where the sorts of views expressed here may lead. Maybe it's important for us to return to the basics; listening to our bodies as a part of our minds, and remembering what's most important in our lives. This can help us to be sound judges about where and when to make use of knowledge in order to thrive. For many what matters most are our families and friends, and the health of body and mind that allows us to nourish and care for them and all that's alive. Within a common sphere where common sense takes place, sound judgement takes shape, though judgement cannot ultimately fit into to a ready made set of principles without reducing judgement's richness and integrative ability. When this faculty is well exercised and functioning as it should, we find it takes shape in the whole of our being. Sound judgement knows moderation, and is free from the shackles of the intoxicating acquisitiveness that's rampant in debased natures. Sound judgement prudently provides for wisdom's realization, and cultivates the virtues for its sake.
