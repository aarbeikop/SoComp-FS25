"an1jkf","climate","scientific","Trying to make a website - thoughts plz","Hi, I'm working on an idea for a ""green"" website for businesses. My main goal is to convince enterprises to reduce their footprint. I'm working on business cases like telecommute strategies, removing plastic bottles in conference rooms, leverage empty roof space for solar panels, lighting conversions, etc... 

But I also want to add articles for the personal life helping the average Joe save money by helping to fight climate change. The goal is tangible monetary gains for doing simple things. I guess the idea is to convince people to change their habits regardless of their thoughts on climate change. 

The vision is:  ""\[NAME\] is to be a thought-leader in developing environmentally friendly or net positive strategies for businesses. \[NAME\] is to become a hub for businesses to implement “green thinking” strategies. 

Tag line is:  **Every little bit counts, let’s start counting today, together for a better future!** 

I've been working on the telecommute strategy which is awfully painful to do (even if I do these sorts of things for a living). I'd love some help for less ""businessy"" stuff like introducing plant based diets (or at least reducing the consumption of red meat). 

Anyway thoughts are appreciated and thanks in advance. I want to help others do what I'm doing personally and my professional skills are really centered around making business cases, project plans and being an executive. I'm sure I can make some undeniable plans for businesses.
