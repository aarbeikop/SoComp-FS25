If we could make hydrogen gas (H2) from water (bacteria do it and, on a small scale, we can too), we could take that H2 and burn it with oxygen to make energy and water, which we could remake into hydrogen gas as a never-ending, nonpolluting source of energy. No CO2 in the equation. 

This was something that people looked at quite a bit about 15 years ago.  GM even built a [hydrogen-powered truck for then-governor-of-California Arnold Schwarzenegger to drive](https://newatlas.com/go/3378/), and there were several hydrogen-fueled bus demonstration projects. They generally turned out to be quite expensive to operate, and battery-electric systems have come to dominate the zero-emissions vehicle market.","2018-08-29 20:39:41","2","silence7","1747753873.0026839","climate-friendly diet","manual"
