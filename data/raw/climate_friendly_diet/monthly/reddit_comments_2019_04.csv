"eke52h6","t3_bat7ml","bat7ml","collapse","skeptical","You are absolutley correct.  Look at how bacteria and fungi etc. can affect organisms.  Cordyceps is a great example that most people know.  They are powerful. 

A few hours ago I was thinking that for all we know the psychopathy in today's society is entirely due to damaging our microbiome through poor diet and lack of contact with nature.

It's proven that poor gut health leads to depression and anxiety. Two things which can easily lead to hatred and paranoia.

Breastfeeding is super important and it's crucial to feed until the baby stops.  This is usually around 2-4 years old but can be even longer.  This is totally normal in undeveloped societies. In developed countries it's rare to see people breastfeeding past 6 months. This increases risk of so many things like autoimmune diseases, leukaemia, and mental illness.

The problem is the same as climate change though, most (almost all) humans don't care about evidence or logic. They just follow the herd and the herd is in a killing mindset at the moment.  Kill everything to stop it from killing us even though it's obviously better to facilitate life that will create balance. For example take probiotics instead of antibiotics. Even doctors don't follow the evidence because the drug companies aren't telling them about it in their medical journals.

But nope, we need to prevent that one death (billions of times we prevent a single death), so we save a person's life to the detriment of everyone else and our long-term survival.  Try telling people to do otherwise.  You first have to convince them there's even an issue, then you have to convince them to change, possibly risking their own or their child's life.  They won't do it because they're irrational.

We can hope for a cordyceps-like fungus to infect humans though. I was watching Our Planet and Attenborough said it infects any species that becomes too numerous. Hell, maybe it already has and that's why we're collectively committing suicide.  Maybe poeple like us here are immune to it.  Who the hell knows. We really don't know.

"eke9urb","t3_bat7ml","bat7ml","collapse","skeptical","Im honestly upset at how vacuous the majority of people are, this seems obvious to me now and it was obvious to me as a small child. I have vivid memories of me thinking as a kid (like age 8 or so) that we shouldn’t take antibiotics because we would get weaker. I didn’t understand what microbes or microbiomes were, but I could easily see the basic concept: taking antibiotics makes the your body not have to work to keep itself alive, if your body goes a while without “working” it will get weaker. Common sense right? Even to a kid it seemed really obvious- literally everything works that way, why would our bodies be any different? 



But apparently fucking not! it’s not obvious to a lot of people and as it turns out we are a race of fucking idiots and probably deserve what wver we get. The older I get the more and more disgusted I am to be an unwilling member of this society. It’s not fair, you grow up thinking society is a set system, that people are smart and make it work, but in reality everyone is just someone bitch! Theres like 100 rich people doing whatever the fuck they want and everyone else gets fucked. People are just winging it, and most people are greedy and cruel.

I don't know if it helps much but I go out of my way to eat fermented foods, especially non pasteurized eg. kombucha, yogurt, kefirs, saurkraut. My wife is Indian and they tend to keep a few jars of things fermenting like carrots, ginger, lemon, onion and it's super tasty.

I prefer to avoid them unless it really is necessary but I know too many people who will try to get them prescribed for absolutely everything and seem to be on antibiotics every other month for something or other. I've always put that down to them getting ill more often due to taking antibiotics more often thus weakening their immune system in a sort of vicious cycle type way. I am amazed however that on googling this just now it seems that a [study](https://newatlas.com/antibiotics-counteract-immune-system/52457/) from 2017 might be the first to point to antibiotics having a negative impact on the immune system and that prior to this it was assumed they didn't affect it at all. I had just always assumed they did harm it based on my own experiences. Of course I also could have just assumed that if an illness is serious enough to need them in the first place it could be the illness leaving you weaker but that only seems to happen if I've taken antibiotics so I always put the blame on them.","2019-04-08 16:35:59","5","Fredex8","1747754955.858378","climate-friendly diet","manual"
"ekedlug","t3_bat7ml","bat7ml","collapse","skeptical","First of all, it can be fixed.  I understand you believe FMT donors are the way, but there are microbes all around us.  Most Americans have only 4 major gut microflora.  I have 5.  One of my friends has 6.  (We did testing it was weird, anyway).

My point is the two of us spent more time in nature *eating things most people didn't* and that is why we had more microflora than everyone else int he group.  (That and I didn't start washing my hands until 21...a totally different story though)  

Basically, Go eat dirt or something...you'll get your fill.

>Thirty years ago, 2 percent of women developed infection after C-section. This was unacceptable, so now 100 percent get antibiotics as a preventive prior to the first incision.

Wrong. Whenever you eat antibiotics you clear out your gut flora. But that gets re-established after a few weeks. Antibiotics isn't a problem if they are used properly, i.e. you take them until you've killed off all bacteria within reasonable doubt. The problems arises when people go like ""I feel a lot better. Good, now I don't have to eat antibiotics any more"". That's when resistant are produced.","2019-04-08 17:34:52","-1","Dave37","1747754955.869003","climate-friendly diet","manual"
