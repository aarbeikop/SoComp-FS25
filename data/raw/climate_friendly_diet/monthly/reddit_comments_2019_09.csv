"f0w0gqj","t3_d6s6sj","d6s6sj","climate","scientific","Been vegan for six years.  Do it for the animals, and only for the animals.  I've put on 25 pounds during that time, and am now heavier than at any time in my 57 years of life.  I refuse to buy new clothes, so the only thing that really fits anymore are my mountain bike shorts with elastic waists, which is fine, since my bike is my car, and it seems like it's always warm now - even at night.  Plus, I figure I may need that extra body fat at some point soon, since the collapse is coming, whether the planet goes vegan or not.","2019-09-20 16:15:49","-1","[deleted]","1747755528.818656","climate-friendly diet","manual"

"f0zot9c","t3_d7fk7p","d7fk7p","collapse","skeptical","Herd grazing, breaking, and compression of soils and plant matter are essential to healthy soils. It is important to have animals graze and flee predators on soils to create necessary conditions for soils to thrive. Growing livestock is essential to healthy soils if it isnt done in a capacity that over grazes and destroys the microbiome of the soil. Essentially industrializing the process of raising livestock had made it a detrimental effect to healthy soil, but it is an absolutely necessary process for soil if done correctly or naturally.","2019-09-21 21:05:49","5","JasonAnderlic","1747755613.017327","climate-friendly diet","manual"
"f10erxd","t3_d7fk7p","d7fk7p","collapse","skeptical","I’m currently doing a PhD examining policy inaction on sustainable diets. 

While the focus of my research is not individual behaviour change or meat eating per se (it’s a political science PhD) what I have concluded over the course of  extensive reading in the area as well as conducting interviews with a wide variety of people (not to mention anecdotal data from reading thousands of comments on the internet) is that giving up meat is THE LAST thing people will ever contemplate as a mitigation strategy for climate change or ecological collapse. 

Even those claiming they do a whole range of other environmental behaviours baulk when giving up meat comes up.

I don’t know exactly why this phenomenon exists (I’m not a psychologist or cognitive scientist) but as a researcher I find it truly fascinating.","2019-09-22 00:17:46","4","Littlearthquakes","1747755613.021877","climate-friendly diet","manual"

"f11ebam","t3_d7fk7p","d7fk7p","collapse","skeptical","I became vegetarian about 19 years ago because of this. I knew back then that climate change was happening and that meat has a huge impact on the planet. Mostly I was upset with factory farming at the time, but I also knew that rainforests were being destroyed for cows. And trust me I loved meat. I really did. 

It’s not hard to phase it out. The meat alternatives on the market are really great now! Don’t go vegan right away. I really recommend just reducing first, then go to fish and milk and eggs. Then cut out as you see appropriate. 

I’m still eating fish and eggs primarily because of my children (it’s too late to follow the no kids rule for me!). They need b12 and I want them to be healthy. We reduce our milk intake.  I’ve tried to make my own vegan cheese but my god it’s awful. I buy slices now but the damn stuff comes in plastic packaging and that drives me nuts.","2019-09-22 03:53:46","1","slugbonez","1747755613.0284748","climate-friendly diet","manual"
