"5qwidz","environment","emotional","Meat is bad for the environment correct? Help me convince my friends so.","So recently I have been butting heads with my friends over this. I tell them how it affects climate change and other environmental issues and what not. But there argument is always ""there going to slaughter the cow/pig/chicken anyway so might as well eat it"". What I'm asking is how can I prove to them that eating less meat (not totally cutting it from your diet) will make an impact. Sources will definitely help out against them.
