What is the environment? In this sentence it serves as a noun. A person, place or thing. It appears to be singular instead of plural. We don’t say the environments, but really that might be a more accurate description. Here in Kennesaw Georgia I am in a house, the temperature is “room temperature”, there is now one dog (Zoey 4), Lizzie passed away today, three cats (Mia 19, Lalita ~4, Hobbes 8). 

There is a diversity of sitting materials including 6 recliners in the basement, chairs and stools in the basement bar, a downstairs bedroom, with a bed, dresser full of cotton and nylon clothes, different pillows, couches up stairs and cooking apparatuses. There are most likely cockroaches and mice, though I have yet to see one. Beneath us is most likely concrete, compacted soil, rocks, soil formations, aquifers, and the limestone plates. 

Above us is a roof protecting us from the elements. There are walls and insulation to engineer a climate specifically for our purposes. This is a unique climate and environment in an of itself, and five humans live here. These humans often have their daughter and myself, her fiancée, over along with extended family and friends. 

When we say we are environmentalists because we want to protect the environment, what environment are we talking about? And who or what are we protecting? 

I think that it would be more useful to understand that we cannot protect the environment because everything is “the environment” we must decide which environments we value, and which do not serve us. Are we trying to protect the trees of Kennesaw from being cut down to build a parking lot? Or are we trying to put in measures that reverse the pollution of the streams. 

But what if the environment we are trying to protect is a skyscraper, a house, or a car. We want to save this environment, to feed it, and for it to thrive. 

What about the environment within our human bodies? Do we care that trillions of microorganisms live in our stomach and eat the food we consume? We can feed and save this environment and microbiome by eating prebiotics from plant based products, or we can consume animal flesh and let it putrify in this environment. Gut biomes change, and consequences emerge. There is no right or wrong biome, only the consequences experienced from each biome which is our bodies. People who weight 300-400 pounds have an environment that is separate from that of people who weigh 150 pounds. 


We are all trying to preserve an environment, the difference is that we often preserve different environments. Those that we preserve flourish, and those that we disregard die out. If you change your diet, certain insects in your guy may go extinct due to a change in their food supply. Extinction happens on earth on a scale we cant fathom, but it even happens within us. 

The environment will go on indefinitely. Which environment that is and what that environment means for your everyday experiences and quality of life, is what we are after manipulating. We want to change environments to please our organism, and that of those with whom we relate. If we identify strongly with human family, we will attempt to preserve them. If we associate with humans, we will preserve them. If we associate with a chickadee, we will preserve them. If we associate with a certain plant we will observe it and perpetuate. 

But we are not the only actors on this stage. What about the other insects, the other mammals, and the other plants? What about the birds, and the bees? They all perpetuate the environments that meet their needs. The environment will survive without our help, it just might not be ideal for the human species. There is a mushroom that feeds on plastic. There are organisms I’m sure will one day feed on this mushroom. Life will continue even if there are more water bottles in the oceans than fish. Life will move on. 

I am not attached to the human race because the matter and particles that compose my body are always changing, leaving from my body and entering my body. When they fall off, are they still part of the human? What if an animal eats these dead cells, still human? Does it even matter what the arrangement of the particles are? The particles will continue to dance as they please with or without my help, I might as well let them enjoy their time and enjoy my own personal environment in the present moment.

So take this as a reflection. Ask yourself, what environments matter to me? Which environments do I choose to sustain and which will I stop supporting? Let us see our goals in terms of protecting certain environments and let us specify the species we wish to protect.
