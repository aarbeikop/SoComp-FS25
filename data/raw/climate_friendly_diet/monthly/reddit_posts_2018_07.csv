"9147zw","climatechange","action-oriented","A science parable of diet and climate change","Energy is something every life form needs, every moment of every day.  Humans get our energy by eating food and combusting it to carbon dioxide and water. It is estimated that 1 in 8 people of the world do not get enough to eat (that’s 815 million people) and 36 million people starve to death every year. On the other hand, about 2/3 of Americans are overweight or obese. 

Let’s say you wanted to figure out what were your daily calorie needs, so you could live a healthy life. Too few calories and you are underweight; too many calories and you are overweight. To determine this scientifically, you would have to start keeping a record of every type and precise amount of food and drink you consumed every day to know exactly how many calories went into our body. As a good scientist, you might want to consider additional variables such as how much protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and fiber you consumed, but for this example let’s go with just the calories. You would also have to keep a record of all of your daily activities every day to know how many calories you burned. In other words, you would have to become scientist and collect a lot of data over an extended period of time. 

So many factors make it all sort of complicated, so you might need to do different versions of this experiment, limiting the variables in any one experiment. A single day’s worth of data would not answer the question. Even one week of data would not be enough, because of natural fluctuations that occur in life. How much water do you drink, how much sweat do you lose, when do you go to the bathroom and what time of the day is it? Did you weigh yourself when you woke up or after a meal, with your clothes on or off? Is it a holiday celebration or a busy workday? As you can see there are many variables. That’s the way it is in most science experiments. It’s not like flipping a coin and seeing heads or tails. 

Let’s say you started off with a healthy weight of 130 pounds and found that after one month of data that your body required 2,000 calories to maintain that body weight. Now, the way we use the word calorie in foods is a bit misleading. A food calorie is really a kilocalorie (kilo means 1,000). So a food calorie is really 1,000 small calories. As a scientist, you need to know that a small calorie is the amount of heat (energy) that will raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius. In American units, that is about 1/28th of an ounce, 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That means 1 kilocalorie (1 food calorie) would equal heating 1,000 grams of water (about 2.2 pounds) 1 degree Celsius. That is the same as 1 liter of water, which is about 1 quart of water (1 liter = 1.1 quart). When you think about it, 2,000 food calories is a lot of energy. That would be equal to heating 2,000 liters of water (4,400 pounds of water) 1 degree Celsius or heating 1 liter of water (2.2 pounds), 2,000 degrees Celsius (of course, it wouldn’t be water any more, it would be steam). Assume you limit yourself to 2,000 calories a day for an entire year, and keep your same exercise schedule and your weight doesn’t fluctuate a single pound. You have used science to improve your life. 

Now, suppose a friend came over and introduces you to Oreo cookies. You love them and start eating 1 Oreo cookie every day as a treat. In case you were wondering, an Oreo cookie has 45 calories, which is composed of 27 calories of carbohydrates, 16.5 calories of fat and 1.5 calories of protein (data from the research of other scientists). Let’s just say that an Oreo cookie has 50 calories to simplify our calculations. You look up in the literature and discover that there are 3,500 food calories in a pound. (Notice that you are trusting accepted results of other scientists.) You know what is going to happen. You start eating 2,050 calories a day, which is 50 calories over what you body needs to stay at 130 pounds and you are no longer in energy balance. This doesn’t seem like a big deal because 50 calories is hardly anything, and besides you wouldn’t even notice if you gained an extra pound. After all, how long would it take to gain 1 pound? That turns out to be a simple calculation. It would take 70 days.

1 extra pound = (3,500 calories)x(1 Orea/50 calories)x(1 day/1 Oreo) = 70 days to gain 1 pound

Let’s say this becomes a habit that you don’t stop for 10 years. You keep recording your calories, exercise and weight and this is what the data might look like at 2050 calories per day. 

extra weight in year 1 = (365 days)x(1 pound/70 days) = 5.2 pounds

year 0 = 130 pounds

year 1 = 135 pounds

year 2 = 140 pounds

year 3 = 145 pounds

year 4 = 150 pounds

year 5 = 155 pounds

year 6 = 160 pounds

year 7 = 165 pounds

year 8 = 170 pounds

year 9 = 175 pounds

year 10 = 180 pounds

You might think your basal metabolism would go up because you are carrying more weight, but you also might become less active because you are carrying more weight. Those are other variables that would have to be determined scientifically. Let’s assume they cancel in this parable.

Even though 50 calories is not very much, and you might not even notice the extra pounds at the beginning, the fact that it continues for 3,650 days adds up to an extra 50 pounds of body weight. You might start to notice after a year or two. There are additional downsides of gaining so much weight, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and more. It was just one little cookie a day that got you into this potentially life-threatening situation. 

You know what should have happened. You could have eaten 50 calories less in our daily diet, or you could eat 350 calories less one day a week, or you could exercise 50 extra calories every day. There are lots of ways you could modify your lifestyle to eat the 1 Oreo a day if you understand the energy inputs and outputs. If you did happen to find yourself 50 pounds overweight, you would have (50 pounds)x(3500 calories/pound) = 175,000 calories to lose. You couldn’t lose that weight in a day, a week or a month. If you completely quit eating, and still had a basal metabolism of 2,000 calories per day, it would take us about 73 days to lose 50 pounds. That’s over 2 months of starvation. Of course, when you starve yourself, your body slows its metabolic weight to try and keep you alive, which means it would actually take longer because the calories you burn go down. Also, your body starts to break down protein to maintain glucose levels so your brain cells don’t die. If the protein comes from your heart, it might stop beating and you would die. Starvation is a very poor strategy to achieve a long term healthy lifestyle. If you cut out 500 calories a day, it would take about one year to lose the 50 pounds. That means, no cheating every day for a year. You would need discipline of steal. 

And that’s what’s needed to address climate change. Carbon dioxide, methane and other gases are the calories.  The life-threatening outcomes include increasing temperatures, sea level rise flooding coastal cities and salt water corruption of water tables, deltas and rivers. Increasing ocean acidity will devastate corals and other sea life. Expect more severe droughts, fires and storm events and, very sadly, loss of animal diversity. Instead of thinking in days, weeks and months, think of decades, centuries and millennia. Maybe you are too old to care what happens. Or maybe you have kids and grandkids and even the unborn that you hope will have a good life. 

The odds of many of the tragic events of climate change are way higher than the odds of flying on a plane with a terrorist present. Yet, think about the inconvenience and expense you allow for the plane versus the effort you are willing to put forth to protect the future of humanity and other life on earth. Is it a weekend at Las Vegas, or is it a matter of life and death?
