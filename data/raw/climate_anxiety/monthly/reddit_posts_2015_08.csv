"3fryc6","climate","scientific","Trying To Be Optimistic, Find The Will To Fight [x-post from /r/environment]","I've always been aware of climate change and have done little things here and there to do my part. The truth is, I didn't realize until this past week just how bad things were until I stumbled into a thread about it. Since then, I've been actively making lifestyle changes, but I cannot escape the feeling, especially after Obama's plan yesterday not hitting as hard as it should and the fear that the Paris talks are not going to really do enough, that we are completely doomed and hopeless.
Yet, many people that I've been reading keep going. I'm trying to find that light in the dark. Everywhere I look, it just seems like we've lost the fight already and are doomed. I haven't been able to even find a single shred of optimism regarding climate change. I just get hopeless thinking about even trying to fight for the cause and I'm now at the point that I have severe anxiety and depression from it.

I'm obsessed with thinking about it and cannot get it out of my head. I'm just absolutely terrified that the next generation is going to be totally screwed and that the end of my life will be awful. Given a lot of you are in the rough ballpark of my age group (I'm 27), I'm sure you can relate to this in some way.

I'd like to know - where do you find the will to keep fighting? How do you ward off the anxiety that comes with knowing that extinction is on the brink? What, if anything, is making you optimistic that we'll at least mitigate SOME damage?","2015-08-04 18:21:48","12","53","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3fryc6/trying_to_be_optimistic_find_the_will_to_fight/","True","skyturnsred","1747752935.61126","climate anxiety","manual"
