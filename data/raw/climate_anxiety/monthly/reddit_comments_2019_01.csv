"ef23dav","t3_99ijce","99ijce","climatechange","action-oriented","I know this post is five months old, but I stumbled across it when I typed in 'anxious about climate change' into google. Also in my mid-twenties, entered a relationship that has a high possibility of being long term and maybe embark on a exciting, fulfilling career. I know how you feel.  


I support various protesters. You get updates on what they plan to do, and it's good to read what hundreds, or even thousands are going to do to make people listen. When a leader puts their mind on going renewable, shit seems to develop fast.  


If you still need it, I read /r/RenewableEnergy frequently, but don't do it obsessively. [This](https://www.businessgreen.com/category/energy) is a website called business green, and while you have to be logged in (and paying) I think to read the actual articles, there's nothing stopping you copying and pasting into google and finding information elsewhere. It's also very up-to-date. I know a few oil companies, including BP are investing into renewables even if it's a pittance or a 'modest' sum.   


It's... slow. And painful. I totally understand. Read the success stories. Don't try to predict what could happen, and don't predict the oil industry, who the fuck knows. Anything can happen within months, I can't imagine within a few years.","2019-01-27 00:36:52","1","Cherish_Dipp","1747785925.6041868","climate anxiety","manual"

"edn9lyu","t3_ae7kz9","ae7kz9","climatechange","action-oriented","Much as I hate to say anything here in defense of climate trolls, they're just arguing in bad faith — they're not responsible for anybody's death. And seeing through their claims is reasonably simple, since trolls typically haven't developed their arguments to withstand the merest rational scrutiny.

Anyone who believes that their suicidal ideation results from (poorly-supported) apocalyptic climate conjectures...is also being triggered by other, more powerful factors much closer to home. That's where treatment would need to focus.","2019-01-09 17:11:07","8","DocHarford","1747786065.434408","climate anxiety","manual"

"edncypp","t3_ae7kz9","ae7kz9","climatechange","action-oriented","I think it's silly to ""tap out"" early, because of an uncertain future.

Do I think climate change is going to be really ""bad""? Yes.

Do I think that somehow justifies suicide? Not at all. It's not bad *yet*, and we don't know *how bad* it will get within a given persons lifetime.

Also, it's not like there won't be ways to kill oneself in the future *if* things get *so bad* that, for some reason, being dead is preferable to living.

In addition, we are living in (IMO) the most interesting and exciting times in human history. Why would anyone choose to exit /turn off the show/close the book *now*??

No, I think that people who consider committing suicide because of ""climate change"" are simply using it as an excuse for some much deeper rooted problems. ","2019-01-09 17:47:26","4","InvisibleRegrets","1747786065.441715","climate anxiety","manual"
"ednejm7","t3_ae7kz9","ae7kz9","climatechange","action-oriented","For the vast majority of people living in the developed world you will not be more than inconvenienced by climate change in the next 50 years. 

Those in tropical storm affected areas may have more frequent evacuations. You may need to spend more on air conditioning or see an increased risk of flood, for a small number flood insurance will become unaffordable. 

People with far less resources and societies with less resilience however will bear a much heavier burden. ","2019-01-09 18:03:35","5","[deleted]","1747786065.444119","climate anxiety","manual"
"edo5j3e","t3_ae7kz9","ae7kz9","climatechange","action-oriented","Suicide is generally caused by a impulsive action to take one's life, climate change might cause anxiety and exuberant the impulse, but I believe the underlying cause is always a mental illness. 

Modernity has been a wild ride, but we need to stay afloat and not become too irrational even if everything seems hopeless. Fuck idiots who deny climate change. ","2019-01-09 23:03:48","3","[deleted]","1747786065.4460921","climate anxiety","manual"
"edqsxh9","t3_ae7kz9","ae7kz9","climatechange","action-oriented","I read a dystopian book once where there was a food or oxygen shortage, something, but the government would give your family $20,000 to euthanasia yourself so you wouldn't weigh down on the system anymore. We might get there one day if people don't stop mindlessly reproducing so much.

"edn2s8b","t3_ae7kz9","ae7kz9","climatechange","action-oriented","Yeah, for me the extent of the denier propaganda, and the mindset of the fossil fuel interests that fund it, and the fact that it actually works, all make it a lot less appealing to continue spending time with the human race. 

However it does make life more meaningful to be fighting such a big and evil power.  And I think we'll prevail. And humanity will have all the time it needs to develop into something better.","2019-01-09 15:47:28","1","messageinmoss","1747786065.449224","climate anxiety","manual"

If anyone is depressed about climate change to the point that this occurs to them, consider therapy and/or meds. You can also directly work to reduce climate change...
