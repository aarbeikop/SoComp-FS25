You would have thought the calls would be about boy-girl stuff, bullying, grades, parents, acne...etc.

Nope.  The number one and two things were climate and collapse.

Kids don't see any future at all, and even the present doesn't make any sense to them because of that.  Old people are acting crazy.  Who cares about getting a D on a geography quiz when the whole world is falling apart.  How can kids take anything old people say seriously?

"eyp5sre","t3_cxzswj","cxzswj","climatechange","action-oriented","The big problem is that young people are anxious about climate change but don't really know enough about it. So it's become almost mythicized as this apocalyptic doom that will turn us into the walking dead. While true, the situation is dire, there's shit we can do to stop the worse of it. People we can elect, policies we can implement, the science is right there. Anxiety doesn't help, it paralyzes, what we need now is resolve.

If you're feeling anxious about climate change, I recommend you take Michael E Mann's free course on climate change. The knowledge of what exactly Climate Change is, and what it's not, will help you make better decisions and help you discover exactly what you and your community can do to help.

I noticed the link the first time myself, when we had been stuck in gridlocked traffic for a long time during a road trip (later the news would tell us it was the worst traffic day in that country's history due to some holiday), and I suddenly started having a really intense panic attack out of nowhere. I'd already been thinking about how fucked the environment was with all that traffic, but I was pretty sure I hadn't psyched myself into that bad of a freak out just via negative thoughts. However, because my brain was already considering air pollution, I glanced at the car console, and realized that the air circulation knob kept automatically pushing itself back to intake external air from the car in front of us. Now when I'm in that car, I constantly have to push that thing back to circular our own air, or else it pulls in surrounding fumes, and my severe panic attacks alert me that the stupid thing has reset itself again (I'd sell or scrap the damn thing in a heart beat if it was mine, but I'm not the main driver).

For more in depth and practical information the [Journal of Urban Design and Mental Health](https://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com/journal-4---air-pollution-and-mental-health.html) gives a bit of an idea of what we're up against, and what we can do about these issues.","2019-08-31 20:59:17","7","sheilastretch","1747791640.183049","climate anxiety","manual"

"ewr9dzj","t3_cpqorq","cpqorq","climatechange","action-oriented","I mean, AFAIK there are many climate scientists who range wildly in the scale of optimism and pessimism, but there is not a single one whose words is taken with respect in the community that believes there is no hope. 

So on that note, there is either this elaborate conspiracy where literally all climatologists agreed to lie to public, or maybe they know something more than general public does when it comes to climate change, and are also aware of studies that show people are more active in fighting climate change if they are anxious and panicked but hopeful, and that, speaking generally, science shows that there is hope. The latter seems more reasonable, but I get the allure of conspiracy theories.

>As the climate gets worse and worse, will we have to start thinking about how to calm people's climate anxiety?

We would first need discern how much of that anxiety is based on scientific facts and how much of it is based on dogshit they hear on internet forums or mass media. Because I'm pretty sure that non-peer reviewed study about how society would collapse by 2050 got a lot of people to flip their titties, or how much of it is stuff like Uninhabitable Earth, which nitpicks worst case scenarios without talking at all about their chances of then happening. In short, how much of it is *real* and how much of it is mass media feeding giddily on people's anxiety and defeatism.","2019-08-13 12:26:17","6","Webemperor","1747791708.465665","climate anxiety","manual"

"ewrn2ov","t3_cpqorq","cpqorq","climatechange","action-oriented","A few months ago, [Gavin Schmidt](https://twitter.com/ClimateOfGavin) wrote about how people - scientists, laymen, and everything in-between - [interpret best-and-worst-case scenarios in climate projections.](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2019/02/the-best-case-for-worst-case-scenarios/) I'd recommend giving it a read if you haven't already, it touches on a lot of the points you're talking about. Personally, I think the argument over scientists trying to stay over-optimistic is a little underweight. It's going from the opposite angle as a regular denier argument, almost word for word. If you'll forgive me:

>I see them proclaiming ""scary"" studies where if we don't do something  10 or 12 years from now, we'll see this echosystem being damaged or that  irreversible effect. 10 years from now seems, to me, the perfect number to pick where it gets people's attention but just distant enough that  we feel **\[scared\]**. A lot can happen in 10 years, right?

You're right that scientists may eventually give us another X-years to reduce emissions to a certain level. After all, each of these deadlines and figures are to have the best shot at avoiding certain degrees of warming, which progress into higher risk for MORE warming because of climate feedbacks and... well, everything else. Heck, the current ""11 years"" deadline's been interpreted from that [1.5 Degree IPCC Report Summary](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/). Some people have made that out to be ""WOAH, the WORLD'S ENDING IN A DECADE"", which obviously isn't what that report said.

>**A.1. Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a** ***likely*** **range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is** ***likely*** **to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (*****high confidence*****) (Figure SPM.1) {1.2}**  
>  
>**A.1.1.** Reflecting the long-term warming trend since  pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST)  for the decade 2006–2015 was 0.87°C (*likely* between 0.75°C and 0.99°C) higher than the average over the 1850–1900 period (*very high confidence*). Estimated anthropogenic global warming matches the level of observed warming to within ±20% (*likely* range). Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (*likely* between 0.1°C and 0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions (*high confidence*). {1.2.1, Table 1.1, 1.2.4}

&#x200B;

>**C.1.3** Using global mean surface air temperature, as in AR5, gives an estimate of the remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO2 for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 420 GtCO2 for a 66% probability (*medium confidence*).

If we're crossing that 1.5 Degree threshold - which, even though it isn't fated, is pretty likely - doesn't it make sense to make another deadline to the next ""acceptable"" level of heating we want to avoid? EDIT: I mean, all of this happens on a scale of effect. The higher we warm, the more dangerous our world gets. You're right that our current greenhouse gas levels are absolutely dangerous; that's the point. We're already in painful territory, and we want to keep it from getting even worse. Meeting particular deadlines pushes up the chance at succeeding in that.","2019-08-13 15:14:57","2","RatherConfuzzled","1747791708.479861","climate anxiety","manual"
