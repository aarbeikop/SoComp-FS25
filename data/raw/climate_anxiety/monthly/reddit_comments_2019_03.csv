"ei7fuz3","t3_aqdmbz","aqdmbz","climatechange","action-oriented","climate change isn't just going to pop up and murder people, you're going to have a long period of economic decline where people get really really unhappy and that's probably where you will see the greatest chance to make large gains in the big ideas to combat climate change.

I'll say it again and time will prove me right, reduction is not going to be enough to stop a couple billion people from dying. you need to take active measures which effectively include offsetting the geoengineering of 7.7 billion people living on the planet with some type of geoengineering that helps keep earth's climate in check.

there really isn't a natural solution scenario here, climate is not that stable. Humans developed in a window of an ice age and cooling trend and much of the planet's history is quite the opposite.

So, even the most ardent environmentalist needs to admit that this climate that were all used to is destined to change and essentially murder most of humanity. Sure, maybe it wasn't going to happen for another 10 million years, but that was then and this is now. The natural course has been interrupted and it's going to take an artificial effort to correct it beyond out of just reduction.

Even the natural cycle of 80,000 years of cooling in 20,000 years of warming is not something that humanity would be able to come anywhere near surviving at today's population levels.

If you embrace the idea that we can just reduce and let nature fix things, you're still embracing reduction of human population as one of your primary solutions. since we're going to need technology to keep this planet's climate anywhere near the threshold that humans are used to over the last ten thousand years, I think everyone just needs to get used to the idea that we're going to have to actively tweak the climate well beyond that of what nature would do because at the end of the day nature's big plan is to eventually make humans go extinct.

In the more short-term model the predictions of massive economic decline caused by global climate change as well as billions of people's lives being put at risk is also a good reason to not put all our eggs in the greenhouse gas reduction basket unless of course you're okay with the inevitability of billions of people dying as part of your solution.

We're going to have to actively attack CO2 and methane and pull it out of the atmosphere and perhaps even block solar insolation from adding so much heat to the planet. 

In 50 years or so we're going to be at a catastrophic level of climate change that causes massive economic decline and global instability and almost certainly world war and that's only about 50 years away.

I don't believe even if we met reduction goals tomorrow that we would stop rising temperatures from releasing even more methane over the next few decades and then you're going to have to face that temperature spike and essentially unknown amounts of methane release and damag ecosystems.

The biggest climate threat of CO2 is that it's going to release the methane stores which will have a far more profound and rapid impact than just co2. So, the problem will become exponentially worse and that's why I taking extreme measures is going to become the more and more obvious option.

I'm sorry we're going to have to geoengineer the planet, but technically we already did when we build all these houses and roads and farms. All I'm really saying is you're going to have to geoengineer your geoengineering. 

I've been getting downvoted for like a decade for saying this. Convincing that many people and that many nations to meet reduction goals is probably actually a much more difficult goal than just engineering CO2 and methane and ocean acidification down to levels that we can deal with. And yes, as ridiculous as it sounds blocking out the sun a little bit is going to become a more and more practical idea. it's not nearly as bad as it sounds and volcano is essentially naturally do it all the time, but it clearly still has to be coupled with reduction and that should go without saying if your scientifically minded enough to even understand this post.

I'm disappointed about how many supposed environmentalists and climate change activists don't want to hear anything but reduction and minimalism. to me it seems like you're dragging your feet and risking billions of people's lies. Even back in 1980 you were probably inevitably on this path where you needed technological solutions to manage the climate beyond just reduction, because the world's a big place with a lot of developing nations and they're all going to go through intense periods of pollution. 

We're still barely focused on agricultural pollution and very much obsessed with fossil fuel pollution and that's not really the full spectrum solution that you would need even if bet everything on reduction. You've been able to cut back your meat consumption for decades and have far more impact than buying an electric car or solar panels, but what percentage of progressive liberals have given up meat? You need to listen to the scientists and not just the journalist!

I think the childfree life is great. But anyone who thinks otherwise is totally justified in giving ZERO consideration to global-climate issues. The global climate is a colossally vast system that doesn't respond, at all, to decisions made on the level of an individual family. (As long as the family business isn't burning down entire forests, probably.)

People who base their individual decisions on their effect on the global climate...probably aren't making their decisions rationally. Anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics can see that their individual decisions aren't significant on a global scale. 

But having a family can bring INCREDIBLE joy to people on smaller scales — the personal, extended-family and community scales. So those are the factors that people should consider when making family-planning decisions.  ","2019-03-26 15:09:45","21","DocHarford","1747787618.1771882","climate anxiety","manual"

"ejf9ubx","t3_b5qeq8","b5qeq8","climatechange","action-oriented","I want kids. My partner and I aren't serious enough that we have talked much about having kids together, but we both share anxieties about climate change and how difficult the latter half of this century is going to be. I do not plan on having children. The safety window for climate change to be mitigated without massive instability later this century is closing fast and we have taken little to no action to begin moving the needle back on emissions. If more recent models are correct and the climate is more sensitive than we had previously thought (the range from CMIP5) certain mitigation scenarios might already be impossible to achieve.

Now, I'm not a 'doomer'. I don't think civilization is going to end and I don't think that humanity is going to go extinct. I do think that the quality of life in my home country is going to suffer immensely, and isn't likely to improve in my or my potential children's lifetimes. My country is going to desertify and run out of water, and my home town will likely not exist by the time I am old.

I do not delude myself into thinking that my actions have a global impact- they don't. But they do have a local impact in that I won't have to face my future child and have to apologize that their adult life is going to be full of hardship because I chose to bring them into the world.

One could make the argument that life, up until very recently, for every human has been full of hardship- and that is true. But I'm not a subsistence farmer or a member of a hunter-gatherer tribe. I don't need children to work the fields or hunt deer. There is no reason for me to bring a life into this world to have it worse than I have had it, and by all accounts there is nothing that special about me that humanity would benefit from passing it along- I'm remarkably average.","2019-03-26 15:41:40","10","Freeze95","1747787618.181309","climate anxiety","manual"
"ejfd5kh","t3_b5qeq8","b5qeq8","climatechange","action-oriented","When I first learned the true extent of how bad things are, I was very against having children. It was always tough though, because it wasn't a financial issue and both our families would love new additions (not to mention if I don't have kids I'm the last of my line, if you will, based on my small extended family). All things being equal, I would probably not have kids both from a personal comfort level - more freedom and money - and an environmental/social level - I think human beings are generally trash, and of course we are likewise trashing our planet. 

&#x200B;

But I've done some thinking and I am changing. First, as a privileged, white American citizen in a stable and developed part of the country, the biggest threats I'm looking at for my children are 1) war, 2) nuclear radiation, 3) some sort of environmental food system collapse, 4) fascist or autocratic government.  The most likely result is more scarcity and some really bad situations in the drier parts of the world or parts that are subject to severe weather. Scarcity doesn't bother me, nor does it bother me to subject my children to scarcity (generally confident first world major city scarcity will not be soviet kulak era stuff). My grandparents brought a depression era identity to my family and we are fine with simple pleasures. On the more dangerous side, war is what every generation in the world, including Americans, dealt with up until the 1970's. The same can be said of autocratic governments; humans have lived under such conditions for 90% of their existence and still produced families and seemed somewhat happy about it, despite life being hard and with less freedom. Nuclear radiation would really suck though! Ultimately, people throughout history have had families in really bad situations, and I don't think I'm that exceptional from those folks. 

&#x200B;

I am also excited to try and raise a new generation with a new mindset and ideals. We have a fairly self-sufficient urban farm, and I am nearing full electrification with solar panels. My activities are based more around substantive items (sports, outdoors, wood instruments) than television or easy pleasure technology. I am also engaged in both traditional politics and the environmental movement to try and blunt some of the impact.

And it makes me fucking SAD. I would be a wonderful mother, and I wanted the opportunity to experience that. But knowing that my children could be faced with absolute chaos at some point in their lives (hell, even my generation could very well be faced with it before we die)...nope. Not doing it. 

I still get sad about it at times, but the reality is that I don't see it as a choice at this point.

I have a raft of reasons to not have children. I could write a book about it.  I thought my mother would interfere with my parenting. I thought and still do that bullying starts in the home. Why would I want to put my trauma onto a child like my mother did to me? And like her mother did to her. Initially I also thought that the Faboks were cursed. I had the power to cause that line to end in my country. But there are some others someone else. I hated my father. But it was just thel trauma talking. He was an alcoholic. He died many years ago. 

Then I learned about the Environment. And then I learned about exponential growth. But I already knew about poverty, scarcity, trauma, and a fear of authority. Again, no good reason to breed amongst that lot.

"eji5poy","t3_b5qeq8","b5qeq8","climatechange","action-oriented","I called this ""the pressure to be green"". It started when I was in university. This was before our city had roll-out recycling bins. The only way to recycle properly would be to ""rent"" or subscribe to a company to come get your stuff once a week. It was very complicated and very expensive. So I was always bothered by it! Then we got roll-out bins and it started to get easier.

Flash forward 7 years to living in a different city. Once again, no roll out bins. But, there was a depot (parking lot with a bunch of different bins in it) down the street from us. Perfect! We did cardboard and paper, household glass, household plastics, metal, etc. Our pop bottles, cans, milk cartons and jugs, etc. we always brought in for the refund money (though the provincial recycling waffled back and forth for years as to whether or not they would accept and/or give refunds for the plastic milk jugs....) I felt good, finally, that I was able to at least do my part successfully.

2 years later, we get roll-out bins in this city. Okay, fine. At first they take everything - even plastic grocery bags! THEN, there is a huge lawsuit in the city I used to live in against the recycling company. Turns out they were taking household glass but didn't have the facilities to actually recycle it, so they were throwing it in the landfill themselves! The lawsuit was because they charge the city by weight for the recycling and the heaviest thing - glass - was being chucked in the garbage on their end. So this was fraud. The same company did the same thing in our city, too.

SO! Now there is no household glass taken in the bins. Okay, fine. I'll take it to the parking lot depot. Nope! City got rid of that after the roll-out bins were provided. So now what?! I literally have nowhere to go to recycle it. 

Also the roll out bins took plastic grocery bags. Amazing! Until they didn't. Turns out China was the biggest buyer/recycler of the bales of plastic bags and the cost was no longer effective for them so they aren't buying our country's plastic bags anymore.

I have often felt so guilty about my abilities to properly recycle. I hear stories about every fish in the sea - even the deepest parts - coming out with plastic in their guts. I even asked on here in a Explain it like I'm 5 post as to how does my garbage, from smack dab in the middle of Canada, end up in the ocean contributing to the garage island, etc. I was told it doesn't. That is probably true. How could it get there by something I physically did? It just goes to the landfill and gets covered up by dirt as it gets too deep. Which is awful and I hate. Does my plastic straw end up in a sea turtle's nose? Probably not mine. But someone's does.

I feel like, not only in this situation, but in many others, there is so little I can do as one person. And that causes me great anxiety. I want to fix it. When there are huge developing countries that are polluting the hell out of the earth around them, how can I personally stop the madness? I want to! We drive a hybrid to help out at least a little bit as well.

When we had our child we ended up using disposable diapers. It was a choice we made based on health reasons. But it hurt! I know how long it takes for those to decompose (depending on the brand, essentially never). Now we are looking at having a second, and I am greatly anxious about using those diapers again. 

Will we need a car bigger than our current hybird? Yep. Most likely. Can we afford another hybrid of the same/different brand? Nope. And not driving is simply not an option where I live. Cannot be done. We measure distance between cities and towns in hours. To get to work, the doctor, etc. you need to drive. Intercity bus routes have all been cancelled. Companies folded or pulled out. No public transit in our city - only taxis.

I sometimes worry that my children will be left in an uninhabitable world after I'm gone. But that isn't stopping me, in the end, from having another. Who knows if the child I have will be the one to turn this thing around? It's not likely, but you never know! Also, with having children, sometimes the desire can cause madness if it is strong enough and not at least attempted. I know. Again, health reasons put it off this long.

I wish there was more clarity and assistance with what to do on a personal level. I visited family in Germany and they had at least 5 different bins in their apartment for recycling every known thing on earth. I wish! But we don't give that kind of effort the means to be practical and successful here.
