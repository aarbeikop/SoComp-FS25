>The amount of energy represented by this anomaly is equivalent to 4.2 million Terawatt hours of energy

This is incorrect. I did a more rigorous calculation last night, and I came up with the number of 600 Terawatt Hours to describe the +3C difference between this Kelvin wave and the usual ones (keeping the volume numbers the same). That's still a lot of energy, but it's not enough to ""hide"" the AGW. I did another calculation of just the Arctic amplification, assuming that the 1.4 Million km2 of ice loss persists for 1 month in the summer, and I got 4,000 terawatt hours. Seeing as how the arctic amplification is spread across both the Atlantic and Pacific, it seems that most of this extra heat could be provided by the sea ice loss amplification alone. To me this all makes sense and fits with Mr. Scribblers more detailed supercomputer analysis. The Arctic water heats up a lot more than normal, makes its way down the california coast (killing the fish and causing sickness in the sea lions along the way while it sinks), and then re-emerging in the equatorial zone, contributing to the el nino and causing bigger typhoons. By the way, 600 Terawatt hours is enough kinetic energy to create 3 additional Cat5 typhoons. An average typhoon will have about 1 Terawatt of power, and a Cat5 about 5. If I'm right, we'll have more typhoons in the western pacific. Last week we had a record breaker - strongest early typhoon ever in March. I just looked this morning, and 2 more formed in the last 2 days, adding to the record breaker Maysak.

When a typhoon forms and spins up, it's converting the thermal energy in the ocean directly into kinetic energy. It's phenomenal to watch these happen nowadays, sometimes growing from Cat1 - Cat5 in just 24 hours. Do you realize that is the same rate of power consumption as the entire US electricity grid?

Now, I have a lot of friends in the Philippines, and they just spent their Easter Sunday defending themselves from a deadly typhoon for the first time in their lives on this holiday - the typhoons are not supposed to come this early, and now their likely to see them stacked up, slamming into the country every couple weeks for the rest of the year. I hate it when people have the audacity and self centeredness to say that it's all BS. It isn't. Climate change is real and it affects people and animals severely every day and it's getting worse.

Because the suspected impacts of such an event are not manifesting themselves... at least not negatively.

Infact, if the manifestations we see are the result of them... Then we will see more exceptionally stable weather world wide. (IE hurricanes)","2015-04-05 06:58:48","3","FireFoxG","1747748841.237443","climate anxiety","manual"
