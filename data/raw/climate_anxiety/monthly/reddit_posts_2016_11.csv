"5cm60x","environment","emotional","Myron Ebell. What do we know? Hidden political agenda?","I'm curious to know more about Myron Ebell. There is a lot of anxiety regarding his appointment, but I sense that there is a political battle going on that no one is paying attention to.

The Clintons, if you've been aware of the FBI releases, the wikileaks (Stratfor and Podesta emails), DC leaks, and Clinton Cash have all recently exposed a vast criminal enterprise that sells political power for money. It seems to operate as a circle of blackmail and bribery that involves utilizing the media to exploit implicit bias and confirmation bias in people. Soros describes one tactic as 'othering.'

Myron Ebell sued some of these entities, put into power by the Clintons, because of poor standards of research to justify climate change. He may be a 'denier', and I would like to know opinions on that, but he could also just be a victim of 'othering' by Soros.

What seems clear is that Trump is interested in putting people in power that are going to work against the Clinton criminal enterprise. Considering their crimes, I am cautiously optimistic there will be some justice.

Given the Clinton tainted organizations are being backed by the same man who is paying people to riot, I am super skeptical of the agenda implemented in these entities that originated from the Clintons.

Now, I also feel that the Bush Initiative is an earlier version of the Clinton Foundation, which are both clones of the American Security Council Foundation. I am inclined to be distrustful of all these entities.

My initial conclusion is that none of these people are actually interested in the environment and that this is a deeper political game aimed at taking down the Clintons.

Still, what do we know about Ebell's stance? You aren unlikely to convince me that Soros and the Clinton money laundering ring were really looking out for the best interest of the environment. 

>In 2000, Ebell was a plaintiff, along with several members of Congress, including Sen. James Inhofe (R, OK), who sued the National Science and Technology Council, President Bill Clinton, and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs asserted that the National Assessment on Climate Change report—which details likely state-by-state consequences of anthropogenic climate change—violated several federal open-meeting, appropriations and research statutes.

Help me learn.

"5fiut4","environment","emotional","How can I deal with the fear of climate change?","Hello r/environment! I’m about to sound like a paranoid lunatic (hence the throwaway), but I have an ongoing problem where I feel totally overwhelmed and afraid when I think about climate change. I do things in my life to try and make a small impact to help – I recycle as much as possible, I’m cutting back on eating meat, I’m trying to reduce my waste and water usage – but no matter what I do in my life, the fossil fuel industry is still ravaging the planet. And they have no intention of stopping. To top it off, my country just elected an idiotic, climate-change-denier as our next President! Not that I think Clinton would have done much to help either, but at least she doesn’t refer to climate change as a “hoax” started by China.  

I try to think about the future, even 10 years from now, and I have no idea what the world will be like. I hope that we’ll pull our shit together and start working hard to fix this, but I don’t want to hope and be wrong, so I’m trying to prepare myself for the worst possible scenario. I feel like the life I’m living now won’t be around in 10 years. When will food and fresh water become scarce? When will we lose Louisiana and Florida? I’ve always wanted to have kids, but I don’t want to anymore because I don’t want to bring children (who didn’t ask to be born) into a world that holds no opportunity for them. I think about the things that I’m working toward in my life now and when I think about the future, I suddenly think, “What’s the point?” 

I’m going through my daily life and I’m happy, but I have this giant, heavy cloud hanging over my head. I’ve been reading articles that show the devastating effects that climate change is already having on our planet, and it’s going to get worse before it gets better, if it ever does. What if we do finally get our shit together and it’s too late? 

Before you ask or suggest, yes, I’m in therapy for anxiety, but this is one of those issues where it feels like no matter how relaxed I may feel in therapy, this shit is still happening. Just because I feel a little better about it doesn’t mean that anything is going to change. I can go to therapy and feel better afterward but Trump is still becoming our next President and is threatening to break apart the EPA and is filling his cabinet with ultra-conservative climate-change-deniers. 

Does anyone see any hope for our planet? Has anyone else been feeling like this? How do you deal with it? 

TLDR: I’ve been really scared lately of climate change/future for our planet. Does anyone see any hope? Does anyone else feel this way? How do you deal with it?
