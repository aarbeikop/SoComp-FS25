>If we're headed for a population bottleneck because of overshoot due to fossil fuel usage, then we're about to experience unimaginable horrors. We here in the first world are watching as the rest of the world descends into the easily-predictable chaos that comes with a sudden loss of habitable environment. We can see it getting worse, and we know it's coming for us.

>We can deny it, and many of us are. The denial takes many forms, from flat climate change denial to facile beliefs in ludicrous technologies. Our cinematic faith in someone coming along to save humanity takes many forms. You can stay pretty sane and functional this way as long as your ability to avoid processing information holds out.

>Others abandon compassion. When faced with the unimaginable horror that's arriving, the deaths of thousands of innocents, and the fact that it's just the beginning, we realize that we don't have the emotional capacity to cope. If we can somehow deny that each of the faces we see on the news are human beings, with stories, loved ones, children, hope, then we don't have to deal with the emotional impact of them dying at all.

>Those of us who are unable to suppress the gibbering horror which the end of civilization engenders tend to be the people who haven't bought into the foundations of trust that lie at the heart of civilization. We don't have faith that everything turns out all right, or in authority figures, or saviors. From a psychological perspective, that's unhealthy.

>The consequences of the anxiety that comes with an understanding of the world are devastating. Stress kills, any doctor or psychiatrist or social worker will tell you that. Our bodies aren't built for it, we can develop anything from asthma and Alzheimer's to severe autoimmune disorders.

>Given the state of the planet, psychology has become more and more about finding ways to be okay with what's going on around us, learning techniques to quell our fears and our doubts so we can get on with our days. So we're taught how to deal with troublesome thoughts, through meditation and mental techniques, and we're taught how to let out our emotions. We're given drugs to take the edge off. And we're told to look away from the world when we need to. To take care of ourselves. We're told that it's okay to turn the news off. That the world will go on if we're not looking.

>Put your own oxygen mask on first before helping the other passengers, right? You've got to take care of yourself before you can take care of the world. But if taking care of yourself means minimizing the issues facing humanity, avoiding the true emotional impact of what's about to happen, and everyone's taking care of themselves, then... well, you get the exact situation we're in now.

>A lot of people insisting there's no danger at all, despite the fact that thousands are already dying. A lot of heartless assholes jeering as people die. A lot of emotionally disturbed people screaming about people dying.

>And a whole bunch of people heading straight for the edge of a cliff in a healthy, well-adjusted way.

I wrote that a couple of years ago, and I think it encapsulates what you've encountered, but doesn't answer your question very well. The problem is, this goes against the very tenets of psychology, which put the well being of the individual first. As a mental health professional, for instance, you can't counsel your client not to have children for the good of the planet, when you know that it would be great for them personally. You can't tell your clients with money problems to give up their cars, or your successful ones to give up flying, to the detriment of their careers.

But those are futile gestures at this point anyway, so it's pretty moot.

Personally, I've been encouraging people to start banding together to build habitats that'll survive the Earth's transformation into an alien, uninhabitable environment. I think it's come down to survival of the species now, and getting any human beings through this bottleneck is going to require a ton of research, an unimaginable amount of work, and enormous personal sacrifices.

Your clients are faced with a tragedy on an entirely unanticipated scale. If you want to help them, either find real, actual hope you can give them, or just validate and listen to their fears. Maybe look into how to counsel terminal patients, and apply some of that knowledge to your clients in general. Be open to ideas like LSD or MDMA therapy when they become legally available.

He's a controversial figure around here, but Guy McPherson is approaching this from a grief counseling perspective; from what I can tell, he's the only person working in this field as of yet.

Because it's grief counseling, but we're grieving a planet. Nobody knows how to do this right. I'm glad you're trying. Listen, study, make mistakes, make amends, and when you figure out something that works, spread it around, would you? We could all use some help with this.","2019-04-30 06:00:11","23","MrVisible","1747788750.560655","climate anxiety","manual"
"em4aspg","t3_biyend","biyend","collapse","skeptical","I think many answers are in philosophy. From the begining greeks, indians and chinese thinkers are questioning about the meaning of life and suffering. Maybe you can dimiss that thinking ""But now we REALLY know that we are fucked"", but for example the ideas of Confucius born in an epoch of war and decadence, when armies destroyed cities and fed the survivors with soup of their families. That is fucked. I think many mental problems in our times are a problem of values, because when you see that your sadness or angst comes from the competitive mindset of society then you can liberate from that. Collapse is just the last phase of our society in the grand scheme of things therefore we are not different from the last mayans or last romans. Maybe the shock in our lifestyle will be enormous, but that kind of shocks are a ""normal event"" historically speaking. For example my parents lived from a democracy to a dictatorship and many people died just because: people who didnt adapt inmediatly to the new curfrew, people who didnt follow simple orders, people who by indirect association with a comunist neighborn or family member. My uncles brother was killed just for too early go for bread, literally nothing more. And that is pretty fucked, but in the grand scheme of things that events are expected in anyone lifetime.

"em4wuu3","t3_biyend","biyend","collapse","skeptical","My solution will only apply to relatively few people. I mention it because psychology is not well-equipped to deal with a lot of existential philosophy, but if you ever encounter people like me, understand that the human species and existence more generally forced these conclusions upon us. These conclusions are the rational consequence of having certain values.

I told a therapist yesterday that I had come to existential terms with existence and the human species. I said that the things I value - love, beauty, and so on make communities stronger, but our communities are plugged into suicidal modes of existence that we can never escape because it's impossible to escape the shackles of the terrible people who ""control"" the world (of course, this species has no control whatsoever).

As such -  by being good I will assist in ""good"" and ""evil"" self-annihilating - though I don't believe in those terms as actual forces - just categories of behaviors and emotions. Stronger communities mean a more ""well-oiled machine"" - hence more global entropy and wealth for the ""ruling"" parasites, which gives them more ""power"", etc. Assisting this species' self-destruction is what I want because humans are an abomination.

Then evolution has a chance to evolve actual intelligence on Earth - an enlightened species. And if it doesn't happen here, the Universe is yet vast. However, it might not be possible for the Universe to evolve such a species (e.g. higher intelligence probably only evolves in predator species, and this might preclude the possibility of enlightenment). We'll never know, but it's the only positive existential possibility worth considering.

If it's not possible, that means all of existence is an abomination - a disturbing state of affairs. Still, helping the human ape destroy itself at least reduces the Universe's own suffering a minimal amount (e.g. factory farm animals, ocean whales exposed to machine noise, billions of suffering humans, etc.)

She said she had similar thoughts herself. The point is to understand and accept such people if you come across us.

And keep in mind that the point of mental health, as it exists, is to keep people plugged into civilization's suicide machine. As such - you might want to consider my reasoning yourself.","2019-04-30 13:28:53","5","AArgot","1747788750.570459","climate anxiety","manual"
"em6groj","t3_biyend","biyend","collapse","skeptical","It's been about ~20 years since I first started dwelling on this topic, when a relative who worked for a major oil company explained to me that peak oil was coming, and what that meant, and I got into researching this topic, including Orlov's blog when it first came out. 

I've gone through all the five stages of grief over the years, bouncing back and forth between stages at times. During the bargaining phase the hubby and I reduced our carbon footprint and strategized about how we'd survive TEOTWAWKI. Oh what plans we made! Today we realize they are all pretty foolish, might help for a bit, but not for long. 

Then I hit a long period of depression and during that time I realized it was an existential crisis so began researching philosophy and spirituality. Many different influences there as I spent about 10 years exploring. What helped my mindset the most was probably non-dualism. A concept that is hard for me to put into words, so I'll share someone else's:

http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/writings/what-is-nonduality/

I also found comfort in this idea of Bostrom's simulated reality. We are in a simulation. As well as the concept of parallel realities. Yes we are in the worst timeline, but that doesn't mean it ends with this.

But also this thought stuck in my mind (based in the concept of ""reincarnation"" I suppose) that somehow I chose to be here, for this collapse. We *all* chose to be here for this. We all contributed to this. Does that make us ""bad"" people? No. There is no good and no bad, there just is. It's the drama playing on the movie screen, entertaining the formless eternal. Once this world is over, that drama will play on elsewhere. In the meantime, embrace you character -- whether antagonist or protagonist. 

Some may say that's magical thinking but it comforts me to view the situation this way, a situation I have no control over. Well, the only thing I can control is my reaction to it. Hubby and I have suicide plans if the cannibals come to our door -- I am not about to commit suicide now because I want to see how collapse goes down, but yes, I can possibly control the timing of my death. If not, I can control how I face it.

That said I am also older (mid-50s) so existential thoughts are a matter of fact, as my friends and parents die and I contemplate my own inevitable death. That's one thing all of us humans have in common. We all die eventually. 

I like that you aren't about to dismiss or minimize your patient's fears. I'd probe with them what else may be going on in their lives, as the stages I went through also paralleled some more mundane typical-life stressor stuff. And sometimes it really did help to just ""be here now"" and throw myself into life without thinking too hard about all of this.","2019-04-30 23:02:09","4","temp4adhd","1747788750.57343","climate anxiety","manual"

This sounds promising.  Make some really good art.  I will enjoy it even if you do not.  Some really good art has cataclysmic scenes.  Check out some of [Frida Kahlo's art](http://www.amybrown.net/women/frida.html).  [This one](http://www.amybrown.net/women/two_fridas.jpg) is probably the most depressing thing I have ever seen.  Notice that she is holding her own hand and is trying to stop the hemorrhaging blood.

You can study some history.  We should rejoice because we were not born in the hell that was our past.  Yes collapse will be bad *when* it happens.  It has not collapsed yet.

Some carpenter bees moved in behind my house this year.  They look pretty healthy.  You can plant pollinator flowers.  The insects or humming birds that find your garden will appreciate it.  Look at the banner at the top of the collapse reddit page.  Add some bright flowers to that image.  There will be some future whether or not we are in it.

1. Agent Smith was right; the life-form we most resemble is a virus. 

2. Similarly, a data analyst from Google compared people and their data habits to insect swarms.

3. I became disabled and realized just how much is and is not within my ability to control, and along with that how much was never in my control. 

4. We all want to be The Onion Knight, or Jon Snow, or some other person who can at least pretend to have a  better sense than others as to just what the fuck is happening in the world. In reality, we are all just Hot Pie.

5. Some people believe they are in charge when the truth is no one is really in charge.

I came to the same conclusion as you, OP: all I can do is enjoy my time, and my time with my kids, as much as possible. Their lives will be different than mine. Maybe they will survive. Maybe they will thrive in a competitive hellscape; maybe they will die. Maybe humans will thrive; maybe environmental disaster will spark humanity to greater achievements, or maybe we will be wiped out like the 90+% of all species that have ever existed.

Whatever the destiny of humans, the universe is incomprehensible in its size and scale, and we are indeed as a virus in a Petri dish. Less than.
