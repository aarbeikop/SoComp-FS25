"beqk50","climate","scientific","Climate change anxiety","I have generalised anxiety disorder and it’s safe to say climate change affects me hugely. Any tips on how to deal with it?

I’m already doing what I can in my life, I’ve gone vegan and I’m always trying to reduce my waste. 

Something this big and largely out of my control just feels too overwhelming :(","2019-04-18 20:50:08","1","10","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/beqk50/climate_change_anxiety/","True","namelesssfaceless","1747788550.800652","climate anxiety","manual"
"biyend","collapse","skeptical","As a mental healthcare professional how do I approach valid anxiety and depression due to climate change?","I do a lot of work related to mental healthcare. I'm not a frontline worker most of the time; I mostly focus on creating defining and explaining best practices for those who are. I'll also be getting into teaching and working with younger children in the next few years.

I'm also a long time member of this sub. I've written a few articles about the coming extinction and anthropogenic climate change, which is essentially tantamount to mass suicide/homicide.

One thing I'm having trouble with is dealing with ""climate anxiety"" and depression on an individual basis. I'm at odds with a lot of my colleagues as I would consider ""climate anxiety"" unique from most other anxieties, as it's predicted upon something completely rational that has/will inflict very real harm on individuals. With depression, it's not as simple as saying ""things will get better"" because chances are, they wont.

I feel it's my professional and human duty to prepare those under my guidance for this, and part of that is acknowledging the anxiety and depression a lot of folks feel is in fact the rational response - healthy in a sense - for the opposite would be engaging in denial. But o can't just leave people like this. I owe it to them to do better, so how can I? How do you navigate and accept depression/anxiety over these issues? What helps alleviate those feelings? Is hope - even if futile - a responsible thing to promote? 

As a professional, I feel caught; either our mental health suffers, or our planet suffers. That's a pretty untenable position to hold among my colleagues, but I feel they're no better than the worst polluters by treating climate-related anxiety and depression as anything more than just another little mental health quibble to get over. I'd appreciate some input and additional perspectives on this.","2019-04-30 03:02:46","60","45","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/biyend/as_a_mental_healthcare_professional_how_do_i/","True","BlPlN","1747788749.739549","climate anxiety","manual"
"bbduvm","collapse","skeptical","Anxiety, Annihilation, and You: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Collapse","The Collapse is inevitable and no one is doing anything about it, right? You know the solution, the answer to our problems that would turn it all around, if only people would just listen! Sustainable lifestyles, Geoengineering, better food distribution, Communist uprising, going green in '19, *not buying a new damn cell phone when a used one is just as good and the heavy metals involved are* blah blah blah...

News flash buddy, **it isn't going to happen**. I'm sorry, I wish it wasn't true, but it is. We've all seen the headlines, read the news articles. It's out of our hands now. The corporations and governments of the world are the ones who started this thing, and they're the only ones able to stop it, let alone turn it around. We all know the likelihood of that happening. 

This makes you anxious. Scared. Depressed. Suicidal even. If the end of the world is inevitable, why even bother, right? Stop. Take a second. Relax. Breathe. Even the most pessimistic projections give us a decade, and most scientists agree it's going to be 20 or so years before things get really bad.

Look, competing with each other over who can make the biggest drop in the bucket isn't doing anyone any good. You can't save the world by recycling and going vegan, and no CEO or politician would ever care to hear what you have to say, but you can still save yourselves. Anxiety and depression both stem from the same source: **Hopelessness**. A feeling of being unable to make a change or difference. Anxiety and depression are gifts from mother nature. Evolution has given us this primal fear, this deep-seated unsettling discomfort when faced with an issue. You just have to turn it into action. 

We're in a unique situation on this subreddit because we know what's coming. We've opened our eyes. When Miami is sinking, when LA is engulfed in fire, when a hurricane is knocking on the gates of the NYC sea wall, it will be far too late to act. So act now. Acquire skills while you still can. 

* You're a scared 18 year old who wonders why college matters anymore, or you're worried that you'll be left with a useless degree? Become a nurse, a doctor, an EMT. Go into the trades; carpentry, HVAC, electrical. Become a Water Resource Engineer. Get your degree in Sustainable Agriculture. Become a climate scientist yourself. I guarantee you the jobs I just mentioned will only become more valuable when shit gets hot.

* You already have a job or a career? Buy cheap land while the getting is good. Learn how to grow and preserve food there, or what animals are native and how to track them. Best case scenario: science was wrong and the climate doesn't get too bad, or maybe against all odds humanity pulls together and saves the planet. Now you have a nice ranch home in Colorado, or a nifty hunting cabin in Michigan. Worst case scenario: things get as bad as they say it will, and now you're way ahead of the people waiting in line for water in New Mexico. 

* *At the very least* start stockpiling food and water. Even just setting aside a few dollars for extra rice and beans every month or another gallon of water puts you in a much better position when things start going downhill. When you're better situated, acquire more skills. Learn to fix your car. Buy a gun. Take a survival course, or a martial arts class. Start a garden. You don't need to go full doomsday prepper here. Most of this shit could fit right into a normal persons' life. You just happen to have some perspective about the whole thing.

The point is to prepare. **Act**. Do something, *anything*, to improve your position, because sitting on reddit reading about how shit things are is not doing wonders for your mental or physical health. Use that anxiety, that fear, and turn it into a productive force. I promise you that even baby-steps towards progress will go a long way towards feeling better.

And for those of you that say there's no point, or that they don't want to live in a world where things are as bad as science is saying it can get? I promise you that you're wrong. The human drive to survive is powerful, so powerful in fact that I can practically guarantee you that you will still be hanging around with us when the SHTF. The question is do you want to be sitting in a refugee center in Phoenix, or dying of heatstroke in Houston? Or do you want to prepare now and be working your quiet farm in Oregon, hearing about these things over the radio? 

If you read this whole thing, thank you. I hope I can inspire even one person to act, or to be less anxious at the least. If I do, I'll be glad I wrote it. 

TLDR: Doom and gloom isn't helping anyone, you can't change anything, but you can act to improve your own circumstances.

Edit: Slight changes to grammar and spelling.

Edit 2: Thank you to whoever gave me gold! I'm glad my post was able to make such an impact on you.

Edit 3: Thank you for the silver as well!","2019-04-09 21:47:10","127","93","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bbduvm/anxiety_annihilation_and_you_or_how_i_learned_to/","True","Cimbri","1747788921.447167","climate anxiety","manual"
"bgp6qf","collapse","skeptical","Why am I still going","My whole life has been me trying to find happiness (a quick look through my history can confirm that), depression, loneliness, self loathing, and failures have been consitante companions of mine. What got me through the dark moments of yesterday was hope of a better life when I got older

But here I am looking at the uncaring truth. The Earth is dying, a Blue Ocean event is only a couple of years away, bees are going extinct, and the effects of ecological collapse and climate change will only compound and worsen exponentially. I feel hopeless for, and betrayed by everything. What use will a career in Animation, political science, Biotechnology, or some random STEM subject have in the hell that will be our future? Why did I have to be born right before The Great Filter of the Fermi Parodox is about to strikes us down!? Why did I have to be born with aspergers and ADHD, and face the ensuing depression and anxiety from those genetic conditions right before the Blue Ocean event? Any time that could have been avalible for me to make myself a better person, who is deserving of happiness?

All those dreams I had, fueled by the countless moments where I whispered that accursed phrase, that phrase that originated from therapists, teachers, caseworkers, and other peddlers of false hope. The phrase of ""It gets better"", is what I told myself for when I needed to get through yesterday. But now, I see reality, and as much I fantasize about the denialists being right, despite the tears forming in the bottom of my eyes, despite the urge to hope some Deus Ex Machina will save us all, I have to accept it.

This was not the future promised to that strange 10 year old, or the lonely 12 year old, or the suicidal 15 year old. I see the truth behind that cruel facade of promise. Everything is getting worse, and there is nothing that is keeping me going. 

By now dear reader, you are filled with concern for my wellbeing. By now you have scrolled to the bottom to comment a link or phone number to some suicide help line. Or perhaps offer some platitude that may inspire some motivation for me to fall into another pipedream. Then there is the possibility you're one is as much of a ""realist"" as I am, and maybe you're going to say something about enjoying things while they are still here. 
That's not going to keep me from ending my pathetic life. What will keep me alive is the simple, yet powerful primal urge of fear. As an accidental overdose last year has taught me just how far I am willing to go, just to avoids death. It's the true reason why I haven't opened up my wrists, and why 40 years from now I will be scavenging the remains of the promised life.

So to tldr, this isn't a suicide note

That is my future, and I am too weak to avoids","2019-04-24 02:29:17","5","33","0.61","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bgp6qf/why_am_i_still_going/","True","Cxxz32","1747788992.7136781","climate anxiety","manual"
"bagw67","collapse","skeptical","Taking time away from the collapse sub is imperative for intellectual and emotional stability...","So I was a frequent visitor and contributor to this sub for a couple of years and have avidly kept up with the state of climate change and geopolitics for years before that.  This research has led me to the same conclusion as most of you, that the collapse of our society (and most likely the extinction of humanity) is all but foregone at this point and we are at the stage when we must strive to prepare for the changes that will occur in the next few decades.  That said, I have a 9 year old son that was born a few years before I really started to comprehend just how far down the path to oblivion we have traveled.  I am constantly scared for him and his future and, at times, regret the fact that I brought him into a world that is most likely doomed to destruction and an adulthood that is destined to consist of nothing but a struggle to merely survive through to the next day.  Eventually it got so bad that I realized I was having trouble finding any joy in my current life and that my fears and anxieties had bled into nearly every action and conversation.  I couldn’t stop myself from constantly thinking about the myriad problems that are only getting worse by the day or the inability of countries and leaders to comprehend the true nature of the dangers we face, My knowledge pushing me into a dark and dangerous place.  It was at this point that I decided I needed to step away from not just the collapse sub, but from actively seeking out every bit of collapse related news I could find.  I made a conscious choice to ignore what I already knew and discovered that the more time I let pass, the better my mental and emotional state became.  In truth, I know that I am merely tricking myself and that my refusal to stay abreast of the changes that took place over my 6 month disconnect from the sub and other collapse related news (not all, since that’s impossible, but most of it, as big media is nothing if not optimistic about our ability to solve any problem) has only served to create an artificial barrier between my knowledge and reality, but ultimately, it has been enough to enable me to appreciate life as it is RIGHT NOW.  The truth is, no one knows what the future holds for certain, but the facts point in one direction and that is the end of society as we know it and, quite possibly, our species as well.  So the only thing we can do is live for today and prepare for the future the best we can.  Unfortunately, spending too much time on this topic seems to lead to depression and a sort of paralysis that keeps you from focusing on anything but the topic of the collapse of our world.  So my advice to everyone who is teetering on the edge...take time away from the sub and the horrific news that comes out every day, at least to the best of your ability.  Spend time among those you love and care for, participate in activities you enjoy and, above all, do not give up.  Even a life destined for difficulty can find meaning and joy, sometimes to do so you have to ignore the future and focus on what’s right in front of you.  Stay positive my fellow collapsers and however much time we might have left...make the most of it.

Tldr - spending too much time focused on collapse based news can negatively impact your intellectual and emotional state.  Disconnecting from this news for a time can help you return to a more rational mindset and allow you to enjoy life again.","2019-04-07 14:41:30","69","13","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bagw67/taking_time_away_from_the_collapse_sub_is/","True","drwsgreatest","1747789008.167186","climate anxiety","manual"
