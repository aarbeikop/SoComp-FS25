"c4skjl","climatechange","action-oriented","Journalist writing about climate anxiety","Hi all, 

I'm a journalist with Kaiser Health News and I'm writing a story about climate change anxiety (spurred in part by last night's Big Little Lies episode). I am looking for someone who would be willing to talk to me about their anxiety-inducing thoughts or feelings about climate change for the article - your real name would need to be used. I'm trying to make this somewhat of a self-help article where I ask therapists about what can be done to actually alleviate anxiety about this topic. I've seen a lot of posts on this subreddit about these types of anxious thoughts and I know a lot of us (me included) are feeling these types of overwhelming doom feelings about the climate right now and I hope this article will spread the word/help in some way. If you would be willing to talk to me about this, please respond to this post or message me. Thanks! -Victoria","2019-06-24 18:04:29","33","7","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/c4skjl/journalist_writing_about_climate_anxiety/","True","vrknight100","1747790001.1325529","climate anxiety","manual"

"bwlpz9","collapse","skeptical","The stampede anxiety of the elites—clampdown on information related to collapse and climate change"," 

Information is power as they say. Ever more so in times such as war or the continuing climate tragedy we now seem to be in the midst of. So it seems to reason then that the hoarding and tight dissemination of information related to surviving will, therefore, be increasingly incentivized. 

Where to move your family? Where will there be food security? Where will there be water? Where will the weather not kill me or my loved ones? Where can I migrate to if I need to? These are all natural questions that arise for anyone who has wrestled with the thoughts and feelings related to the issues raised in this forum, and we see posts with these questions all the time. 

The people here are very supportive of one another for the most part and freely share insights and information related to these questions on a daily basis. For myself personally, it is one of the things that makes this such a healthy community; in spite of all the bad news. Although as the majority of the population becomes well aware of the severity of the situation—it is likely that information related to survival will be worth more than gold. Literally. I don't think this is lost on those with money and power in this society. 

Much has been written about the sociopathic tendencies of those drawn to wealth and power:

> ...the driving force with sociopaths (and they have lots of energy) is to dominate others. This may or may not involve breaking the law. They want to dominate people in order to get things from them, such as their possessions, money, sex, business partners, homes, cars, investments, reputation and so forth. But they also like dominating others just for the feeling of it—the feeling of power and control.

Many elites are not likely to settle for answers such as  ""There is no place to hide!"" when they have such vast means at their disposal. Through this lens, it's an easy calculation to see that as conditions worsen, and money loses its status—information, as it relates to survival, will be priceless and the self-interested in the extreme are likely to want to restrict access to that information. Just as sociopaths have worked so hard at dominating money as a means to survival success so too are they likey to work just as hard in this. 

Although there's been a lot of speculation about why the media ignores the issue of climate change related weather catastrophes, I believe that we are at the point now, or soon enough, where information hoarding incentives are going to kick in and this could very well be why we are seeing a lack of coverage already. 

It's probable that Internet and web sources have been the primary source of climate change information for most people. Mainly due to the lack of mainstream media coverage of the issue—the weekly observations post pinned to the top of this forum is a testament to this climate change information desert. Although this is likely to change as conditions worsen and information restriction incentives arise. Pressure will be brought to bear on the big tech companies to comply with information flow changes to bring them into conformity with more mainstream news narratives. In fact, it may very well be as to why we are now seeing regulation threats against ""Big Tech"" (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, etc.)

To the point—I felt compelled to post this because I think it's important to understand and process this in a public way as these thoughts were rather revelatory for myself. Granted there may be those out there that have already come to some of these understandings. But I had never really walked through some of these thoughts about how the things we take for granted today may fall down and how deeply motivations may change. Hence it's easy to see that, as the situation worsens, the incentives will be all the stronger to lock down how much we really see of the world we aren't experiencing ourselves firsthand. 

How do you stop mass migrations from starting? Humanely?—as if that's possible. You tell them every other place is worse. You restrict their access to information on conditions elsewhere. How do you stop people from engaging in an ill-informed land grab on parts of the world nearer the poles? You restrict information. And on and on; for as long as possible. So that demand is falsely suppressed for all things related to survival scenarios in order to gain the first-mover advantage—however deluded and sociopathic that may be. ","2019-06-04 06:57:03","80","11","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bwlpz9/the_stampede_anxiety_of_the_elitesclampdown_on/","True","AllenIll","1747790370.8000278","climate anxiety","manual"
"c04qgv","collapse","skeptical","The conservative paradox - parents must be selfish to protect their children but selfishness will destroy the world in which their children live","I had dinner with an old friend of mine. I hadn't seen him in years. When I knew him, he was a single man, just like me. However, he updated me on his life, telling me that since he last met me he had gotten married and now had a baby.

He asked me if I was dating and when I was having a child and seemed disappointed that I was doing neither. I told him that I had no issue with getting a girlfriend or wife but I didn't want children because I think climate change will destroy the world. 

My friend then seemed to take offense to this. He claimed that he didn't care about climate change. He told me he was getting tired of his job and just wanted to ""get rich quick"" because he had a baby now that he needed to take care of. He claimed that he had very high expenses and needed to make a lot of money. This naked greed was surprising because it was completely different to how he was when he was younger. 

When extreme greed and desperation takes over someone, they seem to not only disregard the greater good but seem to revel in disregarding it, almost as if they resent the responsibly of looking after a child so much and take it out on the innocent, saying ""look what my child has made me do!""

On the train back home from the city, I thought about conservatism and how many conservatives have this view ie they embrace selfishness and disregard of the environment. It is a generalisation but the left side of policies  tries to protect the poor and vulnerable whether it is low income earners or the environment or marginalised groups. Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that the poor and vulnerable should not be protected and that they should just be left alone and expected to compete or otherwise be oppressed. 

However, conservative policy makes the world a bad place. More and more liberalisation of markets have generated a very unstable labor market that fills workers with anxiety. Conservative policy is also bad for the environment. There will be extreme climate events by 2050 and by 2100 there will likely be climate apocalypse due to conservative policy. Basically conservative policy has made people meaner and has destroyed the world.

The paradox is that conservatives are highly natalist. They promote breeding and fertility. The problem is that having children makes no sense in a world they have destroyed, a world filled with economic instability as well as the existential risk of climate change. Why spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a child if the child will just die from climate apocalypse?

Furthermore, the cost of children forces parents to become greedy and selfish. However, being greedy and selfish makes the world a bad place, which destroys the world and therefore harms their children. What point is there is having a child only to expose them to a mean, selfish world that is destroyed by climate change? 

Parents feel compelled to be selfish to protect their children, but their selfishness will destroy the world in which their children live, which means having children was pointless.","2019-06-13 11:38:46","126","86","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c04qgv/the_conservative_paradox_parents_must_be_selfish/","True","hmgEqualWeather","1747790544.7102778","climate anxiety","manual"

This is the shit I live with every day. That horrible anxiety of that something horrible is just... right there, it's going to happen, but everyone just fucking refuses to listen. And even if they did, like that bar room scene in episode 2, there's no point telling them. Let them be happy, why cause a panic, but fuck swallowing it down is so hard.
