"cpqorq","climatechange","action-oriented","Are scientists just trying to keep us hopeful?","I see articles about scientists telling us how bad things are, but they're peppered with ""but there's hope!"" statements followed by what we can do to lower emissions, giving us the idea that if we lower emissions the Earth will cool itself or return to safe levels of atmospheric CO2. I see them proclaiming ""scary"" studies where if we don't do something 10 or 12 years from now, we'll see this echosystem being damaged or that irreversible effect. 10 years from now seems, to me, the perfect number to pick where it gets people's attention but just distant enough that we feel hopeful. A lot can happen in 10 years, right? Well, yes, but with the amount of CO2 already in the atmosphere it's not stopping the train just keeping it from speeding up more. No matter what year it is there's always some OTHER irreversible damage 10 years from then that they'll want us focusing on.

I think 10 years from now scientists will give us ANOTHER 10 years to reduce emissions; not because we can fix the Earth, but because we probably can't and we just want to delay catastrophic temperature increases as much as possible, without causing a panic.

And if that's the case, is it time we accept that we are living in the peak of humanity's existence? As the climate gets worse and worse, will we have to start thinking about how to calm people's climate anxiety? I think at some point in the future we may realize that our own fears about climate change are all that's left for us to control.","2019-08-13 09:24:29","2","14","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cpqorq/are_scientists_just_trying_to_keep_us_hopeful/","True","Blasco1993","1747791706.755612","climate anxiety","manual"

In response to an article entitled ""[Climate feedback loops could put human civilization on the road to extinction](https://www.straight.com/news/1284161/climate-feedback-loops-could-put-human-civilization-road-extinction)"", reader Arthur Ralfs makes the following interesting comment:

>*Since we're talking about feedback loops, here's a technical note. From the point of view of applied mathematics, the climate looks like a huge nonlinear dynamical system. The study of nonlinear dynamics embraces phenomena such as chaos, fractals, and the Mandelbrot set. It's known for being very unintuitive. One general feature of such systems is abrupt change from one behavioral regime to another completely different one. In the popular psyche the term ""tipping point"" has gained traction, but this doesn't really capture it. In my mind's eye, the phrase tipping point conjures an image of a balance with two pans. If one starts to dip more than the other, weight can be transferred from one side to the other to restore balance. This is NOT typical behavior of nonlinear systems. Instead, think of walking down a slight incline with the surroundings changing slowly as we go down. At any time we could stop, turn around, and go back. Except at some point, we walk over a cliff. If we survive the fall, we find ourselves in totally different surroundings and with no easy way to go back. This aspect of climate has greatly disturbed me since the mid nineties when scientists came to a rough consensus about global warming. Once we go over the cliff, there is no way to go back and human civilization, in its present form, is probably over. It's possible it's already too late, that we've already gone over the cliff and we're in a state of free fall to another climate regime. Some famous scientists have argued this, for instance James Lovelock of Gaia fame was touring around a few years ago arguing this was the case and that we should worry more about preparing than preventing. Personally, I'm a little more optimistic than Professor Lovelock, but of course no one can predict the future with certainty.*

I would say we have already passed multiple points of no return and there is no end in sight for our roughly 30 to 40 gigatonnes of annual manmade CO2 emissions; they are inexorably rising and will continue to do so by the relentless degradation of natural carbon sinks. The article states:*""'Around 3°C, the Amazon starts to burn down,' Bradbrook noted in the Extinction Rebellion video. 'Forests become net carbon producers, not the sinks that they are today. And crops fail.'""*

**Forests have already become net carbon emitters according to recent research**:

I visited Yosemite National Park a few weeks ago and entered the park from the south entrance. The extent of dead and burnt forest from that entry point was a horrific site. Once inside Yosemite valley the beauty was breathtaking, but for how much longer before it too succumbs to climate disruption? According to satellite imagery, California has lost around 160 million trees in the past few years, undoubtedly exacerbated by a warming climate. The owner of a bed and breakfast outside of Oakhurst said the last couple years of forest fires have been devastating for the local economy. She said, ""You couldn't see 20 feet in front of you because of the forest fire smoke.""

**The global economy is burning greenhouse gasses ten times faster than volcanoes that sparked Earth’s greatest mass extinction, the Late Permian event.**([https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2681](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fngeo2681%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR30rUW2SKWRmHQAZhmrn9yBnAte9cInqvXTHW4LBXIn-C0N8llMFUsjaJo&h=AT0FOgQHoVOlXPFbU3xpBmZtk6mVZNr-93ju610THJHzgEatAEw3CNG9lF127_yBN7MPdIU4DVL-k5jIAMByJrNEaJNik-HAgMfYsQknPDgAc5W143nPGmUo9XRqpyrBgUzs6jEDIO0QoEdH0ly317wlKA))

Most of Earth’s mass extinctions were caused by a disruption in the carbon cycle which happened slowly over a much longer time span compared to today and without all the other human-forced pressures on the planet. All the technological advances and creature comforts we value today came at a rising environmental cost which is now impossible to repay since we have essentially ‘sold the farm’ in terms of the stability of the Holocene and the biochemistry of the planet.

We need to stop using prevaricating words like ""could' or ""may"" in terms of predictions because major changes are already happening decades sooner than have been foreseen. Only an emergency shutdown of all unnecessary economic activity and rapid decarbonization of society is going to stem future damage, much of which is already locked-in due to time lags between CO2 emissions and warming effects. Unfortunately, the inertia of our socio-economic system, our dependence on fossil fuels, and our hubris appear to be our undoing.
