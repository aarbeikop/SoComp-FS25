I'm in my mid-twenties, almost done with my masters degree and in a field that I've always wanted to work in, and four and a half years into a relationship with a woman I love. Yet here I am struggling to sleep at night because I worry that this is it, that humanity as a whole is looking down the barrel of a gun without even realizing it. I feel like there's more I want to say but it's just more of the same, stress and anxiety swirling constantly as I cant stop thinking about how this is all going to end up.","2018-08-23 00:05:29","11","31","0.76","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/99ijce/im_struggling_with_anxiety_related_to_climate/","True","WestReality","1747781899.9376588","climate anxiety","manual"
