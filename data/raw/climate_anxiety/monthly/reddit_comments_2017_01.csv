"dbv35ev","t3_5laam9","5laam9","climate","scientific","For what it's worth, I've had a very similar crisis recently (and I'm about your age) - I wrote down fifty reasons to be calm and posted it on /r/collapse (inevitable doom trolling in the comments - don't mind them, they're dealing with things in their own way, and despair is also just an emotion). https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5fyv44/50_reasons_to_be_calm/

My best guess of the future is much like yours: collapse is inevitable, extinction is not. An older friend (and long term environmentalist) reminded me to ""be humble in my predictions"" - so I prepare for the worst, while hoping for the less-bad.

P.S. Guy McPherson is the opposite of humble - and he's wrong, see e.g. https://fractalplanet.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/how-guy-mcpherson-gets-it-wrong/","2017-01-01 09:50:24","4","pterid","1747764299.6915112","climate anxiety","manual"

Please don't kill yourself. I'd much rather be amongst people genuinely concerned for the environment and economy.

But know too that the damage will be slow. Sea level will very likely rise less than 2m by 2100. And likely less than 1m.

Extinctions are certainly increasing, and that's tragic because it's irreversible.

But there won't be famine and fire descending around you, just an enduring economic depression, and increasing insurance costs.

Dude (I assume).. don't be, cut back on your emissions (have a goal of 2-3t per annum), cycling is always an option, even if you don't have perfect infrastructure, the infrastructure comes from people taking it up initially.  Vote Green and live your life, that's all that can be expected of you.  You can't solve this but you can help by not making it worse.

Don't listen to McKibben etal, these guys burn vast amounts of fossil fuels.  Fuck them, they're part of the problem, solutions will not come from them, it will come form people like you emitting significantly less and starting the low emissions lifestyle ball rolling

"dbvs47z","t3_5la6tx","5la6tx","environment","emotional","I definitely understand your feelings. I have (clinically diagnosed) OCD, and cycle between obsessive fears over climate change and nuclear war and health issues. I deal with them by compulsively reading everything I can, but it often just fuels the anxiety. I also have had that same level of microfocus on energy consumption and carbon emissions, where I've thought about how I'm adding to CO2 levels by breathing, or having heat on in the winter, or using the internet. I've felt doomed and hopeless a lot of the time, and, although I haven't actively thought about suicide, I've wondered about why I should try to accomplish anything in life when human civilization will collapse. 

The good news is that you're already doing the right thing by seeing a therapist. I started up again in December, and it does help. 

You're also taking action to improve your own footprint, which, according to my therapist, should make you feel less powerless. You may find that you want to get involved with a local organization, make donations to certain groups that affect national policy, etc. I belong to the Sierra Club, and give money to various other places. In addition, like you, I've changed many of my behaviors. 

I also would recommend knowing your triggers and avoiding them. For instance, I would recommend not reading these subreddits or the news (which I should be doing myself, but yay for compulsive behavior). They don't report the science around the climate well, and they reach the worst conclusions. I've literally read scientific papers that were ""well, rising methane is a potential issue, and here are five straightforward ways to fix it"", and the news/reddit discussions were ""oh god there's nothing we can do clathrate gun blah blah blah."" 

I've even taken myself off Facebook, because people kept posting about Trump's nuke comments and how we were all doomed, and it was making me have panic attacks. 

Anyway, as someone who has read the science COMPULSIVELY and who is a good reader, I don't get the impression that any mainstream scientists think that we are doomed. They still see scope for hope and action. It's just easy to lose that in the noise that is discourse around the issue.

I suggest reading ""a paradise built in hell"". You see, the collapse will be the greatest thing to ever happen to us. It will bring us together on a global scale. It will be the spiritual waking up and will usher in a great peace. It will be the necessary trauma to pull us out of this stuper we find ourselves in.

It will be hard and painful but we will look back on it with a smile, like giving birth. This world is quite sick right now. Personally I'm shocked at anyone who isn't a mess.

"dbvasxa","t3_5la6tx","5la6tx","environment","emotional","Anxiety is a fear of what *might* be, and can definitely be debilitating. As another poster mentioned, at the level you're experiencing it, talking to a therapist and getting some meds could possibly help.

Some may see this as burying one's head in the sand but I see it as a first step to treatment. Sometimes, one can be so stuck in the anxiety that all the logical discussion in the world can't help it. You need to be in a headspace that allows your mind to work rationally.

There are numerous issues in the world that can lead to the same, crippling anxiety. Climate change is your bugaboo. I'm not saying it's not serious, but if you let fear of what might be dictate your life, you'll be paralyzed. I've been there. Fear had ruined my life, leaving me hopeless and suicidal. Then I had my personal epiphany about fear and my life turned 180 degrees.

The key, for me, was digging deeper. The anxiety I had was not what it seemed. What is your true fear about climate change? It's probably not what you think. Ultimately, you have to unpeel the onion of fears to get at the core fear and address that.","2017-01-01 16:21:03","1","tedsan","1747764426.916893","climate anxiety","manual"
