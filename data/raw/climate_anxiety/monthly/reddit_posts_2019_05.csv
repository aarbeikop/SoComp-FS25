"boya8s","climatechange","action-oriented","Need some feedback on future plans","Hi all, hopefully you have been seeing me comment here and there. And I have read the sticky, but still would like some feedback on planning my future.

Background, mid 30s, live in southern semi coastal town, equipment mechanic (former car tech), former car guy (just ""woke up"" to the depth problem in the last few weeks thanks to reddit threads). Not perfect but definitely making steps to do better with my footprint.

So until about a month ago, was still chugging along, working on my project car and commuting to work from the suburbs as most do. Recently lucky enough to find a gf. Plans were to stay renting at my house next 2-3 years then buy my own. 

Now besides the anxiety the future gives me I don't know if I should consider getting a house or keep renting and move when climate change affects the coast too much (unknown if current gf will join). Currently paying off my daily driver as fast as possible so I can put money aside for a used electric/plug in hybrid. But from there.... how to plan? I will stay at my current job due to how we at least keep machines operating at the best they can (and rebuild some that help offset buying a new one).

You read all the potential pitfalls we may of missed in the predictions and who knows what will happen this election cycle. I don't have a lot of faith of people knowing to do what is best for themselves long term. I see how far tech has come in our lifetime (from Oregon trail to red dead 2, from corded wall phones to modern cell phones, the internet in general) but I don't think it will solve the problem in time, just delay it.

So td:lr: how do I plan for my next, 10, 20 years? What else career wise can I do to have a direct impact since I am not in a STEM field nor have a college degree (went, dropped out)? How do I plan for the future?","2019-05-15 14:00:09","9","28","0.72","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/boya8s/need_some_feedback_on_future_plans/","True","datcarguy","1747789268.651674","climate anxiety","manual"
"brag25","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm torn between being hopeful and being depressed....","Does anyone else feel this way?

Most of the time I feel crushing anxiety and depression, and I live in a near-constant state of worry. I am afraid for the world we're leaving for our children, and I am so sad about the effects that global heating has already had on other countries (especially on the most vulnerable). I don't think people are doing enough, and I am pessimistic about our chances to combat imminent threat.

But....

Then, sometimes I try to focus on the positives: the amazing work being done to clean up our planet, the steps we are taking in the right direction, and the fact that IF we can stave off complete annihilation we will have made a world that I actually will want to live in. A world that isnt as greedy, or destructive, or hopeless... a world that puts the earth first, instead of our own selfish species.

I tend to oscillate between the two viewpoints lately, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way? 

Living with climate crisis anxiety is exhausting... I'm hoping the next few years of change will have me living with climate crisis hope more often.","2019-05-21 13:30:30","3","9","0.59","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/brag25/im_torn_between_being_hopeful_and_being_depressed/","True","GypsyDanger666","1747789302.8612669","climate anxiety","manual"
"bqqzm5","climate","scientific","We're on a 1000 year journey","Bioregional activist David Haenke described what we are doing as a 1000 year journey. The road to sustainability isn't brief, it can't be trod in one generation, and it certainly isn't going to be finished in a dozen years, or whatever artificial deadline is trumpeted by some politician. 

Climate change is the tip of the melting iceberg of oncoming environmental challenges. Nothing less than a completely sustainable society is required to meet them all. One post criticised this idea as ""pollyannic"", but it is as cleareyed and realistic as it gets. 

Each of us might take individual steps toward sustainability. But none of us can do this alone. It takes inventions, infrastructure, culture to create a sustainable society. Those things take time to build. 

A sustainable human population is probably less than a billion. We will get to a sustainable population if we survive at all. The hard way is by denial and inaction, letting the cruel calculus of Malthus take us there. The easy way is by careful planning and transformation of our society over centuries. 

There will be setbacks and problems. Deniers and profiteers will fight us. Malthusian crises will challenge us. Plans and predictions will fail. Resources will dwindle. Only by keeping a constant vision of a sustainable future can we achieve that goal. 

Humankind has never kept a multigenerational focus well. We built cathedrals over generations. How much better would it be to build a ""cathedral"" of a sustainable society?

Folks post here frequently in despair over  bad news about climate. There is certainly plenty of bad news to find. You want to hear something truly depressing? The climate crisis isn't the only environmental challenge we face.  Anyone looking for fuel for depression and anxiety can set their mind ablaze. But a sustainable society nurtures its people in a sustainable state of mental health. We are now figuring out how to live with the threat of an environmental sword of Damocles over our heads. A steady diet of bad news isn't going to make us mentally healthy, and able to withstand the very real challenges ahead. We need everyone at the top of their game to make it through this challenge. This isn't going to be easy. Take care of yourself first. Turn off that bad news feed. Enjoy some actual nature - it's still out there. Come back when you can absorb bad news without feeling hopeless. 

None of us will live to see a truly sustainable society. Nor will our grandchildren.  It is our job to launch a thousand year journey that will get us there. It will happen slowly. One step at a time. One solar panel. One wind generator. One decision to delay childbirth. One greedy corporate boss that goes trout fishing, and suddenly gets it why we need to preserve wildness. One twelve year old that learns about a wild plant they can eat. One child who isn't bullied, who is judged by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin or the thickness of their wallet. 

If working against climate change is getting you down, take care of yourself. Anyone who says we gotta do all kinds of stuff right now isn't getting it. We aren't in a hurry. Hurry is part of the problem. You can't do all this by yourself. Nobody can. The horses have to rest. We're not going to fix all these problems today, or in twelve years or some other artificial deadline. From now on, humanity must monitor its impacts on the environment and mitigate them. We need to create a society that puts that idea right out front. We don't live there yet. We have to co-create it.","2019-05-20 04:43:49","11","9","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bqqzm5/were_on_a_1000_year_journey/","True","Henri_Dupont","1747789397.037021","climate anxiety","manual"
"brh0pb","climate","scientific","Apprehensive about moving to Florida for college..","I’m headed to Florida this fall to attend college classes in Orlando and the more I read up on all this the more scared I get.. is this even a smart idea? From the very crowded cities/highways, the vulnerable aquifers, and the hurricanes displacing people to the south, all of it is starting to get to me and cause anxiety. Orlando is the second safest city in the state for hurricanes but they’re still worrying none-the-less.","2019-05-21 22:44:34","2","8","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/brh0pb/apprehensive_about_moving_to_florida_for_college/","True","Samlikeminiman2","1747789399.834559","climate anxiety","manual"
"bpda8o","climate","scientific","Terrified and anxious about the future. Are we actually screwed?","I’m having a lot of anxiety recently with all this news about how climate change will cause our extinction and it’s going to be the end of the world. Is it actually as bad as everyone says it’s going to be, or is there some action going on in the world that is helping decrease CO2 emissions? I’ve heard there’s ways to capture carbon from the atmosphere but no one is using these techniques. Is there a way to significantly raise awareness of how bad climate change is really gonna be? Most people around me don’t really know how bad it is, so I think if we raise significant awareness, more people will vote for helping combat climate change.","2019-05-16 14:32:52","2","5","0.63","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bpda8o/terrified_and_anxious_about_the_future_are_we/","True","JakeHassle","1747789408.7423391","climate anxiety","manual"
