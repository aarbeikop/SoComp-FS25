See [Calling ""Game Over""](http://theaimn.com/calling-game-over/) and my comment [excerpt below]. 

 I frame the issue not as “civilization is doomed”, but “Fossil-fuel Throwaway Civilization is doomed”. FTC has already cut its throat, and facing that is a first step in collectively rethinking what kind of civilization is still possible. We’ll only survive if we reinvent our civilization, including production/consumption systems, corporate structure, even global justice and some form of population control. Climate Destabilization is an opportunity for all of us to cooperate for a better future. While we won’t have plastic junk shipped across the globe to throw out, we could have mutual respect and empathy, and wrest control from the corporate entities killing us.

Every household and institution in the world has a role in remaking global society, deciding how to adapt by replacing throw-away consumption and intergroup antagonism with cooperation and mutual respect. Instead of self esteem flowing from conspicuous consumption, with competing groups taking pride in devouring more of the limited resources, we could take pride in being Planetary Managers, our group doing more than others to invent a liveable future. We designed corporations to put profit above all other considerations, then let them loose to lay waste to the planet. Let’s compete to redesign them.

In sum, the way forward, casting off denial and fatalism, is to reframe our challenge. Fossil-fuel Throwaway Civilization is self-limiting! For those who don’t know where to start over again, I replay a scene from “The Highlander” where Adrian Paul says, “I reinvent myself all the time.” We’ll reinvent ourselves over and over, getting better each time – learning from our mistakes. In centuries to come, despite a far lower carrying capacity, humanity will emerge far better. And we’ll be proud.","2015-06-27 14:51:41","3","HumanistRuth","1747751465.922935","climate anxiety","manual"
