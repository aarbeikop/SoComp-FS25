I'm sure this is a common question, so please forgive me; that said, I really wasn't sure where else to go. Like many people, I've been aware of climate change in an abstract sense for many years now; recently, however, I've actually begun to take a closer look, and what I see scares the shit out of me. Every day, the news looks darker and darker, for my generation and for those that will follow. But even so, I have not been able to find a conensus estimate for what kind of changes I can expect to see in my lifetime. 

I'm 29, and I live in New York City. How vulnerable am I to climate change, and will I see its worst effects (read: a total collapse of civilized society) within my lifetime? 

Again, please forgive me if this isn't the right place for this, or if this has been asked a million times before. I'm in sort of a dark place right now, and I didn't know where else to go. 

Thanks. ","2016-04-29 16:12:29","10","24","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/4h04f9/experiencing_severe_anxiety_about_climate_change/","True","climateterror","1747758557.1723661","climate anxiety","manual"
