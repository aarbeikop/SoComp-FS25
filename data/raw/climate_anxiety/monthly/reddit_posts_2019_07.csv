"cjbr6b","environment","emotional","Dealing with Eco-Anxiety","In the last few weeks, being bombarded by all the media and facts about climate change (specially since most of my friends are a part of Extinction Rebellion), 

I got really depressed for a bit, as many times before when thinking about the same subject. I'm sure some of you can relate. 

If you have a spiritual practice in place, this article I wrote might be able to help dealing with, not the issue, but the emotions that are the effect of all the information.

If you like it, comment and let me know what you think or how you deal with it personally.

"ceggrg","collapse","skeptical","An Appeal to Extinction Rebellion","I have been suffering from what has recently started to become called ""climate anxiety"", essentially having an existential crisis over the fact that the problem with climate change is spiralling out of control for the past few years now (since my son was born just over two years ago). I was absolutely thrilled when I first heard of extinction rebellion last year, and although I am currently not able to move back to the UK and participate in the action directly (something I'm working on with a great sense of urgency),  I have been following the events and the strikes; I've been reading as much material as I can and have been watching RE talks on Youtube enthusiastically.

However, what I believe this movement is currently about to face is its biggest challenge yet, and is one which all movements and revolutions face is a barrage of problems from all fronts: A potentially dwindling movement through a slowing down of momentum (people essentially getting psychologically worn out from everything) and the counter strike from enemies. 

Members have even said it themselves, the protests in London managed to catch the authorities by surprise; no one really expected that ER's first mass mobilisation would be so wide-spread, effective or popular. However, make no mistake about it, the 'enemies' have taken note. Of course, ER is a humanist, environmental movement so it inherently does not really perceive any group or individual as an 'enemy' as it were. But others on the other side don't see it this way. Even now, those whose way of life is being threatened by the movement: The industry giants, career politicians who care only about lining their own pockets at the expense of everything else and the narcissistic and entitled part of the one-percenters with their warped priorities and sense of superiority due to their power and wealth. 

These people at the top understand only too well that the current constructs on which our society and modern-day civilization is built upon is not sustainable and is not going to survive a real paradigm shift like that one which is actually required to save humanity and what remains of our natural world which has been whittled away at over the course of the past half-century or so. They are more than content enough to just bury their heads in the sand and carry on as usual regardless of the consequences, not-unlike a terminal cancer patient who has already accepted their fate and has decided to just enjoy what time, however long that is, that they still have while they still have it. To these people, the fate of the dismantlement of society and the world as we know it and the construction of a new world according to new principles is one that is just as unthinkable as the fate which they know which they are already headed towards.

This is the problem, right now extinction rebellion is about to be caught in an asymmetrical war, one where both sides have both different values, strategies and world outlooks to one another. If extinction rebellion wants to survive and wants to become the influential movement which it aspires to be, and which most of us hope that it can be, it is going to have to adapt, and it is going to have to understand that the battlefield on which it is fighting is not a level one; saying that the battle which extinction rebellion faces is one of David and Goliath proportions would be an understatement, make no mistake about that.

I agree that the situation which mankind finds itself in is equal parts tragic, insane and perhaps even comical in a macabre way; the fact that mankind in its arrogance and short-sightedness is willing to endanger the existence of both the habitat from which it was born and which has nurtured it throughout its entire existence and also to endanger itself is almost too ridiculous to believe (this I believe is perhaps a problem which many people have when thinking through these issues, there is perhaps some form of logical reasoning that people would assume we could not possibly both be as extraordinary and ingenious as we have shown ourselves to be and also so downright stupid at heart), but it is our reality nonetheless. The fact that we are essentially killing ourselves and dooming our progeny over the 'market', the 'economy', 'politics', 'development' and a whole multitude of other man-made constructs really does prove that in the 100,000 years since our first ancestors appeared in the Serengeti, we really don't seem to have learned anywhere near as much as we thought that we have. 
However, those aforementioned 'enemies' (or at the very least, that is how they view you) will not be able to accept these realities, they will not stop, they will never see the 'bigger picture' or listen to reason. The president of the United States has shown us all too well who these people really are and what it is that they believe in. What we have on our hands now, is not just something as simple as an 'awakening' where people will all eventually come round and understand the seriousness off the situation; what we have is a class struggle.
So this is my appeal, ER you are going to have to start getting to grips with the politics of the situation. It is repulsive, it is perhaps in some ways contrary to the foundational principles of the organisation and possibly even counterproductive, or at the very least it is counterintuitive. You need to start playing the game, and what you, and what we all need to do is break the rules of the game together.

Consider this, we have all been laughing at the ridiculousness of the Brexit supporters for the past few years because of the fact that they have been constantly exclaiming about the urgency and necessity to leave the EU but have never put forward even the most meagre of realistic proposals in how we would do it in reality. In a discussion with UK government representatives I saw the same thing, when asked on how to reduce emissions to nett zero by 2025, one of the core demands of ER, none of the representatives there could even give a hint as to how this could possibly be achieved. We all understand the urgency, we all know that our situation worsens by the day, but if you yourselves as a movement do not have any concrete strategies, or at the very least some suggestions which at the very least managed to fall within the realms of possibility then how can you be expected to be taken seriously as a political movement and a paradigm-shifting force?

I personally have this suggestion, ignore the net zero emissions by 2025 for now, there is no need to say that it isn't a 'goal' and there is no need to give up on your principles, but you can first of all enter into negotiations and put forward a feasible plan that can work towards this goal. Personally, the goal which I have thought of is to make the UK at least 75% self-sustaining, both in terms of energy and food supply by 2035. 

Now why is this a good goal exactly?

It is actually quite simple, by becoming self-sufficient in as short a time as reasonably possible, the UK will be able to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. As long as the whole nation can be supplied with power and can be fed (ideally housed as well, but that can come a little later in the negotiations) then when the real catastrophes happen, the UK will find itself in a better situation than most countries. With our current lifestyles 75% self-sufficiency in actuality could potentially mean over 100% self-sufficiency if you account for the fact that our modern lifestyles are not really the bare minimum. Moreover, through the mobilisation of the country to achieve this achievable goal, emissions will be able to be reduced in the process; ideal: definitely not, but realistic: certainly.

By having an attainable goal you will legitimize yourselves as both a genuine movement who is showing to have the country's best interests at heart and you will also be giving people hope. The current goal is one which brings despair to many, and apathy to the others; zero net emissions by 2025, while physically possible, it is not realistically ever going to happen. By having unrealistic goals you are showing to many (whether legitimately or not) that you are just talk: All bark without bite; a fad that will be forgotten in due-time (What happens when 2025 comes around and we're not even close to the target?) But by having realistic, attainable goals you will be inciting hope, dispelling doubt and proving to those who are hoping for you to fail that you were doomed to failure from the start.
Pragmatic, attainable goals will both give you political credibility and popular support ,and will allow you to use this platform on which you have managed to establish in a remarkably short time to keep pushing forward and break down these barriers with which you are currently faced. 

Additionally, I believe that although the London protests did a great deal of good for the movement as a whole, continuing essentially doing the same sorts of protests are not going to get you much further. You are at risk of turning the public against you! Yes, we all understand that if we don't act now, the chances are that we won't be around for much longer, many out there are already aware of this, however by preventing them from going to their jobs, from preventing them to being able to sustain their families you are in great risk of turning the average working man against you. That is the power of this movement, these are the people you need the most! You already have the academics, the philosophers, and many middle class supporters who are happy to actively engage with your activities. However, what you need to do is both support and challenge the working class; you need to give them an opportunity to strike or to rebel, to show their support, make their message known and further the cause on their own terms. This is the most important factor of all: It must be their OWN terms. If you want to awaken the people, you need to let them act. The protests to this day from ER have all been restrictive, you should be aiming on making the people free. We need to free ourselves, we must extricate ourselves from our current prison which we find ourselves in and we must do that willingly. I do not think that road blocks are inherently bad, I fully agree with an ""every means necessary"" approach to a degree (barring violence of course), but you're going to have to get smart; you're going to have to start finding more precise ways of targeting the lawmakers, the tycoons and those which are trying to stand in the movements way through more lateral and radical methods.

For example,  I remember hearing about a politician who was followed around relentlessly by a person in a chicken suit as a protest over some policy. Imagine using these sorts of actions; imagine finding  ways to mobilize the workforce, of thinking up new and innovative ways where blue and white collar workers can do a protest in their own ways to show those above that we are not going to comply. Perhaps it's by not meeting deadlines in an office, if a whole office's staff refuse to meet deadlines together then they will very quickly reverse the situation with those in charge; perhaps it's taking a two-hour lunch break instead of one, perhaps it's complaining about any little discrepancy that is not 'by the book', perhaps it's through a general strike or through petitions. These are all possibilities, but really, they are endless; it should go from the macro to the micro and back again, every aspect of work life can be used to rebel in some way. Power needs to be given back to the working person, if they feel empowered than they actually  will be empowered. If the working person is empowered, your cause has strength.

I advocate pragmatism above all else, I have two kids and I hate to imagine the world which they will be living in, it's 90% there already to being the reality, we need to take that 10%, or 5% or even 0.01% and hold it tight. We need to fight with the whole capacity of our hearts and minds and then more if possible to overcome this. No single way will work, no single ideology or way of life is necessarily the right one, but all we can do is try, but by trying we cannot just use tokens; we must be as sincere as possible. 

What I have written here is merely my opinion, you may agree, or you may disagree but at the end of the day as long as you read it and think about it, that's all I ask for.","2019-07-17 18:07:07","14","18","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ceggrg/an_appeal_to_extinction_rebellion/","True","BenWClimate","1747791443.468682","climate anxiety","manual"
"cj5yuq","collapse","skeptical","A relevant passage from Søren Kierkegaard's ""The Concept of Dread"":","""One may liken dread to dizziness, down into the yawning abyss  becomes dizzy. But the reason for it is just as much his eye as it is the precipice. For suppose he had not looked down.  Thus dread is the dizziness of freedom which occurs when the spirit  would posit the synthesis, and freedom then gazes down into its own  possibility, grasping at finiteness to sustain itself. In this, A dizziness freedom succumbs.""

\- Søren Kierkegaard, ""The Concept of Dread""/ ""The Concept of Anxiety"" (depends on translation)

I  thought, given the existential dread and climate anxiety of this subreddit, this passage and the surrounding chapters from the the so called ""Father of Existentialism"" Sadboi Soren might be useful to some.
