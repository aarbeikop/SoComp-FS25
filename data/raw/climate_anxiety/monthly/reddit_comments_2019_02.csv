&#x200B;

Reddit is for the most part not a great place for non-bias sources, as you can probably tell it is VERY bias towards a democrat viewpoint. Which I believe for the most part, is actually very logical. Most of the general viewpoints are realistic and good, but the specific information written in a headline as a hyperbole because of the bias. Imo this is actually pretty good, especially because it's scientifically backed. Because of this it makes people who were on the fence (much like myself and many others I know) about voting much clearer. But because of this going to Reddit for world news (specifically climate change) is the equivalent of using WebMD to diagnose yourself. There is a lot of truth on there, but all you are going to do is make yourself more anxious by looking at it. What I recommend is looking up reputable sources even if a little bias (BBC, IPCC, etc..) if you are really interested. Do what you can to help and vote for who will help the situation but don't let yourself get caught up in the ""mad max in 30 years"" scenario. These scenarios are based on a worst case scenario (and even then its fishy asf) where we don't use technology to help what we have and also assumes we burn the maximum amount of fuels. As the U.S. and other countries make transitions to cleaner energy other developing countries will still be using coal and fuels. It is very likely we will not phase all fuels out in time, but we are also developing technology to help it out. All that's left is for us to vote and stick it to the people who are against green policies. As long as you do what you can rest assured worst case scenarios will be avoided (assuming nothing absolutely crazy irrational happens.) And I'm not saying this to make you complacent, I URGE you to make strides not only to improve yourselves but the world for us and the next generation. Humanity has so much potential, anyone saying it's already lost is lying to themselves. Hopefully I helped someone out with this, I struggled with this for the past 2 or 3 weeks.

As a recap I came to terms with it by realizing that:

A: We aren't in a worst case scenario, and the methane permafrost loop has debunked multiple times and is only accepted by very few scientists. Even if it were it's solvable.

B: As much as people claim bullshit on this statement it's true, as humans we have the ability to adapt to an EXTRAORDINARY amount of circumstances. We can and will adapt. However if we want to live in a future similar to today,  we NEED to take action as soon as humanly possible. Get climate change skeptics and deniers out of office, do what you can yourself to improve your life and make the changes you want to see in the world. Also the more you help YOUR community the better your area will be if worst comes to worst.

C: This is just general life advice but live your best life. You can do so being as green as possible but *live your best life*. Find love. Have children, teach them the importance of life and how to learn from past mistakes. Find something you love and whole heartily enjoy doing. Unless aging is cured or somehow the singularity pops we are all on a limited lifespan. The universe is vast and whether heaven or hell, or nothing at all if you live your best life, you've done everything you can.

This is what the Media calls the ""business as usual"" model, but should more accurately be called the ""we've lost our damn minds"" model.

Under this scenario, we're doomed and all of the horrible things you've read may very well come true.  Under any sane reading of the science, however, none of the horrible outcomes will come true any time soon, and probably won't come true, ever.

Consider this: Syria has been in a state of severe drought for 15 years.  It is the worst drought in hundreds of years, and is likely driven by climate change.

The loss of livestock and crops from this drought made farming untenable.  About 1.5 million people left the country-side and came into the cities looking for work.

This created the civil unrest, which triggered the ongoing civil war.


The long and the short of it is that the planet will not be able to produce what it needs to feed the population.  Even if we managed to keep it under 2 degrees warming, we would still be looking at a series of climate-driven wars and mass migrations.

IMO, the more immediate thing to worry about is already playing out: mass migration. While not a sole cause, the mass migration of people from the Middle East, Africa and Central America are all exacerbated by climate changes in those countries. Many say the Arab Spring from a few years ago (that led to revolutions in Egypt, Lybia, Tunisia, Syria, etc.) ignited when a heat wave in Russia led to crop failures, which led to Moscow stopping exports of wheat, which led to price spikes in the Middle East, which led to riots, which led to war and mass migration.

This is the kind of damage that climate change will lead to in our lifetimes. The worsening storms, flooding, fires, etc. will pale in comparison to the terrible political disruptions shifting climate will lead to.

However this is literally the first actually predicted ""**APOCALYPSE**."" Nobody has ever been able to successfully predict any apocalypse whatsoever(duh).  
1) We're all in agreement that if our energy consumption keeps rising at this same exponential rate, or even if it continues at the same rate (including every kind of energy  and how we source it and use it - from food to fuel) , this will bring about an eventual ""apocalyptic world,"" and perhaps even an actual apocalpyse where no-to few humans and human organizations survive. If we don't take active measures specifically to combat this, apocalpyse isn't a matter of ""if"" but ""when."" But yes, the actual apocalyspe isn't in 15 years. Not in our lifetimes either, probably not in our great grandchildren's lifetimes either. But, again, apocalypse is certain.

2) Now the ""when:"" if we're talking about a 12-15 year time scale, the frequency of natural disasters and the loss of landmass to sea will cause billions of dollars in damages, and hundeds of million displaced people as well. So it will be ""apocalytpic"" even then, at least for us, when all those poor distraught immigrants start banging on everybody's doorsteps. Remember, conflict in Syria resulted in around *10 million* displaced people, of which around *1 million* or so sought refuge in Europe, where the *740 million* Europeans collectively shit their pants. Climate change will do that to *hundreds of millions*, all over the world.   


Now, of course, you can skip #2 if you want. Cuz that's the worst case scenario: best case scenario maybe in 15 years you just never need to wear a coat again if you were already in a place with a moderate climate, like Spain or Greece or Japan, or Seattle. It's just not gonna get as cold in the winters, with maybe some natural disasters happening a bit more frequently, and a few unimportant, tiny islands lost. 

But that really does not matter: we now know literally what will end up destroying all of humanity, and we know its causes, and how to stop it, too. No priest, no prophet, no fortune teller, king, shaman, has ever been able to correctly predict an apocalypse (duh.) But our scientists have. They have predicted how the apocalypse wil slowly and surely come about, they have outlined possible risks and dangers that it will bring with it as it starts to grow, and they have also found the causes of this apocalypse, and detailed many list of ways to stop this apocalypse from actually taking place.  


And the apocalypse is man-made.   


There's no reason to change the topic from global warming to a convo about ""let's not be doom and gloom."" If we're talking about global warming: the mood is gloom and doom, because it's all doom and gloom, there is no reason to deny it. Global warming is a literal existential threat to humanity, and to treat it as if it weren't is not helpful.   
We can talk about Neo-pets though if this attitude sounds ""severely unhealthy.""   
If you wanna talk global warming , you accept the reality that it's at best an existantial threat to the way we all live our lives, and at worst the actual extinction of the human species. ","2019-02-19 08:00:36","0","Chasmatesh","1747786835.993238","climate anxiety","manual"

Granted in any bad scenario, there will be more favorable spots: higher spots to avoid sea level rise, places that may keep enough natural ecosystem for animals and humans to live in even though it's gonna be tough. Any body thinking about this as a safety net ?

Also, shouldn't we stock pile medicines etc for when harsh time will come so we have a buffer to absorb the shock ?","2019-02-14 02:08:14","5","agumonkey","1747787265.837981","climate anxiety","manual"

First is a magnetic pole reversal.  Combined with everything you've listed above, and factor in that only the US military and maybe some of its allies are ready for the EMP-like global pulse, you are already talking world-wide crisis as everything comes to a standstill for at least a couple days, and potentially weeks, and potentially months.  


Second is a ""solar flash"" or it has been termed a ""micronova"" from our Sun.  This is the more serious one.  By... lots.  


Best case scenario is if somehow the magnetic pole reversal DOES NOT concurrently trigger the Sun, and we get some time to recover/prepare.  And by prepare, I mean move underground.  


And while there won't be any ""walking dead"" zombies... there WILL be millions of potential survivors who did not prepare, and who will roll over anyone who did prepare and take all your stuff.  Those are real ""zombies.""","2019-02-17 09:00:41","1","SG_StrayKat","1747787265.851451","climate anxiety","manual"

Which happens sudden and goes high. Causing Antarctic and Greenland to schitt out, and a major increase in Volcanism, coming on rather sudden, Setting fire to forests, and obscuring the sun. causing a sudden cooling, and resulting thermal shock leading to a mega quake.

And all the estimates go into the toilet.

And the only people left are those living in light structures in warm climates who survived the nuclear winter effect of the volcanism and fires.
