Everything from eliminating baths to not drinking out of plastic bottles or with straws and lids. It's all you can do ya know, your best.

I have a 50 acre property off the grid, in a rural area, at the end of a dirt road, 50km from the nearest town,  on solar energy, in an area with a mild climate. I live a minimalist, more self sufficient, sustainable, low carbon emissions lifestyle, had a vasectomy and I only vote for politicians with similar views.  My partner and I have very low consumption levels (gave up my job, she has a low paying part time job that she gets to on the school bus or by car pooling) and we've built resilience into our place and learned resilience skills along the way  (gardening, woodworking etc etc)  We've been on that path for coming up to six years.  

I have done all I can on a personal level to not throw gas on the fire.  That gives me immense satisfaction and peace.  Now, I am just an interested observer and commentator.","2015-07-28 23:22:28","11","Capn_Underpants","1747752537.8015392","climate anxiety","manual"

"ctjltxt","t3_3exnp7","3exnp7","collapse","skeptical","If I lived near a major city and had a family and a mortgage and my life was unavoidably dependent on the success of our current economy and social structure, I would be deeply troubled by the state of things, so I can see why a lot of people just ignore things or trust the hopeful messages of politicians.  

But, I'm single and relatively young and unburdened.  I recently moved onto a farm in a fairly remote part of the country and I'm learning a lot about growing food, building, hunting and fishing and just generally living a simpler more independent life.  I'm saving up money for some land of my own.  It might not matter.  I might be screwed anyway.  Or civilization might rumble on for the rest of my life.  

There's no way to be certain of anything, but I take comfort in the fact that I'm preparing myself as well as I can.  In a way it's kind of freeing.  Deep down I always felt that life in the mainstream of society just felt cluttered and fake and sad, but leaving it felt like I was being some kind of fuck up, loser, etc..  now I feel like it's a lot more socially acceptable to do what I'm doing.
