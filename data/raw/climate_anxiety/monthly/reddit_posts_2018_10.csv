"9mxhq0","climatechange","action-oriented","Is there no hope?","I feel like a lot of what I'm reading is really getting at me as a depressive person, and with how idiotic the political climate here in America is as a person concerned about our climate change issues I can't help but feel hopeless and depressed about the future. I don't know if I'll want to live 20 years from now if what I'm reading is any indication of our future outcome... am I only seeing one side? Is my worry being blown out of proportion? Is there any hope? Could you guys maybe enlighten me a bit? I'm having a real anxiety and depression attack right now and could use some more informed opinions...","2018-10-10 07:56:32","11","22","0.79","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9mxhq0/is_there_no_hope/","True","FargoneMyth","1747783640.5238478","climate anxiety","manual"

"9rtxi6","collapse","skeptical","Prove me wrong[Contrarian]","1. Lab grown meat uses 99% less land, 45% less energy and produces 96% less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional meat. Three quarters of global human land use is for animal agriculture. Lab grown meat will be in restaurants, [by late 2018](https://www.fastcompany.com/40565582/lab-grown-meat-is-getting-cheap-enough-for-anyone-to-buy). The only reason conventional meat can be sold for low prices today is because of agricultural subsidies and a government that allows meat producers to pass on their negative externalities to the rest of us.

2. [10% of US oil consumption](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245296) could be eliminated overnight if people with jobs that can be carried out through telecommuting started telecommuting.

3. Ordering groceries online can reduce the carbon impact of shopping by [80-90%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/30/ordering-groceries-online-is-greener-than-driving-to-the-store/?utm_term=.a2cf05d0f569).

4. Self driving cars can reduce the number of cars needed on the road by 99%, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. A 90% reduction of vehicles in operation would reduce our overall emissions by 15.9%. Fatalities in traffic can be reduced by 99% through self-driving cars, so insurance costs for human driven cars will go up dramatically. The average car is used just 4% of the time. Most people will have no reason to own a car again. The safety created by self-driving cars and prohibition of human drivers creates a positive feedback loop, as people living in big cities become willing to walk or ride their bicycle. If your groceries are delivered to you and you work from home, why would you want to own a car?

5. One kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide. The Great Barrier reef perishes because people are unwilling to do the patently obvious: Add sulfur particles to jet fuel for airplanes flying over the Great Barrier reef, when weather predictions suggest large temperature rises lie ahead. Humans have removed sulfur pollution from the air, but sulfur placed in strategic positions helps avert the worst effects of global warming.

6. Seaweed production has grown [50%](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265518689_Current_status_of_global_cultivated_seaweed_production_and_markets) in the past ten years. Global seaweed production has more than doubled between 2000 and 2014, from 10.5 to 28.4 million tonnes. Seaweed sequesters carbon dioxide, sequesters pollution by nitrates, reduces local ocean acidification and decreases local temperature. Demand for seaweed still dramatically exceeds supply. Seaweed produces nutrition and shelter for fish, when seaweed is grown, fish numbers increase too. Seaweed cultivation consists of creating attachment points in the ocean, in places where almost no life grows because of the absence of such attachment points. Rather than competing with existing ecosystems, seaweed cultivation gives birth to new ecosystems.

7. [Global bivalve production](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emerging/bivalves.pdf) from aquaculture has consistently increased over the years from 7.1 million mt in 1995 to 11.9 million mt in 2005, an average increase of 6.8% annually during the period. Aquacultures contribution of bivalves to the overall bivalve production increased from 72.8% in 1993 to 87.3% in 2005. Eating more than 100 gram of shellfish per week reduces risk of a heart attack by 60%. Shellfish production continues to increase enormously around the world. The shellfish consume large amounts of algae in the water, thereby reducing eutrophication. Shellfish production is at risk of ocean acidification, but through combined growing of seaweed and shellfish in the same area, this risk is effectively addressed.

8. Global mushroom production increased [over 12% annually](http://environmentalscience.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199389414.001.0001/acrefore-9780199389414-e-231) during the period from 1981 to 1997 and continues to increase to this day. Mushroom cultivation uses 99% less space than beef, to produce the same amount of protein. Mushrooms are cultivated on agricultural waste products.

9. Point 1, 6,7 and 8 effectively illustrate why we won't have an agricultural crisis, because we are transitioning to sustainable alternatives at an amazing pace. Half of global food production is currently wasted, according to the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In case of a sudden food shock, price signals would flow back to consumers and consumers would have to reduce their waste of products. As governments change their subsidy policies towards agriculture, price signals will change human diets towards healthier proportions.

10. We've discussed why we won't have a food crisis, why we'll massively reduce our carbon emissions, who we will free up large amounts of land for carbon sequestration and why we can effectively prevent the worse impacts of climate change as we transition to a sustainable form of energy production. Demographic winter needs to be discussed too. The field of aging medicine is transitioning from a perspective of treating the symptoms of aging, to eliminating the damage. Senolytics increase the average as well as maximal length of life expectancy in mice. The first trial in humans are underway too. Senolytics will increase the reproductive window of women and increase the amount of time that elderly people can remain productive participants of society. The demographic decline of Europe, Japan and North America will decelerate, because the current citizens of these nations will live much longer lives than we currently project. The Dutch statistics agency (CBS) has had to revise its annual life expectancy projections upwards for most years of this century. Current life expectancy projections are simply [too conservative](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2018/10/any-and-all-trend-projection-models-showing-slow-incremental-future-increases-in-longevity-are-simply-wrong/).

11. No serious climatologists predict that positive feedback loops will come to dominate anthropogenic global warming within this century. Guy McPherson is entirely at odds with the scientific consensus.

12. What else do I still need to debunk? Zombie apocalypse? A solar flare? That canary island cliff falling into the ocean and causing a megatsunami? ""You just have too much dopamine in your brain""  No, human beings have a cognitive bias in favor of bad news. A guy at the Amsterdam train station stabbing some tourists and being shot dead within ten seconds gets more attention on the nightly news than the fact that life expectancies today are higher than they have ever been in recorded history.

13. Life today is better than it has been at any previous point in human history: 

-People are taller, healthier, more intelligent, friendlier towards each other, have more opportunities in life, speak more languages, live longer and read more books. 

-Literacy is higher than it has ever been.

-Both male and female genital mutilation are dying out.

-Christianity has imploded and the churches are empty, Islam is starting to implode too. 

-Psychedelics are effectively used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, MDMA is effectively used to treat social anxiety in autism, Psilocybin and NMDA Antagonists are effectively used to treat treatment-resistant depression, psychedelics have been discovered to reduce suicidality by [60%](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/9/e016025.full.pdf). Even violent criminals can be rehabilitated through use of psychedelics in combination with psychotherapy.

-Abortion is being legalized around the world, leading to a decline in child abuse and a decline in population growth. 

-Fertility rates are declining in the most fertile nations. 

-The United States has more trees than 100 years ago, England has more trees than it ever had in the past 700 years.

-The Anthropocene has [increased biological diversity](https://www.nature.com/news/the-anthropocene-could-raise-biological-diversity-1.13863).

-Rainforests are expanding as Central American rural peasants migrate to cities. Human beings use less space, to have better lives than ever before in recorded history.

-Arranged marriage and child marriage are dying out.

-Violence and rape are dying out.

-Slavery is dying out.

-Child labor is dying out.

-Democracy is spreading, royal dynasties and dictators are overthrown.

-In contrast to most of human history, most of the world's wealthiest people earned their money through their own effort. The world's wealthiest people plan on donating over 99% of their wealth to charities that make the world a better place, while actively recruiting other billionaires to join them in this endeavor.

-You have more free time than at any previous point in history we can measure. Just 150 years ago, you could expect to spend 80 hours per week at work. Today you spend barely 40. You have more vacation days, more parental leave and you're increasingly allowed to work from the comfort of your own home.

Where is the collapse supposed to be? I can't see it. Some of you reading this will probably still be alive 200 years from now, as your bodies are exposed to senolytic cocktails that remove the subset of cells that accumulated the most damage and accidental deaths are nearly eliminated through self-driving cars. Perhaps you'll be reading it on Mars, with a resurrected passenger pigeon sitting on your shoulder. Please be so kind to think back of this moment by then. Or prove me wrong.
