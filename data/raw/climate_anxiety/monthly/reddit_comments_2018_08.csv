It's difficult to help you because you don't have any other posts and you don't say what it is you are worried about, beyond the vague ""barrel of a gun"" thing. 

But you could start with [this summary](http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2013/10/coverage-of-extreme-events-in-ipcc-ar5.html) of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says about floods and storms.

"e4vsgwh","t3_99ijce","99ijce","climatechange","action-oriented","I think the most important thing you can do is to seek help from a therapist or other mental health professional.

In the meantime, perhaps it will make you feel a little better to read up on environmental policy success stories, like the Montreal Protocol, DHT ban, or the Clean Air Act.  The US has taken steps to protect the environment in the past, and I for one am confident that it will do so again in the future.  

It might ease your mind to get involved in some environment- or climate-related programs (for instance, if you live in a community that's prone to wildfires, maybe you could volunteer at homeless shelters or help clear away dead plants or such).  To be honest, though, in terms of ""fighting climate change"", I think the most important thing any of us can do is vote.

You're absolutely not alone in feeling this way.  It's healthy to be concerned by climate change (it is a concerning issue!) but it's not healthy when it starts to affect your sleep and mental health.  I really recommend talking to a therapist about how to manage your anxiety so that you can confront the issue of climate change constructively, but also go about your daily life without feeling the kind of stress that you have been =/ Best of luck!","2018-08-26 21:24:47","6","janequeo","1747781901.063842","climate anxiety","manual"

The world will change, and the course may get rougher, but how much you, your wife and your children will feel of it depends very much on where you live.  It's not facing a terminal illness of the planet. Imagine living on a tropical island with the water inching closer every single year.  Or living in a river delta in Bangladesh and owning not much more than the clothes you wear.  That's dire.  We are, cynical as it may sound, more or less spectators of the show.  Yes, summers may get hotter, precipication more damaging, hurricanes more threatening, wildfires increasing - but it's not as if we don't know all of those things already.

Find out more, take the Climate Reality Leadership training, join a local group and find your area of interest and take action.  Your anxiety is real, and given there is no ""flight"" option fight is the only way forward.  I have found that taking action makes in clear that we can all make a difference and change the future for our children and grandchildren.
