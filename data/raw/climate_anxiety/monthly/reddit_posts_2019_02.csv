"ar64um","climatechange","action-oriented","How to deal with Climate Anxiety","Having lurked on this thread, and experienced many of the issues that other members have faced i.e. a sense of doom and gloom and helplessness ib this situation, I thought I would offer some advice on how to mentally deal with this scenario.

In an age where continual growth is the aim, where 'smashing our goals', and competing against everyone is all that matters, we've lost a sense of perspective. Life has become ubfeasible.

The truth is, you alone cannot solve the world's problems. Most of us can't even solve the problems of people closest to us, let alone the lives of strangers thousands of miles away. So, let's focus on what we can control. This is where stoic philosophy comes into play.

The stoics believed that there are only two things you can control; everything else is secondary. They are:

1. Your thoughts
2. Your actions

You cannot control how hot the world is going to get. You cannot control the decline of biodiversity. You cannot stop fossil fuels burning. 

What you CAN control, is your behaviour which can ultimately affect the world in a positive way.

Your job, every single day, is to simply focus on being the best citizen you can be. Being environmentally aware. Being positive. Whether you influence those around you or not, is out of your control. So don't worry about it. 

Remember this, and you will feel better about yourself, will worry less about how others will perceive you, and without realising, your actions will have impact.","2019-02-16 06:21:39","35","5","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ar64um/how_to_deal_with_climate_anxiety/","True","TrepurYarrum","1747786753.52494","climate anxiety","manual"
"arcasw","climatechange","action-oriented","Why I’m skeptical with climate change","Before everyone goes at me, no I’m not a climate change denier. I believe it is real and most of it is man made. However, some of the predictions on the news I find questionable. Such as the “12 years until we’re doomed” meme going around some climate alarmists. I believe that this is just the minimum time when we can stop warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we have a _little_ more time until things start to get chaotic. This is coming from a soon-to-be 15 year old, and I believe that some of the exaggerated claims and fear mongering in some climate news is incredibly damaging to the mental health of teens and adults. 

No, we’re not going to be cooking alive and the sidewalks start melting like we are on Venus in our lifetimes. Things WILL suck in the near future, but we can survive. It is not completely bleak, like alarmists say. Is it concerning? Absolutely. Will there be an apocalypse in the next couple decades? The world, as we know it, may severely change, and some may feel like it is the end. But it is debatable, and I believe we should attempt to work to help it, but also focus on our own lives. As being all doom and gloom about this can be severely unhealthy. This is what can lead to depression, anxiety, and suicide over this problem.","2019-02-16 19:48:53","8","31","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/arcasw/why_im_skeptical_with_climate_change/","True","Sylveon_Fan","1747786835.5828962","climate anxiety","manual"
"aq39gm","climatechange","action-oriented","[Meta] People posting about their anxiety or their personal fears on this sub","Hi :B

I haven't posted much here, but I am intrigued by the recent spike on young people posting on this sub about feeling despair, anxiety, uncertainty, or outright fear about the years to come, the threat of climate change and other environmental issues.

Although I believe that's a very valid concern, [I think there are enough threads tackling that issue already](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/aq1l8g/is_there_any_hope_for_my_generation/egcvfa4/) and I feel it would be much easier for many to search something already posted instead of just create a new thread to talked about an already discussed issue. 

Is there a way to advice those people to see one of those earlier threads instead of creating a new one? I am not proposing an anti-""*I am 15 and I'm scared about the life I will live*"" posts rule, but I do feel that we around here should be more efficient tackling this issue.

"aq9wlu","collapse","skeptical","How I think things will go down","I expect to live until mid-century (2050-60s). A teenager today may live until 2070-80s. A baby today might possibly make it to 2100. I will not see 2100. My children may not even make it. My grandchildren (if any) likely will.

Based on the RCP 8.5 (which we are tracking dead center with), between now (2020 roughly) and the end of the century, we will see:

•	Average global temperature rising 4 degrees, leading to:

•	Extreme weather events (all seasons) – with decreasing resources for rescue, rebuilding.

•	Droughts, heatwaves, permanent “wildfire” season (Typical year in central US will be 1930s Dust Bowl conditions)

•	Rising sea levels (1-2 meters by century end), sunny day flooding in all major US coastal cities. Real estate collapse.

•	Water shortages, crop failures, declining yields, famines, food price shocks.

•	Civil unrest/civil wars, mass migrations – particularly for equatorial countries.

•	Increase in epidemics due to civil breakdown in many parts of the globe. (Polio returned in Syria during civil war. Measles, mumps, etc. return easily when parents don’t vaccinate.)

•	Animal habitats and countless species will disappear. (Coral Reef will be lost)

These themes will repeat and grow in intensity as time goes on. How exactly they will fall and interact with each other is unknown, but the logic holding them together is clear. They are happening now. 2040 will be far worse than now. 2060 will be far worse than 2040. Etc. I will see things get much worse in my lifetime. My son will see it get worse. My grandson will see things get even worse. Year to year, things may be easier or harder than the previous year. But the general trendline will be easily understood and felt by everyone.

**There will be technological innovation.** There will be pressure for “drought-resistant” everything. New kinds of building materials. Increasing security and tracking of citizens will have a health rationale. Even new forms of investing products will be developed to deal with the new normal. Some things will work, some things won’t. Some innovations will have unexpected consequences.

**Some will have it easier than others.** Everyone will experience climate change in a personal, physical way. Some will have their lives utterly ruined. For others it will be a more psychological affliction, like living during the Cold War. That won’t make it less anxiety-inducing or terrifying. Some people will become better humans (saints), others will become more inhumane.

**There will be a war between “short term” survival and “long term” mitigation.** As things get worse, countries will have less extra capital for moonshots and risky R&D—and they will be less likely to want to save the world when they have trouble feeding and protecting their own. Fewer people will care about making the world better for 2200. In democratic countries, at least, the votes will go to those who can promise the preservation of a certain lifestyle rather than those who call for public sacrifice.

**This will only be the beginning.** All these trends will continue to get worse in the 22nd Century. I won’t even live to see the end of the first chapter. My children may not either. I will see a world in worse shape than anything my predecessors ever saw. For me, it will be collapse—the end of the world as I knew it. But the changes will go on for centuries.

**It is already happening. And it won’t happen tomorrow.** All these things are happening now. They are already showing signs of “record” levels. Many of these things (like sea level rise) are locked in no matter what we do now—though we could (hypothetically) mitigate the worst of it. For most of us, this collapse isn’t going to “happen” a year from now or even a decade from now. There will be no zombies. No bomb shelter warning. It will be the background story of our lives, for the rest of our lives. It will shape the personal stories of everyone on the planet. It may end up killing you specifically or not. It may up just being a general misery or anxiety for some people. Even so, it really is the end of the world as we know it.
