"b5qeq8","climatechange","action-oriented","Has eco-anxiety influenced your parenting/parenthood decisions?","so i am a student and journalist writing for my college publication as well as the online magazine [theoutline.com](https://theoutline.com) so this is a topic i would be interested in like writing about but i've been thinking a bit about something a few friends of mine have mentioned about how they are planning to not have children themselves or plan on choosing to adopt when they'd originally wanted to have children themselves in reaction to the climate prospects we face. i've never wanted children so this wasn't something i'd considered but hearing them talk about it really broke my heart because clearly this was something born out of their general eco-anxiety which we all share. at the same time when i told older friends of mine this, they kind of dismissed it as ""oh they'll grow out of that"" and i just don't know if it's so simple? i know there's been discussions of the ""ethics"" of having kids amid the climate crisis but im more interested in going beyond the theoretical and getting at the actual implications/results.

i guess the **tl;dr** of what im trying to get at, especially as an undergraduate college student, is whether folks who are already parents or planning families have taken practical actions out of their eco anxiety to shift what their families will look like (no kids, adopted kids, no more kids etc.)

\[*disclaimer*: ofc anything you reply to this **won't be used** in any article im just seeing what other folks outside of my friend group have considered on this. if you want to help with/talk to me about the possible article pls feel free to message me, would love to hear your perspective.\]","2019-03-26 14:31:52","35","78","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/b5qeq8/has_ecoanxiety_influenced_your/","True","cawf33_bean","1747787616.551757","climate anxiety","manual"
"axk2g5","climate","scientific","Undergraduate Interest - Climate and Mental Health","Hi folks, 

As an undergraduate student in Environmental Geography, I've often been left wondering about the more deep-seated consequences our climate - not necessarily a changeable one - may have on humanity.

As such, while we often hear about the multitude of threats - whether directly or indirectly - to human survival that our current anthropogenic ""climate crisis"" poses, I wonder whether humans around the globe are becoming increasingly anxious on the basis of inaction. 
Think of it as a ""fight or flight"" response, where anxiety can be triggered by first-hand experience or reading of potential prognostications about the planets future, alongside that of our own species.
Are there any researchers, civil servants or common citizens amongst us who feel as though their mood, well-being or general outlook has diminished over time with respect to the changing climate?
If so, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on how your mental health has or has not been affected.

Sincerely,

A BSc undergrad in Environmental Geography","2019-03-05 11:19:57","3","3","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/axk2g5/undergraduate_interest_climate_and_mental_health/","True","AFwuertzen","1747787783.718373","climate anxiety","manual"
"b7ppb8","collapse","skeptical","Just finished listening to The Uninhabitable Earth","A few thoughts:

* Some have said it is nothing more than a laundry list of worst case scenario consequences. There's a section of that, but that maybe takes up only half or less of the book, I think. The best parts of the book are his discussion of cultural narratives we already have that either unconsciously speak to our anxiety or create barriers against reality. (He discusses how Silicon Valley ideology can only imagine itself as the greatest threat to existence through A.I.)
* As a long-time collapse follower, I would say that there is not much you haven't heard--but it is comprehensive. It includes discussion of Guy McPherson, Dark Mountain Project, potential feedback loops, etc., for example.
* I was surprised that the majority of the worst case material was not things that will happen, but things that are currently happening or happened in just the last 5 years or so. In that way, the book is not that speculative and shouldn't be dismissed as mere speculation. I actually forgot about many of the global disasters of late--or forgot that they happened so close together.
* Clearly, Wallace-Wells is as thoroughly read-up on this topic as anyone I know. Refreshingly, he doesn't pick a solution to fix the problem. He says at the end that he agrees it will require a WWII level global mobilization--but wonders if our current global society is even capable of doing such a thing. Basically, 2 is guaranteed at this point but 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 degrees may not be.
* He isn't hopeful in the sense that he thinks we can fix this problem easily or even fix it at all. But he does still think we have a choice between putting on the breaks or accelerating into the disaster. The uncertainty in climate futures has a lot to do with human action. Somehow we admit we are powerful enough to change the climate inadvertently, and yet deny that we are powerful enough to do anything about its consequences. We are gods who, in awe of our own powers, consider ourselves impotent. When we retreat, we abdicate responsibility and action at the very moment in which our actions have the greatest impact on the world and the future. That's my crib. To be honest, I find it somewhat compelling.
* I will probably read this book again. Maybe in a few months or a year. I will probably give copies to a few choice friends. It is a well-written summary of what I think is going on. I think it's an important book.","2019-03-31 16:43:44","66","18","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/b7ppb8/just_finished_listening_to_the_uninhabitable_earth/","True","climate_throwaway234","1747788198.7050529","climate anxiety","manual"
