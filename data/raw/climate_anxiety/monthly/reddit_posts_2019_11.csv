"e06otx","collapse","skeptical","Sublime Madness ( I post this as a comment on another post, but we need to stop the defeatist attitude here)","I am working on a plan, but this is a message to all of you who don't believe we can overcome this.  I'm in fear of the collapse but these numbers are actually quite relieving to me. The majorities are pretty much all on our side (our side being humanity). They are trending more this way by the month and year, are the numbers overwhelming no, but they are trending in the right direction. Literally the last couple months I have been fearing the recent reports, because they basically all say were underestimating everything (My sleep and poops are awful due to anxiety). Both my grandfathers have been skeptics, but over the last couple years they are coming around, espically the one whom was a farmer his whole life. His buddies are struggling in part due to tariffs but also due to poor weather. I do think we are a couple years away from being unable to avoid the hot house effect, but we only have one option, and that is to win. Losing means death, and so we must have believe in miracles, and we cannot give up, never give up. No war can be won with a defeatist attitude, and so therefore we must believe. Tell people the information with compassion, do not understate anything, and give hope. DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FATE AND DESTINY, FATE IS IS UNAVOIDABLE, DESTINY MUST BE TAKEN. It is our destiny to prevail, I will not trade humanity for nation, I will not trade humanity for greed, and I will not trade humanity for power. If I were a betting man I bet the house climate change wins, but I am not a betting man, I am a rebel, and that requires a thing called sublime madness. Sublime madness is no matter the odds, no matter how big the army I will take on and beat everyone. The uprising is happening look at South America, the middle east, and Europe. We cannot devolve into hate and fear, this will divide us and be our downfall. This revolution must be one of love and forgiveness, all humans are redeemable (yes even the wealthy elite, we are going to need their access to their resources, knowledge, and organizations. I know its a big ask to forgive those whom would allow this to happen, but it is the only way we win). The difference between coward and brave hero is not that one fears, they both fear, you can only be brave when you fear. So buckle up the next couple of years are going to get hot, but we only have one option, so either hide and cry, or prepare yourself mentally, spiritually, and psychically because we will need everything of you perhaps even your life. But I will not lead you anywhere I would not go myself, I'm prepared to die for you and this beautiful planet. Yes I'm basically asking you to fight (whatever you believe in) against god, the universe, and the celestial overlords, that have turned their backs on us. I have sublime madness and you must too if we are to prevail. But I will not accept a defeatist attitude because it undermines and infects everything. I love all my brothers and sisters, we are all part of the same tribe, and that's humanity.","2019-11-22 20:20:20","0","18","0.22","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/e06otx/sublime_madness_i_post_this_as_a_comment_on/","True","YOUNGBULLMOOSE","1747794596.265397","climate anxiety","manual"
