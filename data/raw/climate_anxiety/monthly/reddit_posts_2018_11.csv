"a1ogbi","climatechange","action-oriented","How to deal with climate change anxiety?","I've recently been having anxiety due to climate change. I think part of the issue is that I'm taking an environmental psychology class where the professors drills us on the devastating impacts climate change is having/ will have. Our final project was actually on PSA related to climate change. Thankfully my last class for environmental psychology was Wednesday. The other source is just the general news, which I plan to limit my interaction with.

&#x200B;

How do I deal with this? Everytime I'm stuck in traffic, I can't help but think about how many people there are (overpopulation) and how much CO2 is being emitted. Are we really that screwed? Will it devastate our generation, or the following generations? If I can live my live relatively normally for the next 60 years, I'll feel so much better.","2018-11-30 03:00:15","19","17","0.79","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/a1ogbi/how_to_deal_with_climate_change_anxiety/","True","WildPipe","1747784330.1418839","climate anxiety","manual"
"9wb677","environment","emotional","Tell me why I should stay positive","Hello, everyone. I'm here because I have terrible anxiety about the planet. I do everything I can to make sure I do my part...in whatever means I am able. I conserve, recycle, and donate as much as I can. Please give me a reason why I should even think we all won't be dead in 10 years. I'm terrified.","2018-11-12 05:22:15","15","13","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/9wb677/tell_me_why_i_should_stay_positive/","True","iheartcacti","1747784630.094867","climate anxiety","manual"

Just a tiny dose of cynicism..How our fear of automation is yet another symptom of a perverted system

&#x200B;

I spend a lot of time mulling over the collapse will inevitably befall us and I suffer from a lot of anxiety. However, I had been in a conversation with coworkers about how my line of work is in danger from eventual automation, and it set off a series of thought.

&#x200B;

Human societal collapse is the best thing that could happen to our planet. 

&#x200B;

Hear me out: I'm pretty pissed off about this but lets take an idealistic stance on the subject for a moment. If automation were used in a fair and equitable way- it's job should be to reduce the needs of jobs for people around the world. However, just the opposite has been playing out in our reality. 

   How fucked up is it that instead of AI being a boon to man, our greed has turned it into a boogeyman destined to make life even harder for the majority. We perseverate so much on the me and mine way of thinking that we are willing to let everyone die to ""get mine"" during the ""everything must go decades"". How fucked is it that we are told that ""climate change efforts would spontaneously occur if they were profitable"" and most individuals just accept that. 

&#x200B;

Rant over, we can now go back to worrying about our inevitable demise as our governments continue to hide how fucked we are until the curtain call and everyone continues their day to day as if their kids have a future and they will actually die of old age.

Cheers!","2018-11-16 15:05:40","20","2","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9xmx8k/opinion_piece_just_a_tiny_dose_of_cynicismhow_our/","True","oroca","1747784998.742593","climate anxiety","manual"
