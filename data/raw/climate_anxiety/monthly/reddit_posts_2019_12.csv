"e9vc1t","climatechange","action-oriented","For those high school or college students worried about climate change... (Advice)","I was 16 when I learned about climate change/read the IPCC and knew then that shit was going to hit the fan and affect my future. From that moment, I decided I would dedicate my life to learning about it and doing what I could to fix it. 10 years later I have a masters in climate science and working towards a doctorate. There are options out there for people who want to make a difference but choosing the correct outlet (major in college, courses, etc) is important to get you to the right spot, I didn’t know what to look for or how to get into the field of climate change. Academia is not for everyone but it should not be overlooked - multidisciplinary studies are needed between STEM and humanities for this crisis. No matter what you want your future career to be, you can in someway incorporate climate change and sustainability. I mention a few tips below but feel free to ask any questions about the field of climate science or how to incorporate it into a future career path. (My guidance counselor in high school had no idea what to tell me and I ended up changing my major twice - I want to be sure advice is available for those who are interested!)

1) just because you are bad at math or chemistry does not mean you would not make an excellent scientist or researcher, no one is perfect and everyone has their strengths/weaknesses

2) if you want to focus on climate change or just want to learn more about it, try to major/minor in earth science/geology - it will give you a good background. Even just taking one or more earth sciences classes is really beneficial! If you don’t see climate on the syllabus - ask your teacher or professor to address it in class. Public schooling doesn’t do the best job of talking about the intersections of chem, bio, physics but geology/earth science does. Also talk to professors/teachers about what your interests are, they should be able to help you find a direction better than a guidance counselor

3) incorporate your anxieties of climate change into your work. Incorporate the idea of being sustainable into everyday life. Class project/paper/presentation? Incorporate climate change. Sometimes you have to be creative with how things are interwoven but honestly it will affect most everything - economics, health, ecosystems, food + water supplies, real estate, politics, social sciences, etc. Addressing it from every angle will help us to be more prepared. Also it could give you leverage when applying for jobs etc that you have a multidisciplinary outlook.

4) if you are interested in climate science or research, look online for universities with research programs based on climate change that are in your interest. Reach out to professors to see if they need undergraduate helpers - I have seen these opportunities turn into masters many times. 

Please only ask relevant questions, not here for the denial trolls.","2019-12-12 23:13:08","11","24","0.73","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e9vc1t/for_those_high_school_or_college_students_worried/","True","paleoclimatologist11","1747794868.904978","climate anxiety","manual"
"e7rlxq","collapse","skeptical","About that sidebar's paragraph about mental health, and climate change adaption.","I think it's very well written and on the point of current agendas. Unfortunately it is counter productive and should be addressed, because in my opinion those current agendas are wrong. I am referring solely to climate change. As with anxieties and many other mental disorders, there are ways with coping and overcoming, many along the lines of confrontation and acceptance, instead of upholding wrong beliefs and premises and thus living from triggering to triggering.

I am a strong believer in climate change adaptation (btw, thanks for that specific flair!). I want to express that we should not fear what's coming (and by now we're quite sure it's coming), but work towards it, and invest engineering, man power and resources, political aswell as financial, into a safer and promising future instead of a broken and futile status quo. Everything else is irresponsible but sadly exactly what I am expecting from mankind.  Irresponsible in the sense that we should look out just for ourselves, our planet itself will stay a planet with all the ecosystems and biodiversity it will harbor no matter the state it will be in.

Looking forward to your responses!","2019-12-08 09:01:15","10","5","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/e7rlxq/about_that_sidebars_paragraph_about_mental_health/","True","Stierscheisse","1747795423.997787","climate anxiety","manual"
"e4smic","collapse","skeptical","Just a few thought.","I’m new to this thread and just wanted to share a few thoughts. Us as human beings are the only species to realize what’s happening to our climate and how we’re fucking it all up. But no one wants to do anything at the end of day and just post pone it to the next generation. I personally don’t even want to have children just so they don’t have to suffer in the future. This whole situation give me anxiety. How do I cope with all of this?","2019-12-02 03:04:35","5","5","0.73","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/e4smic/just_a_few_thought/","True","therealrattb","1747795427.19808","climate anxiety","manual"
