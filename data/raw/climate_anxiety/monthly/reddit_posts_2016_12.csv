"5laam9","climate","scientific","Serious anxiety about the climate to the point that I'm considering suicide in the long term. Really scared. I need help, I need some glimmer of hope.","Hi all,

I made a throwaway account as my main account is one that my friends and family know about. I've dealt with anxiety for around eight years. I had full blown panic attacks over the thought of non-existence for about 9 months straight and eventually got a hold of it. They've come back over time, with one stretch being about a month long, but I've learned to somewhat manage it when it happens. I still, from time to time, grapple with the fear of death though.

Last year, I had about a week's worth of panic attacks and anxiety when I stumbled into a thread on /r/environment where someone asked how doomed we were. This absolutely wrecked me for about two weeks. I still don't know what made the pain and fear fade away, but it never really left my mind.

I became somewhat obsessive about the energy usage of myself and others to the point that I would watch a video of an activist interviewing someone and think ""the microphones are using fossil fuels right now."" Absolutely microscopic stuff. It didn't kill me, but it made me obsessive. I made changes in my life over the year - I've greatly reduced the amount of meat I eat (and I eat no red meat whatsoever now), changed out all of the lights to be LED, started to grow my own food, buy mostly local when I can, etc. I live in St. Louis, so biking and public transportation are not really great options here, but I have cut down on travel.

Fast forward to this week. I have the whole week off work, and had plans to finish a book I was reading, watch some movies, etc. I was alone in the house, and all of the sudden, for no real reason, my anxiety about the environment fired up really fast again, which has now lasted for about a week.

I'm 28 and I am absolutely terrified. I read things from people who are optimistic about climate change (Al Gore), to people who seem a little more in the middle (Bill McKibben, Eric Holthaus), to people who seem downright ready to be in the doomsday bunkers (Guy McPherson). I have always known that the situation wasn't great, but despite my personal belief that humans will survive, the idea of total collapse of our civilization by 2100 or before has crippled and paralyzed me. I feel absolutely helpless because the problem is so much bigger than myself and overwhelming. I'm a naturally pessimistic person, which makes me believe that humans won't change fast enough, no matter how much the rest of the world that cares about this does.

This has caused me to wonder why I should want to live in a world down the road that is headed towards total collapse. I am struggling to get out of bed. I have barely eaten. I feel like I'm the only one who sees this and is reacting appropriately. Even people who are on the front lines seem to somehow be able to live lives, which is even crazier when I consider that some of them have children, who will really see the brunt of this.

/r/climate, does anyone share these feelings or have gone through them before? What can I do to ease this? What hope do I have over this issue? I'm seeing a therapist later today, but I just needed to get this out there.

"5fw2uw","collapse","skeptical","why keep going","I absolutely can't fathom living anymore. Everything is going to end soon. Climate change has absolutely sucked all joy out of life. I look around me and all I see is death. I envision every tree I see dead or on fire, supermarkets destroyed, corpses everywhere from food riots. When I hang out with people I just think about how we will all die soon from civil war, disease, and poverty as the world's rulers retreat into their temples for a few final years of self worship. When I'm alone I just constantly think about how little I'm doing to stop it and feel guilty but then remember that there's absolutely no point whatsoever in even trying to change anything and then just feel a huge amount of anxiety. All the depression and anxiety I've worked on shedding over the last few years is returning. I think about dying all the time but I don't want to kill myself.","2016-12-01 11:23:29","25","48","0.79","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5fw2uw/why_keep_going/","True","fatal_strategy","1747763959.42583","climate anxiety","manual"
