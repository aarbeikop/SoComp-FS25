The only thing that makes me optimistic is the fact that many people all over the world is now worried, and talking about these issues, which makes it harder and harder to ignore by the people who can actually do something about it.

I'm already determined to never have kids as I don't want to contribute to overpopulation. My sister announced two days ago that she's pregnant, and I'm very conflicted. I'm happy that I'm going to become an uncle, but at the same time I feel it just makes the problem worse.

I've gotten over the worst of my anxiety by starting a Superworm (Zophobas Morio) farm. Entomogaphy, the practice of eating insects, is frowned upon by many, but it's also one of the most environmentally friendly, and cost / energy efficient ways of producing non-plant based food there is. Shrimp, crabs and lobster are carrion feeders that literally eat shit and rotting stuff, yet we consider them a delicacy. Superworms and other homegrown bugs, you feed them whatever you see fit, like oat meal and leftover fruits and vegetables.

I try to inspire the change our society needs to go through to become more sustainable, and the only way to remove the stigma around it is to talk openly about it. Defeatism benefits nobody. The best we can do is to talk more openly about these problems we face despite it being painful to think about. Make others think and talk about them too. Talk about possible solutions.

You might not get any good answers here, or flack for running an ""undesirable"" company, but it's nice that you are thinking about sustainability.

Source everything as locally as possible.

As you mentioned, meat-alternative burgers and lab grown meat

Cricket burger? I'd love one. Maybe even ""make your own"" patty using cricket proteins?

Can you pop solar panels on the roof? Or buy your electricity from a specific source?

"eb7ccpc","t3_a3i7zl","a3i7zl","environment","emotional","Great post! Love to see committed businessman trying to do what's best and humbly asking for advice! Admittedly I do not know much about burger business in the US but here is my 2 cents:

\-Look for local, sustainable meat: While high meat consumption is a huge problem, local small-size animal farming can even improve the environment.  Sustain good farming practice through your business. This means not to choose only one good producer, but wherever you expand look for local sustainable solutions and promote them. Besides the environmental impact, I really love restaurants that showoff their suppliers and you might get awesome new products! Work with them to make their and your business more environmentally friendly. Maibe it is only me but I would definetely prefer a restaurant that works directly with local farmers and is not afraid to show it!

Also, from the environmental point of view, chicken is better than pork which is better than beef (but all of them can be damaging or sustainable, depending on the size, the context and the way in which they are farmed)

\-Reduce the size: I realize this must be tricky especially in the US, but I bet that if you add good vegetables /other ingredients to your burgers you can reduce the size of patties. See picture below for example:

\- Reduce and recycle your garbage: give away leftover food, reduce water consumption as much as you can, do no throw the used oil in the sink, make compost with organic material, install separate bins for plastic and glass in your stores

\- BE adaptable and open to changes: you are already on the right track (and again, my sincere compliments for making such an effort). But know that making your business sustainable is a everlasting process that will change in different places: sparing water makes a real difference in Texas, almost insignificant in Alaska! Same for buying products locally. Do not limit yourself to one way of doing it  but be creative and open to suggestions. If you speak about your objectives with your suppliers and  environmental associations in your area, you will get tons of ideas on ways to improve the sustainability of your business, new products and way to cook them. This will make your products stand out and create links with your community (good for business too).

\-Finally, find a good way to monitor what you are doing. You cannot believe how many efforts are put into things that are actually not that impactfull. Find ways to count how much you spare in co2, land, water and money. Share them with the public and make your customers be a part of it (e.g. a water consumption meter in the restrooms saying something like: this is how much water we have saved today by installing better faucets and you closing the water right away). I cannot provide you one right now, but I am sure you can find them on the net. 

All the best and let us know how it works!","2018-12-06 09:45:59","1","ciskoh3","1747785430.3232121","climate anxiety","manual"

When will we start seeing machines and artificial intelligence take over the restaurant industry? Companies such as [Tenzo](https://www.gotenzo.com/), [ifood](https://www.ifood.com.br/), and [giftameal](https://www.giftameal.com/) are already making their mark on this industry. 

By 2023  we can expect these [technologies](https://blog.gotenzo.com/future-of-restaurant-technology) to start taking over: 

Smart tables- Smart Tables is a really powerful prospect which will definitely change the front-of-house scenario and could entirely eliminate the idea of going up to a counter or even a kiosk for that matter.

Self Serving kiosks- Kiosks also have the ability to store individual behavioral ordering data like the different age groups or genders and the ordering time per customer - this analytic data can be studied to provide business insights and prepare for future customer offerings.

Wearable tech- Link front to back-of-house staff to send important customized details like order preferences & real-time changes.

"ecj4k9v","t3_a9e1kp","a9e1kp","collapse","skeptical","I’ve recently gone through the same mental journey myself. Slow realization, followed by an increasing sense of dread and panic. Late 2016 kicked off a rough patch for me, between Trump and a college course which revealed the severity of climate change to me. I became a miserable alcoholic. Drinking was the only thing that could take me away from the knowledge I was walking around with, the impending doom of it all.

I fell down a really dark hole. I dropped out of school and broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. Rehab and AA did nothing to curb my drinking. Even when I was sober, I was horribly suicidal and depressed. I found solace in video games (“Celeste” being especially helpful) and music (endless thanks to Kevin Parker), and regressed into a private world of reinvention.

Then it hit me. I’m gonna die anyway. Today, tomorrow, in a year, in ten or twenty; completely alone in a freak accident, or alongside billions of others in a collapse event, I WILL DIE NO MATTER WHAT.

In the meantime, I get to enjoy the internet, the pinnacle of human achievement. Anything I want to know, I can know. Anything I want to listen to, any game I want to play, any movie I want to watch. I carry the wealth of human information around in my pocket. How DARE I be depressed?

Recently, I’ve started working with my local homeless population. I don’t deserve the luxuries I enjoy, so the very least I can do is dedicate some time to spreading the wealth. I feel fulfilled, with brand new eyes. Life is a trip. Everything is worth paying attention to, and we can derive meaning from every experience we encounter. I’m reminded of this quote from Hayao Miyazaki:

“There cannot be a happy ending to the fight between the raging gods and humans. However, even in the middle of hatred and killings, there are things worth living for. A wonderful meeting, or a beautiful thing can exist. We depict hatred, but it is to depict that there are more important things. We depict a curse, to reveal the joy of liberation.”

"ebriacp","t3_a625x9","a625x9","collapse","skeptical","On good days, accepting that I’m just a speck of dust in an infinite universe helps to keep things in perspective. Human existence is a small part of a cosmic timeline. When we were are ash, what beautiful new beings might arise? Personally I think birds have the advantage to survive catastrophic collapse but that’s another subject. 

On bad days, well, let’s just say I self medicate until I can focus on thoughts that are not collapse related. On some days, the overwhelming weight of sadness and despair crushes my spirit to the point where I don’t want to leave the house. Then I have to remind myself that nothing is an absolute. Things could change. Humanity might survive but the next several decades will be a struggle for all species on the planet no matter what happens. I try to make the situation less about me and more about the planet as a whole. Then I read about wilderness survival, edible wild plants, and prepping for disaster because when the SHTF, I’m headed “into the wild”. I’d rather die alone in the forest than in the city surrounded by immense suffering and loss. 

Most of all, I remember to just breathe then turn on some good music. No one here gets out alive anyway. ","2018-12-14 12:36:43","2","gr8tfulkaren","1747785735.138842","climate anxiety","manual"

There is no moral requirement to follow the news, especially when you see the general trend. It's all still true, even if you are not following it. The doom will be there when you return.

Seriously, I unplug every few months and it helps with the emotional shock--not because you are hiding from him, but just because your physiological system needs a break from it.","2018-12-14 15:44:56","2","climate_throwaway234","1747785735.141844","climate anxiety","manual"
