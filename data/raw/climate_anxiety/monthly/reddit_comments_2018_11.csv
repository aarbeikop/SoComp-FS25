"eas34kq","t3_a1ogbi","a1ogbi","climatechange","action-oriented","This comes around almost every day here. ""We're screwed"", ""I'm suffering anxiety"", ""devastation"", ""catastrophe""  etc etc.

The posts are usually very vague, containing no facts or science (what are you scared of?) so it's hard to respond. 

They are usually from young people who have seem to have been brainwashed by the climate activist doom cult. 

I usually respond by quoting some things from the most recent IPCC report. You probably believe, because you've been misled by your psychology profs, that things like floods and storms are increasing. But they aren't. Here's what the IPCC says on floods

> In summary, there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency
of floods on a global scale.

And on storms:

> Current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century

We should all do the small voluntary things - vegetarian, wear a sweater, recycle etc.  But the real solution is going to be the involuntary things like a carbon tax.  A high tax, like $250 per tonne given back to the populace as equal payments (like a basic income) will help the poor and lead to a reduction in carbon.  I’m going to agitate for this.","2018-11-12 07:06:55","6","[deleted]","1747784631.252688","climate anxiety","manual"

In 10 years there will be minor changes. Planet Earth changes count in 100s and millennia. In the 2100 there will be visible changes like water level rise, more deserts globally and greenery in tundra (which is happening as we speak), higher global temperatures (summer, colder winters), human migration from flooded/draught areas etc. Sounds pretty bad, I know.

But positive things are happening every day. From local levels like proper recycling and actually creating new thing from old, secondhand shopping, zero packaging shopping, electro cars, buses and trucks, biofuel public transport, people going more vegan than before, cycling encouraged in major cities (at Europe mainly), children getting information about the climate change and impact of it, school projects on ecology and sustainable living, more people are choosing sustainable alternatives, off grid living, living in the symbiosis with nature. To government level: a lot of countries are changing their emission's targets, citizens convincing their Governors to take climate change seriously (unfortunately this doesn't work on Trump).

Concerned people are staying positive and trying to do something. Take The ocean clean up as an example. The guy dropped from school to change ocean plastic pollution. And his project launched the first 'garbage eater' (don't remember the proper name, sorry) this autumn. How amazing is this? Or the girl who saw ugly consequences of plastic pollution on the marine life. She wrote a song about it and eventually created a campaign 3P (pee,poo,paper) to stop flushing other things down the toilet (like tampons, cotton buds, nappies, condoms etc). I find this pretty positive. Hope it helps...","2018-11-12 09:31:59","3","LotaMraz","1747784631.271265","climate anxiety","manual"
