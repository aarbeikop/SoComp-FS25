"dcy28n","climatechange","action-oriented","Needless to say I am one of the many Eco Anxiety sufferers, and I need more clarity so I can stop panicking.","I don't know if it's dramatic, but I have literal terrible panic attacks about climate change. There is so much I have yet to do in my life, career wise, traveling, getting married, building a house, having kids. Every time I see an article or thread talking about how climate change will kill us in our lifetime if x, y, z doesn't happen, I go into a panic attack. How do we smaller individuals stop these big things from happening, how do we stop the oil companies, etc? Are we just helpless? I want to have my own family so bad, but is it even fair to my potential children if the world is just going to burn before they have a chance to see it, what's even the point of doing anything, of living, if global warming is just going to end us all in the next few decades. Sorry if this is dramatic, but I'm scared, I have a tightness in my chest. I need some sort of hope or reason, anything optimistic to make me stop panicking, is there any way I might die of old age with a big family and a successful life, or are we just going to burn before I get the chance? Are there any good outcomes with the state of climate change rn?","2019-10-03 22:07:42","59","55","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dcy28n/needless_to_say_i_am_one_of_the_many_eco_anxiety/","True","lilbabybruja","1747793219.951586","climate anxiety","manual"
"dem1p1","climate","scientific","[serious] Previous scientific predictions of catastrophe","This is in no way questioning the science of climate change or it's predictions. Nor is this meant as trolling, it's a serious discussion. I've got a subtler point to make. Throughout the 20th century there were a number of well-known scientific predictions that didn't work out as predicted. Let's look at four cases (there are hundreds) The cases looked at here tended to fall in two classes - cases where the world, in fact, responded to the prediction and mitigated the issue, and cases where the science was sound but new technologies or discoveries changed the game. 

Given the generally dire predictions about climate change, I believe this point could actually be a reason for hope, not based on scientific predictions themselves, but on things that those predictions may not have considered. Please hear me out.

Rachel Carson famously predicted a Silent Spring. Her science was spot-on, the cause was taken up by many others, and DDT was banned along with other pesticides were banned or regulated. So the prediction of a Silent Spring did not bear out. But fast forward 60 years, and we are seeing a precipitous drop in bird populations, not from DDT killing their food sources and causing thin eggshells, but from other factors - habitat destruction, windows killing migrating birds, and some other factors we haven't identified yet. Rachel Carson's specific prediction did not come to pass, thankfully. Her science did not include the factors that are now making a Silent Spring more likely. 

The scientific history of Peak Oil prediction is littered with the bodies of scientists who got it wrong. A key example was Hubbert, who's prediction that oil production in the US would peak about 1970 seemed spot-on for years, until new technology changed the game. Once again his science was spot-on and very predictive, but new technology he could not have predicted changed the parameters. 

Paul Ehrlich famously predicted imminent doom in his book The Population Bomb. Once again his science was good, but the Green Revolution was just getting under way, a new technology that made his points moot. For now.

In the late 1970's, new satellites detected a previously unknown hole in the Ozone layer. Scientific predictions, and observations in the tip of South America, predicted disastrous outcomes - crop failures, rising skin cancer rates. Wild animals becoming blind. The world responded with the Montreal Protocol, and now 40 years on we are seeing the Ozone hole receeding. Occasionally, noncomplaint polluters are caught violating these protocols, as happened in China in recent years. Thankfully, these very credible predictions did not play out. 

Do these cases in fact give us cause for some hope that the worst predictions of climate disaster will not come to pass, due to either effective mitigations by the world community, or unpredictable factors that even the best science cannot take into account? There is so much gloom and doom here, and a weekly post by some poor soul who's mental health is affected by anxiety, can this actually be a source of optimism? The rational science says we're heading for a train wreck. Is irrational faith in Humanity justified? Is such irrational faith actually required to keep us sane and focused in the right direction?","2019-10-07 16:44:22","1","6","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/dem1p1/serious_previous_scientific_predictions_of/","True","Henri_Dupont","1747793377.519845","climate anxiety","manual"

Lyrics\*\*Cocktail Umbrellas in the Rain\*\*

Lyrics – Corinne Friesen (Lovarra)

So, I got them to pass a law

And now I think I’m done

Sittin’ on my golden halo

Getting’ praise from everyone

Cocktail umbrellas in the rain

Stopping now would be insane

‘til the air we breathe is clean

We gotta get down to reality

Every moment we’ve gotta care

What we’re spewing into our air.

I see you do you see me?

We gotta get down to reality

Keep goin’.

(Spoken: “Oh ya. Alllriight.” )

Dreamin’ of a fancy car

And just what that will take

Gonna let that one slip through

And take it off someone’s dinner plate.

Everybody stops to stare

Cause they’re choking on my air

I see you do you see me?

Gettin down to reality

Keep goin’On by

We’ve got bigger fish to fry.

Til the ocean waves are clear

We’ve got much more work to do right here.

(Spoken: “Right now. Ohhhh, yah.”)

Standing on the shoulders

Of those who’ve gone before

Now’s the time to act as one

Build that wave

And push for more.

Vote, Walk. If you use it don’t toss it 

Pull big offenders out of their closets. 

Action is the remedy  

For our fear and anxiety  

All we have is the power of one  

But we all have that, Everyone! 

Together! 

Right now!  

Keep goin’!","2019-10-26 20:34:30","1","4","0.56","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/dnjd4q/my_song_to_energize_your_climate_action_rallies/","True","Lovarra","1747793379.779765","climate anxiety","manual"
