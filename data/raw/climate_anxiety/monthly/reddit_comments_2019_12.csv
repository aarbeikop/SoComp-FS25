Remarkable illusion.

The earth being destroyed by corporations without even a single questioning. Countries and communities are being destroyed without being mentioned in media. The poor are being slaughtered. And you want us to be happy and get our piece of future?

Future was eaten in the past.","2019-12-08 11:00:59","8","k3surfacer","1747795426.651218","climate anxiety","manual"
"fa3pm5s","t3_e7rlxq","e7rlxq","collapse","skeptical","To deny the implications of climate change is to postpone one’s mental breakdown into the future. And then, the situation will be much worse than it could have been. I too believe that acceptance is the first step in this case because it really helps to put things into perspective. People need to stop relying on the belief that everything will turn out okay somehow - our technological progress is unprecedented throughout history and never before did we have the power to really put an end to our own existence (except for the Cold War, but that could’ve turned out very differently).
This acceptance should not lead to defeatism but fuel improvements instead. In our personal lives, in our economic behavior.
Even the smallest improvements are worth something, we are yet to see whether it can affect the big picture in the end.","2019-12-08 09:16:03","7","[deleted]","1747795426.653214","climate anxiety","manual"
