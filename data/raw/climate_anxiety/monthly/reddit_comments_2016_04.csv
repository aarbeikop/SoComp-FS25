There are many things (measurements, experiments and simulations) that say that the world is warming and this will have bad effects in the future (sea level rise, droughts, ocean acidification etc.).  There are a few things that say the future will be terrible (tipping points).  Finally, there are a few things that say the future will be fine (negative feedback. ex. as the world warms there will be more clouds which will reflect more light back to space which will cool the earth.)

No one knows which future is certain.  

What we know is that every choice you make does have an effect and giving up doesn't help.  So use your concern for the future to live your life in a way that helps that future.  Buy a fuel efficient car, install solar, eat less meat, use public transportation, etc.  Also, lead by example.  Wear your environmentally friendly choices as a badge.  Show your friends that you are making a difference without scarificing your quality of life.

So start sitting no need to become a spiritual person, just start sitting.","2016-04-29 17:38:00","4","[deleted]","1747758560.954091","climate anxiety","manual"

I find this an exciting, inspiring time to be alive. How often does a single generation get a chance to save the world? And it is very savable.

(The downside: You probably won't see a total breakdown of society in your lifetime, but you may well see an emerging mess of civil conflicts in poor countries; refugees on the move; tropical diseases spreading northwards; larger hurricanes and floods, etc.. And, of course, you'll pay steadily higher taxes to deal with all of these.)

So what you'll see is bad weather, occasional disasters and a general downturn. Just like we've had for a decade or two.","2016-04-29 19:12:46","2","rrohbeck","1747758560.95839","climate anxiety","manual"

""Modern"" civilization has been on the verge of collapse for centuries - ask an Aztec, Roman from 500 CE, ancient Egyptian...

Nothing to panic about, but some day people will be amazed at the fascination we had with little green pieces of paper.

It took me about 3 years to come to terms that we are likely past the point of no return.  This summer's methane measurements will possibly be the QED on things.

Enjoy what you do!
