"eypw3ub","t3_cxzswj","cxzswj","climatechange","action-oriented","It is my biggest worry for the future, and really my greatest worry period. Everything else, and I mean EVERYTHING else, can be undone, at least in theory. But climate change is today, tomorrow, and the tomorrows after that, and there's nothing we can do now to undo it. Mitigate, yes; unmake, no.

I just see a future where, due to climate change, everything gets worse for just about everything and every one, for decades and centuries and even millennia. All of our achievements, every ounce of progress, has only served to foster this cataclysm. It puts all of human history in a gloomy light. Can I really take pride in the achievements of our past, when all of that culminated in THIS? It's hard. It's rewriting the past and the future and not in a good way.","2019-09-01 04:51:23","5","[deleted]","1747792429.108675","climate anxiety","manual"

In my community we are seeing high levels of cancer, autoimmune disorders, developmental disorders so much god damn shit concentrated into an area in both the young and the old. What research is finding is many of the chemicals in our environment effect metabolic and mitochondrial function. Most of the focus now in media you will hear cancer thrown around a lot. It is not just cancer. In the elderly we normally see the decay of these functions with age making them overall more susceptible to disease. We are seeing increasing rates of earlier onset of disease in our youth because of our environmental exposures making us more susceptible. If you create these conditions in women it will increase their babies risk to developmental and immune disorders even in younger women having children not just the risk we are told that comes with having a baby when you are older. My community lives near a chemical valley. Right now these companies are trying to argue against regulations of their chemicals stating we need them. They are right we do need them. We need them to be fucking responsible god damn adults because if they had properly took actions the moment they knew health risks non of this shit would be happening but they chose profits over the health of us, our children, and their own workers.
