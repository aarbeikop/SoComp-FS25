"esj0jw5","t3_c2bfyv","c2bfyv","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","First, recognize that anxiety is useless. It is a brain state that evolved to solve immediate, tractable problems, like hiding from a predator, or suffering social disgrace in a tribe of 100 people. It has no utility in addressing climate change at all. Not a bit.

So meditate. A lot. Train your brain to be in a relaxed, calm, and prepared state. Calmness is not denial. Calmness is not acceptance, or defeatism. Calmness is calmness. It is the appropriate response to a multi-generational crisis.

The amount of pain coming is intense, and can be a problem even if your individual life is OK. Anxious people tend to be more empathic, and it is easy to have searing, gut wrenching compassion for people in Chennai who have run out of water, for example. Guilt, too, for your part in the global economy. 

But your compassion will kill you, and you will grieve yourself into an early grave. And in the end your psychological torment will count for little, and help no one. 

If we are going to get through this, it will not be through constant fretting and sleepless nights. If we survive, it will be by voting the right way, trying to spend the right way, and generally pushing the needle in the right direction.

I am 39. I never imagined as a teenager that we would have gay marriage or mainstream vegetarianism. Sushi was a bizarre food that I had never eaten. The internet was all dial-up. 

Back then I sure as hell didn't know anyone who took global warming seriously. And here we are. Everyone is talking about it, because we can finally see it. Things happen slowly at first, then suddenly. 

Meditate. Just breathe.","2019-07-01 23:28:54","6","Windbag1980","1747791039.407945","climate anxiety","manual"

"eu2ozu6","t3_ceggrg","ceggrg","collapse","skeptical","Overall it was good read. XR does need to have more realistic goals, rather than imaginary ones. From this reading I assume you’re a Marxist? You talked a lot about empowering the working class. Essentially, giving them a platform to express their grievances. All in all, like you’re perspective. I think you should consider public speaking in some sort. Maybe unite the masses.","2019-07-17 20:22:12","1","[deleted]","1747791443.809559","climate anxiety","manual"
