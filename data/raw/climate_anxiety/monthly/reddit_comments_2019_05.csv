"ennazh6","t3_boya8s","boya8s","climatechange","action-oriented","I had been researching about everything ranging from global economy to cultures to science/maths to psychology to politics and business since last 6 years.

I am a computer engineer, art hobbyist, entrepreneur and an explorer.

Change of any kind is inevitable, especially after late realization. Change is nothing but consequences of actions taken. 

Now whatever our past generation had done is not in our hands anymore. But if you connect the dots looking backward you’ll see root of the problem is how humans operate.

Humans operate everything from their minds.

Now when we grow up by copying others we don’t realize that many of the actions we take don’t make sense in our time at all.

It is because we never really question but follow what other people are doing. It is not that we don’t get questions but we keep mum to protect our social acceptance.

So the root cause is our animal instinct (or compulsive behavior) powered by super cerebral capacity. There is nothing human cannot conquer in outer world but when it comes to controling feelings and thoughts most of us are quite helpless because our education system has not taught us about maintaining an energy controling house deadlier than nuclear bombs, human brain, which has capacity to destruct or construct anything that it wants. 

The only thing it doesn’t know is threat to itself from its own unconscious behaviour. 

I am aggressively promoting concept of Spiritual Entrepreneurship after achieving a mental state called Gyan Yoga (Intellectually we can see how everything connects with everything and what roles we can play with whatever time and energy we have). I am creating intellectual fission process where self-awarness (not the current self that you refer by the name, which is given to your body by the society) is neutron hitting hard on ego (fake self) to break it down. 

This will create more self-aware beings who can create more and more as chain reaction. Once you start being conscious about your actions you’ll be able to see through things (imagine Dr. Strange quickly scanning every possible action and its consequences to decide one that is constructive or least destructive).

DM if you want to join a telegram community of Spiritual Entrepreneurs where I share pieces of real life events and how it connects with other parts of life. 

That fight is against our own corrupt-self.","2019-05-15 18:15:53","1","pntrivedy","1747789270.6456141","climate anxiety","manual"

"eoc9sc8","t3_brag25","brag25","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm going to tell you about my own experience.

I'm aware of global warming since the age of 18 (I'm 32). When I was 18 I was genuinely scared about it, I didn't really want to have kids, especially when I thought that snow would disappear from the area I live in. I joined Greenpeace, and started preferring bikes and trains to travel.

Then, I thought about climate every now and then, but finally decided to have kids, because my personal and professional situation is quite stable, and I don't live in a place where weather events are a threat.

Last year, I fell into r/collapse and the doom and gloom videos on youtube about these subjects. I got very anxious, had imminent catastrophe thoughts. I had days where I feared my kids would , one day,resent me for having them.

But three things happened to me.

1. I discovered [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org) and it helped me understand that humanity has, arguably, never been in a better shape.There will always be a war, or a disease epidemic to look at, but the trends are very encouraging.
2. I discovered that polar bears and bee populations are not decreasing and that the earth is greening. I know that probably there are more bad than good news about the environment, but I found that good news were muted (for example, UK emitted more CO2 in 1900 than it did in 2018). I'm very rational and I like to hear both sides of the story. This helps me have a balanced look at the subject.
3. I discovered that the countries that do the best about CO2 emissions are those where there is hydro and/or nuclear power. Solar and wind might be great one day but what they do now is increase the need for natural gas and they drive the kWh price up. I'm quite progressive, I think a carbon tax is already a burden for the working class people, so increasing electricity prices because of renewable energy looks very unjust.

I also got help from a psychologist.

But in the end:

\- I think that a ""malthusian catastrophe"" is very unlikely in the next decades

\- Climate is going to be a problem in the second half of the 21st century if business as usual goes on, but if we choose the **already existing** technologies (it's not wishful thinking) i.e. nuclear power, the EV, and crispr/GM for crops, mitigation and adaptation are going to be feasible.

\- I beware of people who are the most alarmist about the environment, and of people who refuse to embrace technological solutions. They are often the same people.

Our main hope is enough people in the western world finally see what is happening so we can do something about it, but most of us (myself included until recently, regretabally) only think in the next year, 5 years, 10 max. Most are worried about bills, taking care of their family, personal goals, fining love, personally exciting things, and have heard global warming so long that to them it is ""boy who cried wolf"" and ""we'll tech our way out of it"". Also have heard from friends ""well unless everyone does it we'll fail, so what's the point? We're just x amount of people"" (so frustrated with that one)

I honestly don't know what it will take for people to finally see the true situation that we are in. Maybe the first true drought in the west that they may go hungry, maybe when a major city has to be abandoned due to sea rise.

But, on the positive side, renewables are coming on strong, India and China seem to be taking things seriously as the biggest and rapidly growing nations, on the Democrat side (usa) climate change is one of the highest concerns to some polls, even some Republicans seem ready to at least try something (if it amounted more to jack squat i'd be shocked personally but gotta get that boulder moving). There is extension rebellion, climate offensive and sunrise movement creating waves, some companies are seeing what is coming and preparing to go more green. Carbon sequestering and capture is making progess (still need to go to 0 emissions though), electric cars are slowly becoming mainstream. So there is hope.

Me? I gotta do what I can and lead by example in a very anti-green area of the US (not an easy adjustment). I really hope we can get out ahead and be prepared but also think it'll be equally likely we'll have to throw some hail mary's and try some geoengineering to try to save ourselves.

Agreed.  But it would take more than kindness.  Even with your generous timeline the process would be impossibly difficult to plan and coordinate.  We've known for decades but we have yet to take meaningful action.

Overall, it’s better to have a positive bias than a negative one.  But ideally, we ought to base our judgment on logic and rationality—rather than on hope, or a relentless longing for change.  There are many situations in which a realistic acceptance of a possibly, or likely, negative outcome is more beneficial than clinging to a hope counter to what is quite probably going to happen.  It is unpleasant to face our problems, but the longer we wait the harder it gets.  

People do make small sacrifices all the time, but it isn't enough.  12 years is an artificial deadline, but so is a millennium.  We need to have both short term and long term goals to build a sustainable culture and civilization.  The limits of the environment are not negotiable, and certain changes need to be prioritized.

It's not as bad as the near-term-human-extinction people say.

How bad exactly it ends up being depends enormously on human decisions around greenhouse gas emissions.  No change is not an option anymore, but we've got a huge amount of power to make the difference between a little bit worse than now, and a lot worse.

Yes, talking to people is important.  Do that.  It works better if you join with others -- talking with people is a skill, and it can be taught and learned.    Individual action isn't sufficient either -- the end goal of that talking is a political outcome.

It's a difficult dialogue to strike, but I figured this community - out of any on reddit - would provide what I was looking for, and I'm left more impressed than I expected to be; the detail of many of the responses here can help inform future academic research/best practices. 

&#x200B;

To sum up the key points I found here:

*  A lot of folks face unmitigated cognitive dissonance: They desire stopping ""business as usual"" behaviours, but lack the personal resources accomplish their ""checking-out"" of our fast work/consume/work/consume/work/consume culture. Some degree of hypocrisy and incongruence between our beliefs and behaviours is inevitable. On top of that discomfort, failure here implies death or at least immense harm  endured over the next few decades. 
*  In psychology, we ought to treat depression and we ought to treat anxiety, in most cases: So often, thesy stem from irrational or even rational but solveable  problems in our lives. The current paradigms in psychology (emphasizing the person's welfare over the person's role in a community/group effort) is inherently at odds with what needs to be done to minimize harm from anthropogenic climate change. By (current) design, mental healthcare is not well equipped for this problem.
* Philosophy and thanatology provide good insight, but climate change is an unprecedented issue, especially for psychology. How we humans deal with a species-wide existential threat is unprecedented. More work needs to be done to effectively transition something like grief counseling, for example, from a ""how does this effect the individual"" to ""how does this effect the community/species as a whole. How is one person dying different from everyone dying, psychologically?
* Finding personal meaning in one's life is critical. The most fundamental aspects of humanity; finding love, finding beauty, and finding a meaningful way to spend our days, are more relevant than ever.
* Acceptance of the world and its dismal future is necessary, and understandably, one of the greatest hurdles to get over.","2019-05-01 02:41:58","3","BlPlN","1747789555.826761","climate anxiety","manual"
"em79eq0","t3_biyend","biyend","collapse","skeptical","No matter how people identify religiously, everyone deserves adequate mental health services in the face of collapse.  The Secular Therapy Project is an important organization that connects non-religious folks to therapists.  Many secularists, atheists, humanists, and other non-religious people complain that they have great difficulty finding mental health  professionals who are secular.  While being religious in no way means  someone cannot be a good therapist, far too many therapists integrate or insert spiritual, religious or New Age ideas into therapy, even when they know their client is not religious.  This is not only offensive to those who wish to distance themselves from supernatural solutions to real life problems, but unethical.  Many private religious universities are graduating psychologists, counselors, and social workers who have a religious agenda and all too often seek to steer people back into religion.  Courts have even been known to refer people to so-called  “Christian Counseling"" centers because of a lack of awareness of nearby  secular resources. In small or rural communities, even when there are  secular resources available, often they are often not easily identified, as too many therapists must stay closeted or risk losing large amounts  of business and referrals.

Children in particular, are often unable to voice their concerns and anxieties and their preferences for mental health services.  They have access to unlimited content on collapse topics from total amateur to expert presentations, at least until some massive storm destroys their city.  I would love to see mental health experts visiting schools to talk with classes of students about what they're experiencing.  Most (not all) students and parents would rather that we provide teens with mental health services than a bunch of armed guards.  I agree with some of the recent dialogue about how tech is pretty well correlated to rising rates of depression in teens, but it seems to me that Jonathan Haidt and others have overlooked climate and collapse anxiety.","2019-05-01 04:45:23","2","Klowdhi","1747789555.832812","climate anxiety","manual"
