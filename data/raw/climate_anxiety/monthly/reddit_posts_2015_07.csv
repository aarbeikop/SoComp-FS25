"3e8mdn","environment","emotional","Dealing with hopelessness that comes with familiarity with climate science","Hi fellow redditors. I'm new to this subreddit but recently climate change has become a really important issue to me, going from awareness of the problem as a teen to actually causing me anxiety now as a 25 year old stay at home dad of two. My girlfriend and I are actually contemplating moving from FL as much of the state will be dealing with flooding and unreasonable temperatures within the next 40 years. Do any of you have any advice as to how to stay hopeful and not let climate issues get to you?","2015-07-22 20:15:39","0","4","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3e8mdn/dealing_with_hopelessness_that_comes_with/","True","Stray_Bobkatt","1747752279.1072278","climate anxiety","manual"
