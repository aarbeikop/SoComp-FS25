I think our only chance to turn things around in time is to completely change from our 1%-controlled exploitive culture to an egalitarian-cooperative culture, as described by Riane Eisler's [Cultural Transformation Theory](http://www.partnershipway.org/about-cps/foundational-concepts/cultural-transformation). But even progressives won't mobilize, because we're all in [climate change denial of the double reality](http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/Nogaard_Understanding%20Climate%20Denial.pdf) sort.","2015-08-04 18:35:06","4","HumanistRuth","1747752938.279579","climate anxiety","manual"
"ctrs2lj","t3_3fryc6","3fryc6","climate","scientific","It all feels extremely immediate when you learn that things are far, far worse than you thought. Every year I experience some new sense of fear and terror that everything is lost. The thing is though, these things won't materialize overnight, so that immediate anxiety fades over time, but the depression is different, also very insidious. Some say that it is the correct thing to feel, seeing as we are watching ourselves ruin the short term habitability of our entire planet. You can decide to have optimism, as ecomodernists have. If you want optimism, look up the Ecomodernist Manifesto. Otherwise, you just sort of have to live life with that knowledge in mind. I'm even younger than you, and so I imagine my life is going to filled with turmoil as well, but I'm at least going to try to have a good time until then. The worst thing to do for yourself right now though is to get further into the doomer side, Guy McPherson and the like. It makes sense since things are so dire Inyour mind, but ultimately it is hinged on a lot of faulty logic and interpretations of news articles. 

If you are looking for ways of learned optimism, I would recommend the book, Active Hope by Joanna Macy, it truly helped me.","2015-08-05 00:46:19","4","LegendsOfChange","1747752938.282742","climate anxiety","manual"

"cts1ra9","t3_3fryc6","3fryc6","climate","scientific","I work to bring about global socialism, because [it is the only possible solution](https://jiminykrix.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/the-ecocide-at-the-heart-of-capitalism/). My fight to do this involves struggling alongside people who already face problems and being of whatever assistance I can in the work of solving these problems and building power in their communities.

People are already suffering, and have been for a very long time, and the world is overall a much less fulfilling, nurturing, or interesting a world than it would be if this weren't the case. Because there is poverty, there is crime. Because of the necessity of controlled reproduction of a labor force (and other reasons), there is the domination of women and the oppression of all non-men and non-gender-conforming people. Because there is colonialism (which is fundamentally a political-economic phenomenon), there is racism. Because of all this, the world is filled with deeply fucked-up people, both victims and perpetrators of these horrific social mechanics, and cheap, unsustainable thrills to soothe the majority of us. What person even of substantial privilege wouldn't at the very least have nerves just living in the same global society as all of that? I am deeply alienated by our world, and its misery enters my life on a daily basis, and the way to reduce my alienation and sadness is to work to change it. I believe socialism is the only way to resolve these problems, because the problems are, at their deepest root, a function of our economic system. 

So I was already delighted to have found a way to serve humanity as a way of also working against my own alienation in this shitty world, but it turns out that it's not only the well-being of the billions who are already suffering on the line (and that of billions to come after them if we don't end capitalism)--it is actually everyone's life, even the whole species' life--on the line due to climate change, so I have all the reason to work harder.

That's what gives my life meaning and gives me the will to fight, along with the relationships I make with people I meet, love, befriend, and work with as I do this work, and even a love for all life.","2015-08-05 06:11:31","2","jiminykrix","1747752938.28828","climate anxiety","manual"
"cts4sns","t3_3fryc6","3fryc6","climate","scientific",">Everywhere I look, it just seems like we've lost the fight already and are doomed.

We are but in order to stay sane, cut back on personal emissions significantly, only vote for politicians with effective mitigation strategies ie not Ms Clinton :) Engage with peers and friends on reducing and build some resilience into were you live in case it goes bad more quickly and suddenly than anticipated. eg if you live in Miami, move.

At least you'll know you did your bit and aren't part of the cabal of deniers, lukewarmers and hypocrites who make up >90% of the population not giving a fuck.","2015-08-05 09:13:31","2","Capn_Underpants","1747752938.290522","climate anxiety","manual"
"ctsjp4c","t3_3fryc6","3fryc6","climate","scientific","Very similar position here, age 30. I won't prescribe anything, just my own view for myself:

I think it increasingly likely, if not inevitable now, that I will see catastrophic global collapse in my lifetime.

I was going to die anyway. It's like finding out that you are going to die of cancer. You knew you would die. Now you just know the cause and the doctor's best guess on life expectancy. It wasn't like you weren't going to die, it's just been brought to the fore.

Maybe you were going to die from diabetes, but now it's a super-hurricane. Maybe you were going to die after decades of dementia, but now it's a massive flood.

All species we know go extinct eventually. The one's alive now, including ours, just haven't gone extinct yet. Now we know how it's going to end. The fear, worry, anxiety, grief, is simply due to the surprise. It's not like our happiness was really wrapped up in the *indefiniteness* of life or civilization.

Believing this (all of this) was going to go on forever, was simply a false belief, a false belief we never really questioned.

Once you accept that, then all you have left is all you ever had: this day to be the best human being you can be, regardless of outcome or consequence. Be excellent, be kind, be generous, be noble, be just, be courageous--without regard to outcome. Focus on what you have power to do, release what you never had any power over.

This is how I handle it.","2015-08-05 17:46:38","2","[deleted]","1747752938.2933109","climate anxiety","manual"
"ctrh5vs","t3_3fryc6","3fryc6","climate","scientific","Here is one of only two articles I ever share from Guy McPherson's site. I don't worry about NTE or extinction at all since extinction is the fate of all species and part of the cycle of this blue planet. I guess I worry about the hell leading up to the continuing collapse of civilization. Mostly I worry about the suffering of my family, especially the younger ones.

And it's going to get much worse before it gets better. Hell, the GOP may even take the White House in 2016.

But... When I was your age (I'm 50 now) I lived under the threat that the Soviet Union and United States would annihilate each other in a thermonuclear exchange. Talk about environmental destruction! And I certainly had nightmares about it.

Have things gotten better? Yes, but dangers persist. There is going to be an outcome of all of this, this enormous change to Earth and civilization. You'll just have to steel yourself for it and work for the best outcome you can. (As am I; old as I am I expect to see wrenching change in my lifetime).

There's a Buddhist saying along the lines of  ""If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present."" Do what you can to live more in the present!

And never give up. There are a lot of people out there who are wrong and they have to be opposed.","2015-08-05 00:36:46","3","wainstead","1747753071.2954829","climate anxiety","manual"
