Probably you will experience more summer heat, and thunderstorms may have more punch, but most likely nothing will happen during your lifetime that spells ""I don't want to live on this planet anymore"". 

Boon and bane, our lifespan is limited.  Outlook for future generations will bring new challenges, some huge, but also new opportunities.  It's left for every generation to find their own answers.  And undoubtedly, they will. Trust in humankind, we're a tenacious bunch clinging to life. ","2018-10-10 09:46:31","16","nosleepatall","1747783641.6842308","climate anxiety","manual"
"e7tof7c","t3_9mxhq0","9mxhq0","climatechange","action-oriented","I'll probably get downvoted for this, but I mean what I'm saying and I mean it in the best way possible. 

Humanity LARGELY is probably fucked in the near term (100 to 200 years).   Not literally every human, but certainly billions.   The fact is, as I understand it, we are ALREADY in a massive extinction event.   That isn't going to improve with the changing climate - it is going to get worse.   Most  (5 out of 6, or so) of the previous mass extinction events were due to climate change, as I understand it.   

Will people be willing to make the changes needed IN TIME to avert disaster?   If I were a betting man (I'm not, but if I were..), I'd bet NO WAY.   I've known people with health problems who went to the doctor and the doctor said: give up sugar, or you are going to get diabetes.   Give up alcohol, or you are going to die of liver failure.   Most of the time, people just keep doing what they are doing, and they die needlessly early.   This is the same problem on a global scale.   The doctor is the multitude of elite climate scientists, and they are saying ""you are all fucked if we can't pull it together.""   A significant subset of our population in USA is convinced that these climate scientists are part of a liberal plot to try to control what kind of lightbulbs you can buy.   They truly do not believe the climate is changing, or the few that do believe it is changing do not acknowledge that humanity has anything to do with it.   

There is little reason for optimism.  (Zero reason, IMO).   

That said, PROBABLY most of us won't see anywhere near the worst of this stuff in our lifetimes.   We'll see problems increasing, and it may impact some of us (some more than others).   But for us, personally, it probably is not dire.   You can live your life.  

I would suggest that you have to find meaning and purpose OUTSIDE of this sort of large scale outcome.   It's truly an existential problem.   But as others here point out, THAT IS ALWAYS THE CASE.   We are all going to die.   The Earth is going to get swallowed by the sun in a few billion years.   The Universe is likely going to keep expanding, everything drifting further apart, and finally burning itself out.   There is no hope for humanity's permanent survival.   Just as there is no hope for our individual survival.   That is true whether or not we miraculously solve the problem of climate change.   So to make your mental well being dependent on that outcome is to set yourself at odds against reality itself.   That's a battle you won't win!  :)

I consider myself very much like you - super high on empathy.   I also have high anxiety and have suffered depression in the past (thankfully not now!).   You have to try to re-frame your existence and find meaning and value in other ways.   While you and I and most of us here cannot meaningfully impact the future of climate change and humanity and so on, we can be beneficial and helpful and good.   We can do good and meaningful things.   It's up to you to figure out how!   I wish you the best with it.

Consider that maybe you should tune out from the news for awhile until you find your footing again.   Otherwise, focus on what you CAN do - not on what you CAN'T do.

Best of luck.","2018-10-15 19:06:33","5","ILoveKombucha","1747783641.691921","climate anxiety","manual"

Three quarters of global human land use is for animal agriculture. Lab grown meat will be in restaurants, by late 2018. The only reason conventional meat can be sold for low prices today is because of agricultural subsidies and a government that allows meat producers to pass on their negative externalities to the rest of us.

Lab-grown meat currently makes up 0% of the global human diet.

""Can.""

>Self driving cars can reduce the number of cars needed on the road by 99%, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. A 90% reduction of vehicles in operation would reduce our overall emissions by 15.9%. Fatalities in traffic can be reduced by 99% through self-driving cars, so insurance costs for human driven cars will go up dramatically. The average car is used just 4% of the time. Most people will have no reason to own a car again. The safety created by self-driving cars and prohibition of human drivers creates a positive feedback loop, as people living in big cities become willing to walk or ride their bicycle. If your groceries are delivered to you and you work from home, why would you want to own a car?

""Can"". Do you think the Earth even has the natural resources to *replace its entire vehicle fleet*, much less do so in an economical amount of time? 

>One kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide. The Great Barrier reef perishes because people are unwilling to do the patently obvious: Add sulfur particles to jet fuel for airplanes flying over the Great Barrier reef, when weather predictions suggest large temperature rises lie ahead. Humans have removed sulfur pollution from the air, but sulfur placed in strategic positions helps avert the worst effects of global warming.

>Seaweed production has grown 50% in the past ten years. Global seaweed production has more than doubled between 2000 and 2014, from 10.5 to 28.4 million tonnes. Seaweed sequesters carbon dioxide, sequesters pollution by nitrates, reduces local ocean acidification and decreases local temperature. Demand for seaweed still dramatically exceeds supply. Seaweed produces nutrition and shelter for fish, when seaweed is grown, fish numbers increase too. Seaweed cultivation consists of creating attachment points in the ocean, in places where almost no life grows because of the absence of such attachment points. Rather than competing with existing ecosystems, seaweed cultivation gives birth to new ecosystems.

And? Seaweed also makes up an infinitesimally small part of the global human diet. Seaweed production could increase 5000% and it would mean fuck all for the stability of the global food system.

>Global bivalve production from aquaculture has consistently increased over the years from 7.1 million mt in 1995 to 11.9 million mt in 2005, an average increase of 6.8% annually during the period. Aquacultures contribution of bivalves to the overall bivalve production increased from 72.8% in 1993 to 87.3% in 2005. Eating more than 100 gram of shellfish per week reduces risk of a heart attack by 60%. Shellfish production continues to increase enormously around the world. The shellfish consume large amounts of algae in the water, thereby reducing eutrophication. Shellfish production is at risk of ocean acidification, but through combined growing of seaweed and shellfish in the same area, this risk is effectively addressed.

I don't know why you think looking at some minuscule fraction of the human diet and showing how its growing means anything for collapse or agriculture. Unless you're suggesting that we can abandon the vast tracts of chemically fertilized farmland we depend on for our survival and start eating shellfish and mushrooms -- and you haven't presented any quantitative evidence that any of these alternative food sources could actually feed the planet -- then this point is a red herring.

>Global mushroom production increased over 12% annually during the period from 1981 to 1997 and continues to increase to this day. Mushroom cultivation uses 99% less space than beef, to produce the same amount of protein. Mushrooms are cultivated on agricultural waste products.

Uh, no. Mushrooms don't have anywhere close to the calories or protein content that beef or any other conventional food does. An ounce of mushrooms has 0.6 grams of protein. An ounce of beef has 6 grams of protein. That's an order of magnitude difference. I have no idea where you're getting your information.

>Point 1, 6,7 and 8 effectively illustrate why we won't have an agricultural crisis, because we are transitioning to sustainable alternatives at an amazing pace. Half of global food production is currently wasted, according to the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In case of a sudden food shock, price signals would flow back to consumers and consumers would have to reduce their waste of products. As governments change their subsidy policies towards agriculture, price signals will change human diets towards healthier proportions.

No. *Every single one* of your points about food production looks at ""niche"" products and ""cool"" stories (like lab grown meat) while totally, completely, and absolutely ignoring virtually every aspect of the quantitative elephant in the room in terms of actually feeding the people we have. You don't address our actual global food needs in a single one of your obscure and mostly off-topic points about exotic food production.

Not only do you not refute the possibility of a global food crisis, your meandering list of irrelevant factoids fails to address it at all. You're ignoring the problem 100%.

>
No serious climatologists predict that positive feedback loops will come to dominate anthropogenic global warming within this century. Guy McPherson is entirely at odds with the scientific consensus.

Climate change will be absolutely devastating even without these positive feedback loops. Another red herring.
