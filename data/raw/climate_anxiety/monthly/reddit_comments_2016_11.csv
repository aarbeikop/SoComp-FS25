It's myopic though, and doesn't really flow logically since if he acknowledges what we do has significant impact on the world's climate, then he also has to accept that even though trees would be growing *slightly* faster, this pales in comparison to the other ways in which change will take place.

So he's not a denier per se, he's just another guy who got paid to cast doubts on science in order to discredit a reality that's going to cost some fossil fuel interests a LOT of money.","2016-11-12 20:20:51","1","pmnsuphafly","1747762987.326566","climate anxiety","manual"
