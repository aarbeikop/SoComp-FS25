It is scary and overwhelming but seeing how much you as one lutson can do, will help. Keep focused on the steps right ahead of you rather than focusing on imaginary futures to freak out about.","2019-10-04 10:09:02","7","[deleted]","1747793222.464457","climate anxiety","manual"

It sucks but thats the deal you got right now. YOU are strong dont be scared. I have a 3 and a 5 year old and never planed on having kids but here i go 48 and makin a move. Got a old fixer upper house and we are just livin life and doing all we can hopin it will somehow be enough. 

Thats where it stops. I know it sounds bad but we are not screwed as we think. Its bad but we gotta act swift and fast. World wide movement. Talkin bout all hands on deck time to clean up our earth. If your on this rock your in. Shut down everything untill its done. Thats a bold statement i know but your thoughts and panics are justified. I feel very nervous about our survival as well. You can we can. We all have to.

Think of this place that we all share, if we wreck it l, its history. Then its to late to care.","2019-10-04 05:17:25","8","themighty351","1747793222.4676201","climate anxiety","manual"

"f2ehstf","t3_dcy28n","dcy28n","climatechange","action-oriented","You feel anxious because you feel helpless. You feel like there's nothing you can do to sway the course of things, that you're just reacting to events. You need to be proactive to feel in control.

The most proactive thing you can do is to extract yourself from the system, because it's a systemic problem. It's not easy to do entirely, but try to take small steps towards living less through the financial structures that are causing climate change. 


- Grow/cook/bake as much of your own food as you can, when you buy it buy organic and local.
- Buy as little as you can from major corporations
- Buy second hand as much as possible.  
- Barter where possible
- Avoid buying anything that comes in disposable packaging 
- Take public transport, walk or ride whenever possible, reconsider the need to fly or drive places.
- Try to stay out of debt
- Build your local community, make friends, share things locally, get involved in a local currency.


All of theses things have the benefit of making you more resilient in a crisis and weakening the system that is the problem. Climate Change is already happening and you're not dead yet. It will affect different places, in different ways and at a different times, even then not everyone will always be affected.

Protesting is well and good. It brings attention to the issue, which is important, but it's difficult to protest against a system that you are dependent upon.","2019-10-04 13:27:59","3","[deleted]","1747793222.473741","climate anxiety","manual"

65 million years ago, something very very very very very very large hit our planet and killed almost everything

I just think if our ancestors survived that craziness there's a good chance we can survive our own craziness.

"f2e82hn","t3_dcy28n","dcy28n","climatechange","action-oriented","Humans are extremely adaptable.  You too!  

I don't know how old you are, but I was 20 during Y2K.  It was a couple years of anxiety, but nothing happened; probably bc people responded to the anxiety and fixed most of the systems in advance.  Being 40 now, I've lived through a few end-of-the-world predictions and so far nothing.  So glad I never let those fears control my life.

People will adapt and life will continue for at least a few more generations.  We'll likely have a lower quality of life, but that doesn't mean we can't be joyful.  People who've had a major loss in life (permanent injury, job loss) will grieve the loss for awhile, but most eventually return to their normal  emotional state.  Do not live in perpetual fear of the loss!  Think of our ancestors, who lived much tougher and lost half their kids before adulthood.  Epidemics and accidents meant no one could say they'd be alive next year with any certainty.  Did they give up?  No.  The will the survive was central in their lives and they focused on their hopes, not their losses. You will too.

You're living like a PTSD sufferer.  They're so focused on waiting for the next hit to come, that it's a relief when something finally happens and they can finally just deal with it and feel better about it not being the worst case.

The goal of climate change anxiety is to be worried enough to make changes, but not so fearful we give up.  

""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst."". Imagine your life in two scenarios.  The worst, you're dead, The best, technology saves us and life continues.  How to prepare for each?  If you're going to die, you should enjoy today to the maximum, because you'll feel nothing when you're dead.  If you live, you'll be glad you prepared for your future.  None of those scenarios are best served by depression.

Edit:. Apparently this is the wrong sub-reddit to be discussing managing one's anxiety in a productive way.  OP, no one on this thread is a denialist, but it appears too many want to be focusing only on the debate.  I suggest you ask your question in a mental health related sub-reddit.","2019-10-04 10:44:02","1","TheSparkHasRisen","1747793222.483396","climate anxiety","manual"

Try this experiment: stay away from any media and social media consumption use for a couple of weeks. Very quickly your actual issues and imbalances will resurface and eco stuff will totally vanish from your focus.

People with solid and intense private lives use the same media you do but they do it for entertainment purposes only and their private life protects them from taking all the public bullshit and the scare mongering too seriously. People with private issues however seek solutions or at least distraction in the public sphere but they have no protection when the permanent scare mongering slowly creeps into their whole life.","2019-10-04 11:28:48","0","Feldheld","1747793222.486948","climate anxiety","manual"

Its quack science interpolated from 39 data points (1980-2019 satellite data).

The models predicting the future are super advanced vector calculus based on wrong data and tweaked to have an upward trend.

Nothing is happening and the scientific bodies need more funding and have sunk to the lowest level. Alarmism.

It's entirely possible to affect outcome here -- we've got a mix of technologies available to us which will allow an end to fossil fuel consumption.  But whether we do so or not is a political question: it comes down to whether enough people, in enough countries, get involved in pressuring their government, in a country-appropriate manner, to create the political will for action.

First and foremost, I want to point out that I hate the fact that you have to preface your post the way you did, due to today's culture on discussing topics like this. It's no wonder we are so incapable of making decisions on a societal level when we can't even have a calm and level headed conversation about difficult topics without it inevitably devolving into a shouting match.

I am personally hopeful. I have looked at the IPCC reports for the different outcomes based on different levels of action that we take and that coupled with the current #FridaysForFuture climate strikes and the general waking up of people around the world that I have seen in the news recently, I believe we have a chance at making a difference. I frequently visit [r/ClimateActionPlan](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/) to try and find some good news. I just saw the other day that LA is planning to plant 90,000 trees by 2021. I also saw that scientists mapped out several areas where we can plant trees today and they discovered that it has the potential to capture 2/3 of all the carbon emitted since the beginning of the industrial revolution. I try to take all of this with a grain of salt, of course. And I definitely look at all of these options as being a single option in an overall greater list of things we need to do simultaneously, but I think we have reason for hope.","2019-10-07 17:39:00","1","ModestMariner","1747793378.5133939","climate anxiety","manual"
