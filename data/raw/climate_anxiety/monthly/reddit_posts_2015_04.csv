"31hpvd","climatechange","action-oriented","Is Kelvin the big Elephant in the room?","A few weeks ago NOAA published a report announcing that the pacific is officially in an El Nino, which is a climatic phenomena that has occurred naturally from time to time. This phenomena is characterized by surface ocean temperatures above normal stretching across the equatorial pacific. However,  buried in their report is a subsurface anomaly of +6C centered at a depth of 150m having a height (+3C window) of 100m and stretching across an area of some 2,000km x 1,000km, centered along the equator from 130W-  170E longitude as you can see from this graph published in their report. That’s a volume of some 200,000 cubic kilometers of anomalous warm water.

Subsurface temperature anomalies are called Kelvin waves. The amount of energy represented by this anomaly is equivalent to 4.2 million Terawatt hours of energy; enough to “hide” all of the CO2 warming and arctic amplification seen within the last year. I’m personally not an expert in Kelvin waves but from the reading I’ve done, a +6C anomaly is unusual. For example, in this report that describes Kelvin waves, the scale only goes to +3C.

As this summer unfolds, some of the heat from this anomaly will reach the surface and accelerate cyclones when they form, causing increased anxiety among those who believe that climate change is having a significant impact today, and give the victims of these increasing disasters as place to point their finger. Others who deny climate change will likely say that all of this is normal. Are Kelvin waves getting bigger? Are they changing in where they begin and end? If the nature of the Kelvin wave is changing, why don’t we talk about it more?
