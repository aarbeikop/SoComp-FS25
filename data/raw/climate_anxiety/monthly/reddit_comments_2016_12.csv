"dbu8idt","t3_5laam9","5laam9","climate","scientific","Nothing is meaningless unless you surrender the right to give meaning to your life anf your work. Even as the Titanic was sinking, there were those who played music. Couples who died in the Upstairs Lounge fire were found lying prone together, holding one another.  People who were on that United Flight that crashed in Pennsylvania in 2001 didnt think they were going to make it either. Knowing they weren't going to escape, they chose to offer comfort to others and likely themselves as well. This sort of thing happens more often than you might think.

But here's the good news: it's most likely not that bad yet.  Human civilization *will* go through some rough days between now and 2100, but total civilizational collapse on a global scale is unlikely.  The problem with climate change is also its saving grace: it is a slow-progressing disaster. Cities will not generally become uninhabitable overnight, with places like New Orleans after their next direcrt hit being exceptions to the rule. We *will* have difficulty with crops and with numbers of refugees like the world has never seen before, but these are still not impossible problems. Russia was decimated by World War II and yet still exists.  So was much of Europe, for that matter.

Our quest for technologies to mitigate change proceeds unabated. We will have the technology to build a soletta (a giant solar shade) that alone could dampen climate change significantly within just a few decades. This is in no way a solution, but it would give us more time and the ability to alleviate *some* of the negative effects of climate change. (Ocean acidification being one that this stop-gap would *not* alleviate.)

You can take the attitude that this will not matter since you will eventually die, but that misses the point of living: all organisms eventually die. Our lives are not defined by how and when they end but by what we did before that end point, who we loved, how we ***lived***.

I get your existential dread. I really do. Mine paralyzes me as well some days. But mine is a symptom of my depression and anxiety. It's a symptom of the disease and my friends help me fight it when I ask them. You should figure out ways to get out and see the world and maybe even attempt to help others.

The collapse isn't only the climate, but the monetary, energy, and shipping sectors of the economy are unlikely to survive what's coming without lethal interruptions in services.

However, hope is not lost!  The local changes you've started will be part of your survival strategy.  It's very unlikely we'll prevent 4 degC warming and multi meter sea rise; and it'll happen faster than people will adapt.  Without fossil fuels for industrial agriculture the carrying capacity of the planet may be much lower than there current population, or at the least massive migration and career changes will be necessary.

So from outside the environmental side, just do what makes you happy, take your mind off the bigger picture.


I have also been worried about the existential crisis we face with climate change, so I went out and found something I could do about it that impacts other people. I worked for a year with a climate non profit fundraising to fund a carbon tax, this made me feel like I mattered towards the fight. I have since leaving that job begun working for a solar company doing sales. This has made me feel like I am really making a huge difference. Every time I close a sale, I know I am one person closer to combating carbon pollution. I don't even look at this as a job, but as my duty to the world, and to others, as a way to continue to cut pollution and look for a greener future. I am not a salesman, I am a climate combatant, selling people a sustainable future for us all.

"dbu8r6p","t3_5laam9","5laam9","climate","scientific","I read a great book by Dr. Dean Ornish recently (Love & Survival - 8 Pathways to Intimacy and Health), where he describes going through an existential crisis when he was 19 - too young and immature to handle it. He almost committed suicide, had to drop out of university despite being a very driven individual, and moved back in with his parents. 

He says he was far too young to handle the thought of the world going to hell and that, ultimately, nothing he does matters. That is, we all die, and so what's the point? 

What got him through it were a few things, but mainly the wisdom from some Eastern traditions, I think Buddhist in nature, especially *talking with* wiser, older people who had accepted life as it was. I encourage you to seek out such teachers, whatever their background. It's easy to reason ourselves into a 'life is meaningless' or other fear-based downward spiral, and if we don't have the means to handle it, suicide seems like the only way out. It is not.

Ornish went on to become extremely successful and happy. I have recently gone through a similar crisis with regard to climate change, but thanks to being 55, in a solid marriage, and having gained some life wisdom along the way, I found it overwhelming only for a time. I am now getting back into the climate fight and I managed to largely enjoy life even through the crisis.

You are very worried about the collapse of civilization and are contemplating suicide over it.

But I realized something, there's no hope but what we make for ourselves and life gives us nothing but what we pry from its hands. It's our duty to future generations and to our ancestors to fight off the end of civilization as long as possible so we have to stick around now and fight for it. 

You're doing pretty much everything you can in terms of habits of practices but if you want to do more then convincing deniers is the number one way to do it.

Your own emotional state is your own, the thoughts you allow to run through your mind affect it.  Meditation can teach you to control your thoughts and therefore give you control over your emotional state.

You are alive the odds of being alive now are very slim -> http://www.businessinsider.com/infographic-the-odds-of-being-alive-2012-6?IR=T

And most people only have about 29,915 days (about 71 years on average).

You could be going through the 5 stages of grief (DABDA) in which case it sounds like your in the Depression phase -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model

Good news you're nearly through the woods of climate change DABDA, next is acceptance and what the hell, I can only look out for myself and significant others.

"danjrr0","t3_5fw2uw","5fw2uw","collapse","skeptical","> Everything is going to end soon. Climate change has absolutely sucked all joy out of life. I look around me and all I see is death.

Not for the first world. This week, this month, next year, the next 5 years - the next 10, the next 50... in the first world countries we're going to be fine for your entire life.

Sure the global news will get worse, but we'll be shielded for most of it.

Meaning - not trying for a career right now, putting off doing things you wanted to do because ""Whats the point"".... the point is as it's always been - to live life.

There's a strong chance you'll need to go to college, get on a career path, pay taxes, and so on - without much derailing that journey through life.

Worst case scenario is you have nothing saved and nothing to fall back on if times get tough if you don't work now. But on the bright side - people living in war torn countries tend to not have our ""black reflection of life"" we get. Simply getting through a day triggers their reward pathways, and makes life meaningful for them.

So there's that to look forward to! ""Today I saved my kid from a bear, beat raiders to death with my spoon, and found a secret cache of food! Today I was awesome!""

Rather than ""I got up, did work that is pointless in a job I hate, and came home to bed exhausted.""","2016-12-01 13:36:33","4","SarahC","1747763960.997076","climate anxiety","manual"

You're the one living in a fucking dream world. Because I know it happens, it happens!""

And I don't disagree with you, we're all pretty much doomed, and soon.

But I take that fact and do the opposite of what you do...I feel relief, not anxiety. If day to day life gets me anxious for whatever reason, I just remember that none of it will matter - very, very soon. There are no long-term consequences anymore. 

And it's easy to look at the bright side...whatever years we have left, we have access to the most amazing technology every created. The sum total of all human knowledge is at your fingertips. And at least you don't live in the Middle Ages, or in a part of the world that has already collapsed.

I guess what I'm saying is it's all about your attitude. Sure the world is ending...but I feel fine. ""That's great it starts with an earthquake, birds snakes and aero planes...""

Yup, ""life is a bitch and then you die.""

Fortunately, for the species but often unfortunately for the individual we are endowed with a genetic will to live.

So, I reckon that each of us must make the best of this inheritance or pack it in.

We're all suffering here, Bubba.  Each of us probably has some little intellectual fantasy that keeps us from checking out mentally or physically.  Find yours and hang on.  Hey, the Universe may have a plan for you - don't count it out quite yet.
