"a3i7zl","environment","emotional","How should I make my restaurant business more sustainable? Thoughts, ideas, criticism welcome!","Hello r/Environment!

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** I own a hamburger restaurant but recognize how detrimental beef is to the climate. I'm expanding the business to a larger city with a more liberal population, and want to implement a more sustainable approach to the business without scaring away meat-loving customers. Along with offering plant-based garden burgers, using recycled and biodegradable containers / utensils (which we already do), I'd like to offer plant-based meats like the Impossible Burger or Beyond Meat. The idea is not to just appeal to vegans, but to use our successful establishment to educate meat-lovers on more sustainable options and invite them to consider trying these products without inducing guilt which would discourage them from doing business with us. There are cultural / political barriers on this issue which I hope to break through by taking a ""middle ground"" approach; We'll implementing Meatless Mondays (discounted plant-based burgers), and a pledge of donating 50% of corporate profits to land conservation non-profit organizations (NPOs).

&#x200B;

So, my questions for you are:

1.)  Is pledging profits to land conservation NPOs (reducing the amount of sprawl and environmental destruction) the best use if we're wanting to make an environmental impact? Would donating these funds to some other effort be more effective?

2.) As a potential customers, is this approach something you'd find meaningful enough to choose over another hamburger establishment? How could it be improved?

3.) How else can we educate and inspire without demonizing our biggest product, thus potentially causing would-be customers to feel vilified?

&#x200B;

**Important history / context:**

Though I'd barely consider myself an activist, I've been following this sub for several years (under a different account), and have always cared about the planet. My concern has grown considerably in recent years not only due to the worsening situation of the climate and the attitudes held by our current leadership, but because after starting a successful restaurant I've learned that I've been complicit in contributing to the problem!  


With the recent uptick in popularity related to gourmet burger shops, the fast casual business model (provides value to customers in terms of *convenience* and *quality*, instead of *convenience* and *price* \[fast food\]) has resulted in the rise of businesses like Shake Shack, 5 Guys, In N' Out, etc. My hometown lacked this type of dining option, and I thought I could add value in this area which lead me to start a business; [Morty's Cafe](http://mortyscafe.com)! Though we serve popular breakfast items, sandwiches, coffee, etc we're mostly known for our hamburgers. Though our burger options include 3 delicious garden burger options, they represent a small portion of our sales...

&#x200B;

You can probably see where I'm going with this. I knew beef wasn't the best thing for mother earth, but my personal anxiety sky-rocketed when I learned just how much land and water beef requires to produce. Even more troublesome was the amount of methane cows put into the atmosphere! This has caused me to seriously consider changing the business in a variety of ways...

&#x200B;

Options I've considered:

\- Providing plant-based patties ala Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat

\- Providing lab-grown meat when it becomes viable (we're still a couple years away from this)

\- Pivoting our business model to a social-cause type of approach where a portion of profits are donated to some NPO or related effort to help fight climate change

&#x200B;

These options have been weighed against the realities in the market, like the fact that most American's aren't interested in becoming vegetarians or sacrificing their love for meat even if they recognize its inherent unsustainability. 

&#x200B;

I've been really inspired by the approach taken by Patrick Brown, Stanford biochemist and founder Impossible Foods. In his interview with Vox's Ezra Klein, Brown talked about how his product was developed with meat-lovers in mind because he recognized the problem posed by our impending climate problems; Even if people understand the problem, they feel powerless in being able to do anything about it. Brown's product (in theory) allows people to enjoy the taste of meat without having to slaughter animals which contribute to the problem. 

&#x200B;

I'm about to expand the business and implement a more sustainable strategy to my business. Though it would be nice, convincing red-blooded Americans to abstain from meat is unrealistic. A substantial portion of consumers won't even consider plant-based meat, though they might try it if it were offered in a non-threatening way. My partners / investors are open to doing new, innovative things to provide value but want me to prove the concept before we implement it elsewhere throughout the company. The store I'm opening will be located in Salt Lake City which is a more affluent and liberal area than our other locales. This will hopefully make our new environmentally-aware practices more financially sustainable.

&#x200B;

So, to the point of this post: We've already switched to biodegradable straws and utensils. Next, I'd like to break through some of the cultural barriers surrounding more sustainable practices. There seems to be an unexplored ""middle-ground"" on the topic of environmentalism where a lot of progress could be made. I'd like to at very least create a space where people can become more educated (and thus familiar and open) to holistic options, without shunning those who still want to eat regular beef. We have daily specials throughout the week which have been really successful. ""Thank You Thursdays"" is our most popular day of the week. I'd like to build off this by implementing the recent ""Meatless Mondays"" movement, where non-meat options are offered at a discount. Plant-based patties (unlike our Garden Burgers) are more palatable to meat-lovers, and perhaps they'll consider trying this product. 

&#x200B;

The intent isn't just to satisfy vegans and vegetarians (since this wouldn't do much to help spur more substantial change), but to give ""regular"", omnivorous patrons the chance to try something new in an environment that isn't culturally divisive. I have no problem eating at animal-free restaurants, but plenty of meat-lovers do.   


Along with what I've just listed is the most important item I'd like feedback on; I've convinced investors it would be worth pledging 50% of corporate profits (net income, after expenses, rent, liabilities, taxes, etc. which would otherwise go to me and my investors) to land conservation non-profits like the [Bear River Land Conservatory.](http://bearriverlandconservancy.org/) These type of NPOs purchase development rights from entities which own precious land, private properties which are important to preserving historical or environmentally threatened habitats. The idea is that if customers want to eat beef they still can, and ours comes will leave you with a clearer conscience. In other words, we're implementing a self-imposed, backend tax to help curb the negative externalities associated with our most popular product. 

&#x200B;

This is different from other social cause for-profits like Tom's or Even Stevens which are more quid pro quo ex: ""Buy a pair of shoes at a marked up price, and we'll use the additional profits to give a pair of shoes to someone in need"" (Tom's), or ""Buy a sandwich at a marked up price, and we'll use the additional profits to donate a much cheaper sandwich to a local food shelter"" (Even Stevens). Instead, our offering doesn't promise a specified parcel of land per item purchased, but has a more evergreen corporate policy where the monetary sacrifice is imposed on individuals who aren't actively involved in daily work required to keep the place running.

&#x200B;

So, (again) my questions for you are:

1.)  Is pledging profits to land conservation NPOs (reducing the amount of sprawl and environmental destruction) the best use if we're wanting to make an environmental impact? Would donating these funds to some other effort be more effective?

2.) As a potential customers, is this approach something you'd find meaningful enough to choose over another hamburger establishment? How could it be improved?

3.) How else can we educate and inspire without demonizing our biggest product, thus potentially causing would-be customers to feel vilified?

"a9e1kp","collapse","skeptical","Merry Collapse-mass everyone!"," “'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.'”    J.R.R.Tolkien    

Today is Christmas day. A day that, as a child, filled me with a profound sense of wonder and excitement, (yes mainly because of childish ignorance and the presents) but also because everyone else around me in my family and culture had that same feeling, and like so much of the human experience, it was infectious. A collective agreement that this day, beyond all others, was something to get exited about. 

As I became older of course the excitement and wonder dulled, replaced by cynicism concerning the rabid commercialism that Christmas had become synonymous with, like a parasite consuming its host, leaving a void that turned the whole Christmas period into a most depressing affair. The extra joviality that is all but forced down your throat added to creating a sense that this was all a sick joke performed by the insane. A true nightmarish situation that led to many an arguments and countless hours of depressive self isolation. Not to mention the drinking that one year led to breaking both heels.

This trend looked only likely to continue, and worsen, especially with the solidifying knowledge of the coming collapse. Like a fast growing number of our planets inhabitants I was in the full throws of Climate Grief. Something I can say to be by far the worst sickness I have ever experienced. The anger, the anxiety,  the relentless depression, the complete loss of hope in all aspects of life. A place that I'm sure many reading this find themselves in, where the past becomes a foolish waste, the present becomes a distasteful joke, and the future holds only pain, disappointment, and chaos.       


First of all dear reader, I would like you to know that, if you do find these sentiments ring true with you, then you are right. You are absolutely right to think and feel these things, anyone that tells you otherwise clearly has no grasp on reality or the human condition. Everything that we have ever known, the comforts and distractions, the traditions and trappings, running water, electricity, healthcare, food delivered to your door, will at some point, be it a year or a decade, dissolve like the snow upon the mountain. Replaced by, well nothing. To pretend otherwise is to be content with a disconnect, a virtual reality akin to a blind religion. 

Like a 60 year old life long smoker, we have been given a death sentence, an undetermined amount of time, the bill, and shown the door. 

So, with all this being said, having accepted our fate, that no concrete bunker will suffice, no miracle science will present itself, and the intergalactic council simply doesn't have room or the patience for any more self harming migrants, what is there to be happy for, or even just contented about this time of year?

Well, dear reader, last year I would have given up right there. Sunken into the deep pit of despair that had become so familiar and comforting, hit the bottle and driven the screws further inwards in self destruction and self harm. Stoic in my surety of the future, armed with unshakable facts, armored by thick layers of statistics, riding high on the coat-tails of the four horsemen as they circle overhead, waiting patiently to land. 

But, somehow, something, somewhere inside me has changed. Or perhaps a more appropriate word would be, evolved. 

After four years of obsessive, uncontrollable, soul-sucking, nauseating, inconsolable Collapse Fatigue, there is only one real conclusion that I find myself left with. Something so obvious that it seems silly to commit it to a forum, especially one such as this. But the fact remains...  


Change is the only universal constant. 

The fear that has gripped me so relentlessly is that of my own mortality.

I project that mortality outwards onto countries, empires, technology, species, the ecosystem of planet Earth itself, and whilst it is clear that their destruction shall come to pass, and within my lifetime no doubt, the option of all these things being preserved was never on the cards. 

What difference does it make if I die in 50 years in comfort, or in 10 years along with the rest of my species, or tomorrow crossing the road? Why fear the inevitable? 

Perhaps we give humanity a little too much credit, expecting the imperfect to be capable of the sublime. A human species without greed, cruelty, ignorance, and violence would be blissful indeed, but would it still be the Human species? Of course these may all simply be symptoms of our modernization, but all I have is the experience my short time has given me, and a dream of utopia doesn't last long when presented with modern reality.    

I have a loving family around me, something I realize I am profoundly lucky to be able to say. A family that for almost three decades, I honestly didn't seem to notice. Taking it so much for granted that it had completely melted into the background of a anxious and self interested life. Now however, its like they are suddenly in HD. Soon they will be gone, and so now they burn bright.

Maybe its simply age that brings with it a certain appreciation and understanding, but acceptance of mortality and the finite nature of all things seems to have offered a helping hand. Stranger still, would I have found this kind of appreciation if it hadn't been for the coming collapse? would I have spent my life in blissful ignorance, wasting the days slaving away until suddenly, poof, gone. With perhaps only a brief moment to look back and go, fuck...    


For those that go without this luxury however, for those alone this Christmas, and any other of the 365 days we have decided don't mean quite as much for some ridiculous reason, consider this. 

Your knowledge makes you powerful, but to obsess over it, like anything done in excess, is harmful. You are, as of now, in a far better position than the majority around you. By understanding and accepting the coming reality you won't be as blindsided when it arrives. Perhaps you will even have gained skills to help out a little when the wave finally hits. But then maybe it will topple us all just the same and in which case, so what? If anything that seems fair. 

One of the most thought provoking things I have ever seen is a video of the 2004 boxing day tsunami. As the wave gets ever closer to the shore, there is a single man, laying on his surfboard, on the now deserted beach, waiting patiently. 

To my mind there where three possibilities as to why this man decided to remain.    

One: He was completely ignorant to what was about to happen, and so died as casual as he lived.      

Two: He truly believed that he could overcome the coming disaster and died fighting against the odds, his destiny his own.

Three: He had accepted his fate, and died laying on a beach he enjoyed, above his surfboard he held dear, free from denial.

\*it is of course possible his actions arose from shear panic but that rather spoils the analogy\*

I like to think It was the third option even though that is possibly the least likely, and would love to believe I could do the same, although only time will tell. But for now, the romanticism is a comfort. 

Another such comfort is the fate that will befall the 1%. Yes it is possible that some might have even some semblance of ease and normality in their fortified concrete mansions if they happen to get to them in time, but that's when it really gets good...

Imagine if you will dear reader, the grandeur, the marble tabletops, the oak paneling, the furs and paintings, the sofas and silverware, the luxury's beyond anything we could even conceive of. Now, think on how not a single one of those things matters in the slightest. Not just from a practical standpoint, but to the ignorant bastards themselves. So used to these luxuries that they no longer mean anything, so all that's changed is they have lost all freedom and hope. 

Locked inside their own golden tombs, slowly going insane from boredom and withdrawal, terrified that they might be discovered and ripped from their shell like an oyster, just a mouthful in the eyes of a predator. In fact its something I do dearly wish someone would make into a film. The blurb would go something like this: 

The family of a billionaire politician is forced into their luxury survival bunker when society collapses. At first they retain a certain amount of normality, but once the DVD selection has been watched and re-watched, the jigsaws completed and the drugs and alcohol consumed, they soon begin to loose their happy family demeanor, and their grip on reality itself. They slowly descend into madness, despair, incest, and eventually inhumanity, all without ever being able to accept the fact that they are primarily responsible for their predicament. 

It gives me a little shiver of excitement it really does, the sweet justice of it all. Tis a dream its true, and might not play out that way at all, but it's my dream, and provides no end of comfort. 

All these things combined, left to stew for a time, simmering with anger, distilling in despair, seasoned with bargaining, topped of with the last shreds of denial, *eventually* comes out as freshly baked acceptance, although you need to remake it every day to keep it fresh. Strange analogy I know but there's Christmas dinner being prepared in the background and it seems to be sinking in to my subconscious...         


After coming to hate Christmas over the last few years, I am fortunate enough to have found new meaning in it. Through my acceptance of our apocalyptic future, wonderful new appreciation of the present because of it, incredible fortune to be with a caring family and perhaps just getting bored with my inner Grinch.  

I may well be the first one to die as the wave of collapse reaches the shore, but so what? It was going to happen eventually, and actually, you have to admit that in a way, this is all very exiting isn't it? I mean if I had been given the choice of when to visit humanity, I would probably have chosen the most insane, hectic, Grimdark bit. So bring on the Collapse! I'm sitting on my surf board on this soon to be deserted beach, drink in hand, waiting patiently. Unless of course... it doesn't bloody happen fast enough >.<
