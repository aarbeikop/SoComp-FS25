"akdofk","collapse","skeptical","When shit hits the fan... and a British TV series called Utopia.","When it's much too late and the effects of climate change become an issue nobody can push to the back of their mind; when society is on the brink of dissolution humans will find a way just as they always have done before.

In adversity humanity has always found an answer to crisis. However, that answer in my opinion, will be a dark one.

There are two reasons we are in this mess. Overpopulation and human nature in the form of greed.

It is my belief that you can't change human nature. But you can change overpopulation. 

When the elite, major corporations, the leading world governments and their militaries watch as the world economy begins to tank and they can no longer keep the status quo and profit off the masses they will look to find a quick fix.

The fastest way to reduce emissions would be to drastically reduce the human population. This could be achieved by war, sterilisation or disease.

[An excellent UK TV series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(UK_TV_series) put forward the idea that the world elite would develop a virus that would sterilise the human population. Leaving a small proportion of the population either vaccinated or immune to the virus so they could reproduce. 

***The series is a dystopian thriller which addresses many issues of the Anthropocene, such as overpopulation and the running out of resources,[10] and combines it with contemporary anxieties about surveillance, epidemics and global conspiracies.***

Like the show, obviously in this scenario the world elite could manufacture a tale that such a virus was a natural but surprising phenomena, much like the unprecedented rise of AIDs in the 80's (although obviously AIDs was not manufactured). 

In my opinion if this solution was available I would be happy to reduce the world population to 1-2 billion in a way that allows the majority to live out their natural life.

This would radically reduce emissions and enable us to develop a life-sustaining eco-system for the new population. Our techniques at removing emissions from the atmosphere would yield a net positive and humanity would continue, albeit with a radically different mindset. 

I urge you all to watch Utopia. ","2019-01-27 16:47:10","29","21","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/akdofk/when_shit_hits_the_fan_and_a_british_tv_series/","True","EntireFeature","1747786580.903311","climate anxiety","manual"
