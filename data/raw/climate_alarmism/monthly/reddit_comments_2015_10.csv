2. Moving out of fossil fuels is indeed going to require fossil fuels.  Hence the need to get started early. But the fossil fuels required to produce solar and wind are much lower than say building a nuclear plant.

3. No. Basic finance. Why would you spend the upfront cost to cannibalize the exorbitant current profits from your existing operations? There's no business case to be made in a capitalistic model unless regulation or expected regulation will slash future profit. They have and will continue to fight it. The solar industry is extremely competitive... plenty of companies are taking advantage of the opportunity. ","2015-10-15 13:20:26","1","[deleted]","1747906850.905455","climate alarmism","manual"
"cw149hc","t3_3ouf0g","3ouf0g","environment","emotional","1. Yes, but we won't be able to scale up fast enough to address climate change in time. Given 100 years yes we could transition to solar and wind. But we only have 30-40 years to do it. Despite 20 years of massive growth and government subsidies, solar and wind today accounts for only a couple percentage points of total global electricity. Most renewable comes from hydro and that can't grow much more. Solar and wind will continue to grow, but unfortunately not fast enough. There are a number of reasons that make it so difficult: 1. New energy demand is growing rapidly so it needs to replace existing plus new. 2. The energy is diffuse, energy farming, requiring huge amounts of space which is disruptive and costly (new grids etc). 3. The energy is intermittent with the sun and wind.

2. Solar panels are mostly made in Asia which has a dirty grid mostly coal. Even so, an individual panel will offset over its lifetime more CO2 than it took to manufacture. However, the industry as a whole is growing rapidly and so every year more panels are being made than the last year. As a result, the panels already made are never able to offset the CO2 of the new panels being mfg -- they will eventually *if the industry stops growing* but that won't happen for a very long time. The solution is to buy solar panels from countries with clean(er) power such as USA and Europe. Or, slow down the mfg of panels so the existing ones are able to offset the new ones. Otherwise the solar industry has a net negative impact on global CO2 levels.","2015-10-15 21:21:41","1","FF00A7","1747906850.911493","climate alarmism","manual"
