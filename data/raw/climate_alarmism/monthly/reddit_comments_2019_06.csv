Then I realized, as fascists have realized, you don't need to have everybody think. People listen to stories with emotional content. Then they look around them to see what the majority is doing. Based on that ""social validation"", they declare their allegiance and act accordingly. Some alarmism is indeed appropriate, as another redditor commented. But the stories we tell in our social circles, and that get told through the arts, will set the tone. Some alarmism tempered with grief, and a rediscovery of the sacred (whatever that means to you) in the natural world, will motivate most people to stop acting as harmfully, and maybe even do something positive, like vote for the least idiotic candidate.","2019-06-05 19:42:23","11","metachron","1747950860.825643","climate alarmism","manual"

That's silly, of course there's a need to know what the mainstream narratives are.

 >How large is that third audience?

Small. Most people function off of emotion and tribalism. 

>Is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two?

No. The masses don't care to become analytical readers. They want to be spoon-fed an opinion so that they can get on with their day. The vast majority of people will never know or understand even the basic science behind climate change, expecting them to read articles that *depend* on at least that base of knowledge is silly. I can respect the scientific puritanism that you display but am consistently boggled that you seem to have a disconnect with how that same scientific puritanism *doesn't matter* for the vast majority of people on this planet. 

As with many of your posts, you equate Denialism to Alarmism as if they are on equal standings. Alarmism serves to push people towards *taking action on climate change*, while denialism is just regressive anti-intellectualism. Alarmism serves a climate-change-action-positive purpose, while denialism simply supports tribalism and us digging a deeper hole.","2019-06-05 19:02:09","10","TheNewN0rmal","1747950860.830133","climate alarmism","manual"
"eq5jtwg","t3_bx55oy","bx55oy","climatechange","action-oriented","> It's stupid to fault American journalism (or any journalism) for serving the first two audiences. That's the explicit task of much mainstream journalism: To serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach. Many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed (or challenged). These audiences will always exist. 

We are stupid for criticising inaccurate information?

So if American news media was massively exaggerating the threat of a country to the US when a war was building up, you would claim it is stupid to challenge that ""narrative"" and to present you side of the argument?

You are literally telling us to surrender our free speech and practice self censorship when confronted by a media saying things we disagree with. 

You have a conclusion in search of an argument without thinking through the argument you are trying to make.

The argument is about the media that is ignoring the issue all together. Seems most of the media does not fit into your supposed schema.

"eq06ghq","t3_bwnb7z","bwnb7z","collapse","skeptical","You seem to be very concerned about feminization of males.  A big part of that is what goes into our mouths:

-Namely dairy.  It carries a lot of estrogen.  Especially now that cows have been bred to give milk even while pregnant, and every gallon of milk in the store is the mixed product of a lot of cows.

-Fish.  Bioaccumulation up the food chain of substances.  Including mercury as well.

And for cardiovascular health, avoiding meat, dairy, eggs and excessive saturated fat in general.  Since the Korean War study, we knew atherosclerosis already affects young men and that was 70 years ago, now kids are eating shittier than ever before.  Part of the reason is we're of herbivore evolution with a minor in insectivory for the past 160 million years.  Up to recent, we didn't have to deal with a lot meat or animal products.

Your [cardiovascular system is your health](http://i.imgur.com/g1PKLfL.jpg).  Block parts of it and get a stroke in the brain, or alzheimers, or a heart attack, or even lower back pain.  When a man gets erectile dysfunction, we know it as a prelude to a heart attack in a decade's time.  That's because the penile artery is the size of a coffee stirrer while the heart artery is the size of a drinking straw.

Similarly, testicles get fed by blood and the waste products taken away by same.

Of smaller importance is to avoid Xenoestrogen, those estrogens mimicking compounds in plastics.  This might account for animals feminizing in rivers and oceans.  For humans, it probably comes from canned goods.  Specifically the lining in the cans is a thin spray on plastic, known as BPA.  This is known to leach, especifally in liquid.  BPA-free may not be much better, they're simply not studied enough.

As for pesticides and herbicides, buy organic or spray-on saltwater mixture, which seems to be a very effective way to get rid of it.
