He is a stout American Christian Conservative, who only gets his news from fox, hates the academia world (Harvard, Yale, Etc.), and really, truly believes in a Liberal Media conspiricy agenda. Despite all the science backing global warming, he still does not believe that it is real and that it is caused by humans.

I have given up trying to convince him of evolution because of his unwavering, literal translation of the Bible, but I know I can win the global warming argument based off of pure scientific consensus and data (97% of international climate scientists I believe). I can find very little information to back up his point of view but here is a long detailed email he sent me. He is an intelligent man who is willing to listen. I just want reddit to do what reddit does best and rip this to shreds please. I will go and do additional research but I thought I would come here first. Also, if you feel this post belongs somewhere else, or could be answered somewhere else please let me know.

Thanks Redditors!

""To continue our educational dialogue on global warming, see the following article below.  The models developed by climate scientists, which are the sole basis for the global warming alarms, are just not panning out.

As I mentioned yesterday, go to the web site ""Watts Up With That"".  The scientific consensus of ""human caused climate change"" that you quoted (97% of all climate scientists) has since been challenged by numerous sources.  Just in the U.S., over 31,000 scientists disagreed with the ""consensus"" (see the Oregon Petition) and a more recent survey showed that only 52% of climate scientists believe that global warming is mainly caused by humans.  Many prominent scientists who were previously believers in man-made global warming have changed their positions in just the last few years.  To me, that 52% number seems incredibly low when you consider the huge effect of governments and media preaching on global warming over the years.  Also, it's interesting to note in these polls that most climate scientists are on government payrolls which as you know fund a lot of the studies, models, etc. on global warming.  Might be a little bias/conflict of interest present in these polls.

While I'm not a climate scientist by any means, based on all that I've heard and read, I tend to believe that the current projections are highly inaccurate due to inadequacies of the modeling and that any observed global warming is more likely attributable to natural causes than to human activities.  But I promise to stay open minded on this topic and will continue to read/study articles, etc. on the issue of global warming.


EIGHTEEN YEARS, THREE MONTHS WITH NO GLOBAL WARMING
To the embarrassment of global warming alarmists everywhere, the Earth stubbornly refuses to get warmer. In 2009, Kevin Trenberth, one of the leading alarmist scientists, wrote in an email: “The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t.” Since then, things have only gotten worse for the warmists. The Earth has now gone for 18 years and three months with no warming. Christopher Monckton charts the satellite data:

Monckton adds this explanation:

The least-squares linear-regression trend on the RSS satellite monthly global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset shows no global warming for 18 years 3 months since October 1996.

The satellite data are by far the most reliable we have, since 1979 when they begin. Surface temperature data are badly compromised in several respects: 70% of the Earth is ocean; most weather stations are in cities that are artificially warmed, a fact that the keepers of the data steadfastly refuse to acknowledge; and–see the prior point–surface data are in the hands of the alarmist cabal, who consistently “adjust” the data to make the past look cooler and the present warmer, often without acknowledging that they have done so until they are caught.

The fact that the Earth hasn’t warmed for more than 18 years proves that the models, which are the sole support for global warming hysteria, are wrong. We are now well outside of any possible temperatures that the models forecast. Recognizing this fact, the IPCC significantly reduced its estimates of future warming in its most recent report, but the problem persists. Reality doesn’t conform to the new, more modest calculations, either:

Models that are invalidated by observation are worthless. There is no point trying to excuse their failure or make modest tweaks to keep the erroneous theories on which they are based alive. As a matter of science, anthropogenic global warming alarmism is finished. It survives, like a dead frog whose legs are still kicking, by virtue of countless billions of dollars in government funding. The warmists will keep up the charade as long as the money holds out.

Edit: Thanks Redditors for all your help! Here is my response back to my Dad. I will update again if he comes back with a response but I don't see how he can. Hopefully I didn't come across too strong or get too off topic at the end:

Dad-

The models developed by climate scientists are actually pretty accurate (http://skepticalscience.com/comparing-global-temperature-predictions.html). I don't agree with you that they aren't panning out. 

Just like in all matters of science (in fact its what makes science, science) there will be challenges made to all assertions. It is through this scientific process that we can comfortably come to a scientific consensus and conclusion. While I acknowledge that they are some dissenters, like the material on wattsupwiththat.com, I cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of the entire international scientific community has come to a consensus on this issue. Most of the skeptics questions and objections are based off of false premises and can be responded to through actual science, data, and facts (http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/may/06/top-ten-global-warming-skeptic-arguments-debunked).

So let's start with the author of the above piece who is explaining the science behind global warming-- Christopher Monkton. It is assumed with the authority that he is talking with that he is an expert on the issue and an experienced scientist in the field--not so fast. He actually isn't even a scientist. His background is in classic literature and journalism. He has never written any peer reviewed literature and is not considered to be stating correct theories but is apt at making references from slices of data that conform to his own opinion and interests. He claims that there is no evidence of temperatures rising in the past 18 years, yet when we look at the actual scientific peer reviewed data, such as the report published by the National Climate Center, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, who performed an analysis on three different data sets, all the data sets pointed towards a linear trend upward from 1998-2007 even with the warming being weaker in the British sets than the American sets. Data is dangerous in this manner, it can be sliced, cut, carved, and manipulated to say just about anything. We all know this from our experiences in business as well. This video goes through point by point on why Monckton is wrong: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbW-aHvjOgM . 

If you choose your start point and end point carefully enough, you can show any trend in data that you would like. Monckton chooses a very small period in time. Here is an expanded graph of global temperatures. The trend is fairly obvious.

I also urge you to think about it this way. Say that the ""warmists/alarmists"" are incorrect and in fact global warming is not a real thing but we take action anyway and try to invest more in renewable energy and cut back on emissions. Are we not in a better place than say if the ""warmists/alarmists"" were right and we took the action of the skeptics and didn't change a thing? If global warming isn't real, which course of action is a more dangerous?

You know that I am a strong believer in business and a small federal government, but this is a scenario where that principle has been turned into a dangerous,vitreous weapon. Conservatives (not really conserving in this example) are so entrenched with oil money in politics, that are willing to publish junk science and feed it through their media machine. I'm not claiming the liberals don't do the same thing on other issues through their own media machine. They are equally as guilty and probably more discrete (which some may argue is worse), but everyone should be aware and diligent of where certain messages are coming from. Follow the money--and there is a TON of it in oil. It is in many powerful, influential individuals interests to challenge a claim like global warming. Luckily, with a tool like the free-open internet, a small group of powerful, influential individuals can no longer manipulate the masses. The whole world can come together as a whole, collaborate, communicate, educate, and democratically elevate leaders, thinkers, changers, challengers, and most of all truth.","2015-01-13 13:02:41","7","6","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/2s9z7i/please_help_my_dad/","True","helpmydad41","1747747014.138773","climate alarmism","manual"

However, Gwynne Dyer's talk about climate change alarms me more than anything anyone else has ever said about the issue. Assuming what he says is true and we're operating on data nearly a decade old, I'm scared shitless that it may already be too late - that we've shot past 450 ppb in atmosphere CO2 and that the system may have already hit the point of no return.
