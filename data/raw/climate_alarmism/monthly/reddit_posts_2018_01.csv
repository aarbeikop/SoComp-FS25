"7qdd1x","climatechange","action-oriented","Need help with Wall Street Journal article","The weekend edition of The Wall Street Journal has an article by Benny Peiser and Matt Ridley called, ""Bad Weather Is No Reason For Climate Alarm."" (I would link it, the WSJ is behind a paywall.)

Anyway, most of the article seems to try to de-link weather (extreme events) from climate, which I generally suppose is a good idea.

But they do sneak in one or two things about climate change that caught my eye.

Mainly, they claim that temperature rise is not happening nearly as fast as the IPCC has predicted (nor is the rise accelerating).

They cite a 1990 IPCC assessment that predicts a rise of 0.3C every decade, and then claim temperatures have only risen between 0.121C and 0.198C per decade (depending on which data sets are used).

I am relatively new to trying to understand climate change, and cannot really figure out what data I should be looking at or where to find it.

Can anyone credibly confirm or rebut the article's claim?
