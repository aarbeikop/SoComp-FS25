Outside of that, investments into solar energy companies, EV companies, possibly buying the entirety, or at least a very large chunk of Amazon rainforest, investing in lab meat companies and such are some of the ideas. A private military force to safeguard animals target of trophy hunting is also a thing, but that is much more of an environmental cause instead of a climate change one.","2018-12-07 09:34:34","7","Webemperor","1747947680.692372","climate alarmism","manual"

"ebaw84e","t3_a3y3nh","a3y3nh","climate","scientific","Fund direct air carbon capture research. There are many scientists who just need guaranteed funding to do their work instead of chasing grants all the time. We need the brightest minds working 24/7 on engineering solutions instead of dealing with bullshit. Think Manhattan Project. The government is not capable of running it this time around it seems. Reducing emissions is very important too but realistically we're not going to alter human behavior or economic dependence on fossil fuels quickly enough. There is already a massive amount of excess carbon in the atmosphere compared to basically the entire span in which humans evolved (It hasn't really been higher than 300 ppm for the entire existence of homo sapiens until now). Beyond the obvious warming problem CO2 is acidifying the ocean and pretty soon it may start exerting health effects all on its own. (It may already be. Read up on possible metabolic effects of pollution and excess CO2 due to humans living mostly in enclosed spaces now. The obesity epidemic may be partly related, because even lab animals in fixed conditions have started getting fatter around the world.)  
We've got to pull the carbon out of the air and get back to baseline. Everything else is just mitigating the damage level. We literally could not plant enough trees to accomplish this any more even if we covered every square inch of land with them.  
  
On the more pessimistic side, they could fund open source habitat technology like hydroponics, air filtering, oxygen generation, etc. so that at least a reasonable number of people can survive when the world becomes basically uninhabitable outdoors.","2018-12-07 17:41:14","2","notabee","1747947680.71271","climate alarmism","manual"

"eaxn4ei","t3_a2ds9d","a2ds9d","climate","scientific",">The government report on climate change says that in the worst-case scenario, the US will lose more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century.

You are right. The economic models are ridiculous - but are totally different from the climate models, which appear to be reliable. 

It doesn't seem to make sense to try and produce a conventional economic model for a world rocked by sea level rise, famine, drought and war. I can't imagine how you would even begin.

I believe that was for 8C of warming, right? At 4C you see the end of civilization, and at 6C you have alligators splashing around in tropical rainforests around the poles. So the idea that there'd be even be an economy at 8C is absurd.

>Is this what climate change scientists want us to be so alarmed about?

Climate scientists are not economists and don't make these economic models.

There was actually some discussion of this release here by a physicist, also worth checking out the comments:

"eazelhx","t3_a2ds9d","a2ds9d","climate","scientific","As dire as it is, the National Climate Assessment understates the problem by miles because it limits findings to highly direct climate effects within U.S. borders. It ignores the fact that the rest of the world will experience deeper and more destabilizing impacts, in poorer places, which will have huge repercussions for the US and all developed countries. Think Syria, times twenty.

Last month's horrifying IPCC report is a better guide, and even that understates the problem. Remember that the IPCC has consistently understated climate damage for three decades in one Assessment Report after another. They don't take many feedbacks into account, and their reports have to pass muster with oil countries before publication.

The truth is that climate change is not only a big deal, it is close to becoming the only deal that matters.","2018-12-03 05:09:09","2","Splenda","1747947702.764321","climate alarmism","manual"
"eazwp5d","t3_a2ds9d","a2ds9d","climate","scientific","What I'm worried about and what most scientists are worried about is that from studying the earth past, we know that things have changed a lot and there were times when things were very cold (snowball earth) and times were it was very hot (hothouse). By studying the content of CO2 in the atmosphere we can deduce that those extreme changes were caused by comparatively small changes in the atmosphere. So why do small changes actually have big consequences? 

Well the reason is easy to understand it's called a feedback effect. When it starts to get cold on earth, there's more ice forming at the poles, therefore more radiation is being reflected to space, and the earth is cooling more and more over millenias, ending with a snowball earth. When there is a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere, it gets slightly hotter at first, but if there's enough heat it starts melting more ice, causing extra heat which causes more evaporation, causing more water vapor in the atmosphere, which melts even more ice, until the earth stabilizes in a 'hothouse' state where there's no ice and most of earth is in tropical climate.

There is no reason to believe that those events are somewhat unique to the past, and the physics behind those events are easy to understand. So if we put enough CO2 in the atmosphere, we will trigger a reaction that ends with a hothouse earth. It will happen more abruptly than in the past because the rate of emissions we are emitting is 10 times higher than natural causes in the past.

It is unlikely most ecosystems will be able to cope with those changes, triggering a mass extinction that might also make the earth lose it's ability to produce oxygen. Because of the rate of change. 

Finally, we are still talking about a couple of centuries to a millenia of abrupt climate change, so just looking at the end of the century will not give an accurate picture of the extent of things to come. On our deathbeds, we might all think 'climate change wasn't that bad after all' but a hundred generations down the line it is possible humanity will go extinct or live in a very hostile environment due to our carelessness.
