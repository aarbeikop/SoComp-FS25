"daytr6w","t3_5h9lqi","5h9lqi","climate","scientific","this is so false and it takes nothing more than a little logic.  disproving climate change - legitimately - would be the holy grail of climate research.  I know the literature well and have published a few climate papers, and I deeply respect some of the work people like Roger Peilke Sr have done.  Work that raises legitimate questions with the role land cover land use have played in the surface climate record, for instance.  Or even work by Watts (not a scientist) trying to blow holes in the USHCN record that eventually led to the Governmental Accountability Office auditing the USHCN/NCDC/NWS.  WHICH confirmed the TRENDS of the USHCN record - mind you.  But the truth is, the changes that are clearly in the US and world records - reflect that greenhouse gas impacts are indeed drastically changing the mean weather.  For example, the extreme daily minimum temperatures during the winter are disappearing.  For example, here is the annual count of nights with really cold temperatures (1963-2015) from the TOPOWX record (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/TopoWx) at the airport near my house (Grand Rapids, Michigan) http://imgur.com/a/b8s2i Sorry it's kinda hard to see.

"daz97i4","t3_5h9lqi","5h9lqi","climate","scientific","We have Conservapedia (""The Trustworthy Encyclopedia"") to save us from reality.

This is what Conservapedia says about climate change: ""Climate change is the new name used by liberals for their global warming hoax, which they coined as it became obvious that there is no crisis in global warming.""

In Conservapedia Einstein's theory of relativity has even been refuted, or to quote this seemingly endless fountain of information: 

""The theory of relativity is disproved by numerous counterexamples, but is promoted by liberals who like its encouragement of relativism and its tendency to pull people away from the Bible. Here is a list of 48 counterexamples: any one of them would show that the mathematical theory is incorrect …"".

According to counterexample 43, Genesis 1:6-8 indicates that Einstein was wrong.

"dayzhtb","t3_5h9lqi","5h9lqi","climate","scientific","There is no effective difference in the self righteous emisions of progressives who spend all their time blaming conservative deniers for their emissions.

What's the end game here ? Is it emissions reductions to stay under 2C ? We'll be there by 2050-2060 or so ([projecting the current trend forward](http://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/2c-201609.png)).  If that is the end game, just start reducing, it can be done, mine are down to about 2.5t CO2 per annum.  

It appears to me the end game is bickering for bickerings sake because no progressives are cutting their emissions by the amounts needed, quite the opposite, the leaders of the movement are some of the biggest emitters on the planet.  

Some folk unfortunately think this is a problem that can be addressed top down, that's not how societal change works.  Top down issues are like the Montreal Protocol on CFC's, where something can easily be substituted for another product and things can continue on as they are.  CO2 emissions reductions will never be top down driven, they must come from the bottom up, folk need to start reducing their emisisons and normalising low emsisions behavioir.  I do understand that won't happen which is why collapse is inevitable but I will call oit the bullsnit of asshole liberals who blame this on the asshole conservatives.  A pox on both your houses.  If you emit more than about 3-4t of CO2, you're the cunt causing this.","2016-12-09 04:20:39","-1","Capn_Underpants","1747926356.819456","climate alarmism","manual"
