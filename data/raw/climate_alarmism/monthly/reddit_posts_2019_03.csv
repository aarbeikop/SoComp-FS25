"ax99g6","collapse","skeptical","To be clear, David Wallace-Wells is not alarmist at all","Reading [this interview with Wallace-Wells](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/22/18188562/climate-change-david-wallace-wells-the-uninhabitable-earth) on Vox. I read his original article, haven't read the book yet, but seriously, his claims in this interview are FAR within the mainstream. Almost irrefutably true.

>So we are a little north of 1.1 degrees C of \[average\] warming above the preindustrial baseline, which is the historical temperature conditions that we measure global warming against.

Correct. We are at 1 degree right now.

>The UN says we’re on track to get to about 4 degrees or 4.3 degrees of warming by the end of the century if we continue as we are. I don’t think that we’ll get there, this century at least.

[Last November UN said we are on track for 3-5 degrees by 2100.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-un-idUSKCN1NY186)

>Well, on the path that we’re on now, there are some experts who believe we’ll get there \[to 2 degrees\] as soon as 2030. I think that’s probably a little fast, I think 2050 is probably a safer assumption. But again, as I said earlier, I don’t think it’s at all possible that we stay below 2 degrees without some dramatic transformation in the state of our technology with regard to negative emissions. So I think we’re basically certain to get there. 

[2 degrees by 2050](https://phys.org/news/2016-09-global-2c-threshold.html) is totally doable, and is not even surprising if we are on track for 3-5 by 2100.

The rest is simply the working out of this logic. A 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- degree world. The list of horrors simply goes on and on. Water. Food. Migration. Disease. Storms. Heat. Economy. Conflict. It takes no leaps of logic. If only half of it comes true, it's a nightmare.

If ""alarmist"" means something like being on ""the fringe,"" then Wallace-Wells is not fringe *at all.* He's basically just filling out the IPCC picture as it current stands.
