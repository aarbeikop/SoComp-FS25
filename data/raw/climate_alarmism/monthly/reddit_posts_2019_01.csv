THE term ‘Sustainable Construction’ emerges very often during usual Sustainability conversation but this key concept despite being the cornerstone for green infrastructure has not gained as much importance as it was anticipated. With fast growing urbanisation across India, the building activities have been witnessing rapid growth momentum, so does the strain on the finite natural resources.

It is true that expanding urban boundaries have also opened up better opportunities and promising future, thus further driving migration of rural communities to semi or urban cities, but at the same time the unplanned cities have been, it is a proven fact, increasingly triggering environmental degradation. The forest cover has been pruned or compromised while animals inhibited by toxic substances, vehicles and the loss of habitat and food sources…

Therefore, mounting voices all over the country have been demanding immediate corrective actions as well as implementation of more effective long-term policies in this transition to a low-carbon economy, strongly backed by the determined lawmakers as well as big corporations that wield immense money power and have their footprints in remote locations. The later can significantly influence communities around their operations. In addition, robust guidelines by the prominently recognised institutions like NITI Aayog in India as well as the United Nations and World Sustainable Development Associations in the global level will give impetus to undertake adequate remedial measures that safeguard Mother Earth from facing catastrophes like the one that caused destruction in Kerala – the biggest ever in the recent history of God’s own state.

To proactively preserve the environment from gradual degradation, a significant role is being played by the building material sector – along with other core industries – by doing whatever possible. However, this industry and its allied sectors like real estate have been criticised as among the greenhouse polluters. For instance, the country’s apex court Supreme Court has, in its recent interim order, has imposed a ban on construction activities in three biggest markets – Madhya Pradesh, Maharshtra and Uttarakhand – over the delayed framework by the state governments over solid waste management. While this has sparked much turbulence in the relevant sectors, fortunately it was lifted within days. Furthermore, recently the Delhi government too took cognisance of severe environmental impact on the national capital, partly blaming the construction activities.

The environment researchers reiterate the planet’s health will deteriorate even further unless a stronger platform for dialogue and collective action is not brought to the forefront to leverage existing capabilities, that too on a larger scope and scale. The efforts in this direction will accelerate low carbon transition at the time when the government is spending hugely in infrastructure projects – Housing for All, Smart Cities, Highways and Roads among others.

Therefore, much emphasis is given to the resilient green infrastructure that effectively addresses socioeconomic and environmental challenges by integrating holistic approaches leading to a conducive environment where economic indicators, social equity, consumption of energy and natural resources, and rapid advancements in technology thrive together. Emulating practices of global smart cities – Tokyo, Toronto, Seoul, Hong Kong, Amsterdam among others – is a good idea.

But over the years, the building material suppliers – particularly cement sector – have strictly adhered to and embodied the globally benchmarked Sustainable Practices that drove the Sustainable Construction, which has, as a result, been gaining momentum to promote and support green buildings that focused on mitigating both usage of natural resources as well as Green House Gases’ emissions. Their presence in rural and semi-urban regions owing to their nature of business has transformed the surroundings around its operations, generating livelihood and preserving the natural environment while balancing the sustained growth. In fact, India is among the countries that are on track to achieve the targets set to address climate change under the Paris Agreement.

The sector is adopting various practices to address alarming climate change issue – from innovative manufacturing processes that include optimising the extracted key ingredient limestone, advanced kiln mechanism, to energy utilisation and producing blended cement to offering value-added services including advanced concrete curing methodology and innovative rainwater harvesting solutions among others. Extending their efforts in this endeavours are the building architectures who are designing techniques including natural ventilation, double-paned windows, low-flow toilets and low-water-use landscaping etc – all enabling comfortable and improved inhabitants’ lives.

This gradual transition towards green and eco-friendly operations should be encouraged through a range of incentives, including tax breaks, or the prestigious certificates by the government. Involving a diverse set of stakeholders by the government to help improve sustainability scores while enhancing the value creation to the end users, besides enhancing awareness among all will surely deliver desired outcomes.

In conclusion, the low-carbon transition is a continuous journey. Mere implementation of the latest processes, technologies and government reforms may not completely minimise the scale and impact of climate change. However, things can be transformed gradually only by collective and sustained efforts towards climate-resilient emissions’ control strategies.
