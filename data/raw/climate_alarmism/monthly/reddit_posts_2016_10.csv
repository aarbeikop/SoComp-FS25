"58icbk","climate","scientific","""The hard truth is we can no longer live in this manner.""","A [recent article](https://www.reasonbowl.com/not-to-alarm-anyone-but-we-should-be-alarmed/) on the existential crisis of climate change states: 
>The hard truth is we can no longer live in this manner. We must accept that changes to our lifestyles will happen and work to make conditions livable in the process to becoming sustainable and scaling down industrial capitalism.

What that means exactly is a *drastic and radical reduction* in our current standard of living(accompanied by a huge drop in global population), something politically and socially untenable at this time.

The world is still heavily reliant on coal-fired power plants and will unfortunately remain so for decades to come. That's not an opinion or a wish, it's reality unless there are radical changes made in what constitutes today's ""civilization.""

A reddit commenter [summed up](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/58g04j/not_to_alarm_anyone_but_we_should_be_alarmed/d90a9wv) modern man's predicament perfectly:

>>There’s talk of a World War II mobilization effort needed to combat climate change

>This may well be necessary, but it also won't happen. Because the thing about wars is that you're defending your people and the things you love against an enemy. With climate change, the things we love are the enemy.

>Cheap flights, modern technology, plastic crap. These are the freedoms that Bush 2 sent America to war to supposedly defend. So what do you think will happen to people who want to prevent global warming by taking the necessary steps? They won't be seen as heroes, but as the enemy.

>Everyone is hoping that modest and gradual scientific advances will be enough to reduce co2 levels rapidly, because it will be impossible to convince people that they should give up their comfort to combat global warming. Because then we would have to accept that the enemy is ourselves.

>And I just don't see that happening before it's too late.


What did Germany turn to when it shut down its nuclear power plants?...

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601514/germany-runs-up-against-the-limits-of-renewables/

And the popular claim that Costa Rica runs on nothing but ""renewables"" for long lengths of time is a [false claim](http://thecostaricanews.com/energy/did-costa-rica-really-use-99-renewable-energy-in-2015/). Two thirds of their total energy usage is still hydrocarbons. Electricity generation only accounts for 18% of their energy consumption which is what those sustainability claims are referring to.

Without going into a detailed discussion on the limitations of ""renewable energy"" technology(such as [here](http://simplicityinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CanRenewableEnergySustainConsumerSocietiesTrainer.pdf), [here](https://citizenactionmonitor.wordpress.com/2015/12/27/renewable-energy-hope-or-hype/), and [here](http://www.resilience.org/stories/2016-06-22/renewable-electricity-falling-costs-variability-and-scaling-challenges)), the reality is that the world is heavily reliant on coal:

[Hundreds of coal plants are still being planned worldwide — enough to cook the planet](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11361390/coal-plant-pipeline-china-india)

[Climate change or not, power-starved India just can’t help burning more coal](http://qz.com/707432/climate-change-or-not-power-starved-india-just-cant-help-burning-more-coal/)

Negative emission technology is simply more vaporware that enables people to believe business-as-usual can persist into the future depsite dire consequences:

[“Negative-emission technologies are not an insurance policy, but rather an unjust and high-stakes gamble.”](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/scientists-warn-negative-emissions-moral-hazard-20785)

[The trouble with negative emissions](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6309/182.full):

>It is not well understood by policy-makers, or indeed many academics, that IAMs assume such a massive deployment of negative-emission technologies. Yet when it comes to the more stringent Paris obligations, studies suggest that it is impossible to reach 1.5°C with a 50% chance without significant negative emissions (3). Even for 2°C, very few scenarios have explored mitigation without negative emissions (2). Negative emissions are also prevalent in scenarios for higher stabilization targets (7). Given such a pervasive and pivotal role of negative emissions in mitigation scenarios, their almost complete absence from climate policy discussions is disturbing and needs to be addressed urgently.

"55wu3f","collapse","skeptical","Fair reminder: We won't rebuild civilization","-How was the first oil extracted? You stuck a spade in the ground and it spew out. That oil is now gone. How is today's remaining oil extracted? You dig holes into the ground, inject steam, carbon dioxide or other gasses to mobile the oil, then use expensive refineries to convert the product into something that resembles oil as we used to know it.

-How complex is the technology needed to extract a 90% pure copper ore? Not very complex. How complex is the technology needed to extract 0.45% pure copper? A lot more complex. Giant machinery is needed to create the kind of large scale project that's efficient and financially viable. But how do you extract the copper, if you need to start over again, without all of the giant machinery?

-What did medieval people use to build houses, churches, ships and melt metals? Wood. What happened to those forests? We chopped them down, progressively depleting them until we became dependent upon coal for activities that formally used wood.

-How did pre-industrial people have thriving farms with fertile crops, in widely differing environments, able to tolerate wildly differing conditions and resistant to a variety of plagues? Biodiversity, produced by generations of selective breeding. What happened to these rare breeds? They lost them during the transition to industrial agriculture. Relying on biodiversity to prohibit the spread of disease was replaced with relying on pesticides.

-About a quarter of Southern African adults have HIV/AIDS. The disease is kept under control and kept from spreading through advanced modern medicine. Adults with the virus can now be found in every country around the world. What happens to that virus when we can't afford the anti-retroviral drugs anymore?

-Is it still cost-effective to build steel reinforced concrete infrastructure in the future, [when the life expectancy of this infrastructure is reduced by anywhere up to 31% due to higher co2 concentrations in the atmosphere?](http://www.dovetailinc.org/report_pdfs/2016/dovetailconcrete0816.pdf)

-Half the world's population lives within 60 km of the sea, and three-quarters of all large cities are located on the coast. If the sea level continues to rise for the next 500 years, as is generally expected, how will we construct the type of cities we know today? Rome wasn't built in one day, by the time you'd be halfway through, the city would be underwater. Perhaps more importantly, how do you build big cities near coasts, [when sea level rise causes tsunamis due to the higher pressure creating underwater landslides](http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/yes-climate-change-may-cause-more-tsunamis-no-thats-not-alarmism.html)?

-How will you keep all those nice inventions of yours from falling into the wrong hands, of people who could use them to create profound damage? What happens to biological and chemical weapons? What happens to our nuclear weapons, located in such stable countries like Pakistan, North Korea, Israel and soon to be Iran? What happens to all the nuclear waste stored everywhere? Any city or country that seeks to maintain stability will find itself harmed by instability elsewhere.

When it falls apart, we won't be able to rebuild it.","2016-10-05 00:42:36","15","23","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/55wu3f/fair_reminder_we_wont_rebuild_civilization/","True","-triggerexpert-","1747925206.9970639","climate alarmism","manual"
