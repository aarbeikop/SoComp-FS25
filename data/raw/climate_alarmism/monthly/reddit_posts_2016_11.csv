"5c9468","climate","scientific","Solutions for the Common Citizen?","In the wake up Donald Trump's election I've mostly been interested in how this will affect climate change and climate research. What I have found is incredibly disheartening. However, I've seen that I am not alone. Many people are voicing outrage and alarm over what Trump and his policies could mean for climate change in the future. 
This country was built on protest and ordinary citizens speaking their mind- I think that this is a time when such action will likely be necessary. I've been thinking about what a massive protest in Washington DC could do to make more people realize what a huge issue this is and that there are many people willing to stand up for what is right and not destroy our planet. Pulling out of the Paris Accords, repealing the Clean Air Act, and other actions that hinder a cleaner planet for future generations deserve public protest and outcry.
I figured I would post this here first, but I would like any help I can get in suggestions of other people and organizations to contact. When actions that hurt our environment and planet are bound to happen we should be prepared to mobilize and act, I'm tired of being a complacent bystander in the destruction of this beautiful country and planet and I hope there are others who feel the same way and can help myself and others in coming together to stop these crimes against nature from continuing to proliferate.
