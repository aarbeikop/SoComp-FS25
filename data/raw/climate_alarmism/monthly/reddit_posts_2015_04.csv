"34e6xg","climatechange","action-oriented","How viable is the notion that climate change is not human related?","My understanding of climate change is that the Earth is continuing to move vertically while keeping the same orbit. Therefore the climates of the earth are undergoing change because the angle in which light enters our atmosphere has changed as it always has over the course of the earth’s history. As well as emissions from volcanoes and other natural gas sources have always affected the atmosphere creating holes and contributing to the greenhouse effect. Now I know just over the past century the earth’s temperature has risen 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit but how much of that is human related and is that 1.4 degree increase of any significance? If we look back over the past 2 million years the earth's changing carbon dioxide levels and concentrations have been increasing and this recent increase in temperature over the past few decades is not alarming in the slightest for its natural across the earth’s history.


How viable is my way of thinking? Most people are very quick to shut me down and instantly discredit all of the research I have done. Is there anyone else with the same or similar viewpoint? What are your opinions on the subject?
