"52jveh","climate","scientific","Sorting through denial, fact and alarmism","I wanted to get people's opinions and methods for deciphering the mountains of articles and papers on climate change. I understand that climate change isn't an exact science in terms of it relies on predicting future events with an unthinkable amount of variables (even as a biochemist the amount of variables makes my head hurt). But how do you look at this large spread of often contradicting data and decide what's denial, what's fact and what's alarmism?
