Having read Deep Adaptation, and been involved with Extinction Rebellion (Berlin) throughout summer, this is a very interesting paper. Covers a bit more of the Bendell-ism, and how trustworthy the paper is. 

Works then from the ""inevitable near-term collapse"" premise to try to say if it is a credible worry.

&#x200B;

My two cents. 

I think Bendell, Rupert Read and Roger Hallam have lost track of scientific rigour, and lean hevaily on emotional blackmail with pseudoscience in their talks.

That said, I also agree that scientists hide in their tiny field of study, and are willfully unable to link together bigger pictures. Adding the geopolitics, how history itself has palyed out, and the cancerous weakness in all modern rich societies at present... there is absolutely cause for concern.

I have nothing to lose by stating that on a scientific platform, but risk my career (if I stay in science) by doing so. It is hardly surprising that few established scientists are willing to state in the open that they are concerned.

  
I think this section is of importance though, and can both support or refute climate change as a driver of social breakdown.

*""As shown  by American physicist Dr. Yaneer Ban Yam and his team at the New England  Complex Systems Institute, in the years preceding 2011, global food  price spikes linked to climate breakdown played a role in triggering the  ‘Arab Spring’ uprisings. And according to hydroclimatologist Dr. Peter  Gleick,* ***climate-induced drought*** *amplified the impact of socio-political  and economic mismanagement, inflicting agricultural failures in Syria.  These drove mass migrations within the country, in turn laying the  groundwork for sectarian tensions that spilled over into a protracted  conflict.* 

*In my own work, I found that the Syrian conflict was not just  triggered by climate change, but a range of intersecting factors—Syria’s  domestic crude oil production had peaked in the mid-90s, leading state  revenues to hemorrhage as oil production and exports declined.* ***When  global climate chaos triggered food price spikes****, the state had begun  slashing domestic fuel and food subsidies, already reeling from the  impact of economic mismanagement and corruption resulting in massive  debt levels.* ***And so, a large young population overwhelmed with  unemployment and emboldened by decades of political repression took to  the streets when they could not afford basic bread.*** *Syria has since  collapsed into ceaseless civil war.""*

Seeing the speed Hong Kong has lost all rights in the face of such fascistic force is incredible. They have no problems with food supply, and the enemy is a tolalitarian regime... but what do they have in common with us?

Their young people have no hope for the future. We are at peak comfort now. Peak relationship satisfaction has been and gone. The genders are at war, globally. Climate change is clearly advancing in spite of the ""beatiful words"" of politicians (most noteworth the Rio Accord in 1992, well ignored in spite of the Precautionary Principle within it). 

Food security is **already** precarious, even without climate change, or the need to change our production systems to reduce emissions. Just population growth and rising wealth alone will strain it near to breaking, and push prices up (from their current historic lows). 

It therefore seems **obvious** that places with low social capital will face social collapse soon.","2019-11-24 12:20:41","62","11","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/e0xv2q/vice_article_on_how_imminent_collapse_is_and_if/","True","Sun_Wukong_72","1747954021.184376","climate alarmism","manual"
