And that we are actually heading towards an Ice Age.","2015-05-05 20:51:56","3","soco79","1747898276.89319","climate alarmism","manual"

There's a classical view of climate change that is very different from what we're being told today. The classical view, in a nutshell, is this: Given the current geography of Earth and stage of the Milankovitch cycle we expect that the planet has settled around a climate mean that varies naturally due to competing feedback mechanisms. For instance, warmth increases evaporation over time leading to an increase in cloud cover that leads eventually to natural cooling. Milankovitch cycles play a role in overturning the current climate regime on the order of thousands of years. Within those cycles climate varies around a mean on the order of hundreds of years. Within those hundreds year periods are the short term modifiers such as ENSO. Climate may only effect the thin skin and atmosphere of Earth, but that is still a very large area that takes time to warm and time to cool. Feedback mechanisms can't shift temperature trends quickly.

Within the last 1000 years Earth has swung from (what some would call) the extreme heat of the Medieval Warming Period (MWP) to the extreme cold of the Little Ice-Age (LIA) and back to the current warming period. So, despite any supposed human contribution Earth would be warming anyway as the cycles progress. 

Keep in mind that Earth is a water planet and it's all that water that is the major contributor to climate variation. It's accepted that water in the atmosphere is responsible for a 30C difference in the global temperature that we would expect given out planet's distance from the sun. By far, water is the most important of ""greenhouse"" gases. An increase in global humidity has accompanied the current warming. This has been attributed by AGW proponants to be due to CO2 ""forcing"", meaning that the increase in CO2 has caused sufficient warming to drive higher evaporation rates. But there's no evidence that's the case.  

As much as they like to protest the point, AGW has a very weak case. Right now human CO2 output contributes about 2% above the natural output (6gt vs 300gt) and is falling behind further as warming causes the release of yet more sequestered CO2 from soils and the ocean. Considering that the current warming has not yet come close to that of the MWP we can expect a huge increase in CO2 levels from those natural sequestered sources. The high CO2 level of the MWP did nothing to prevent the onset of the LIA so there is really no reason to think that the paltry human ccontribution wil have any effect either.

But the majority of peer-reviewed papers from that period (that made any prediction) predicted warming.

Whatever happened to 'global cooling'? It failed to fit the evidence.","2015-05-24 11:34:23","4","strum","1747898527.2714822","climate alarmism","manual"

We can expect another ice age to begin in about 22,000 years because of the wobble in the Earth's axis.  The more immediate concern is the warming of the atmosphere and oceans due to the greenhouse gasses released when we burn fossil fuels. This is the problem we're facing now.","2015-05-24 07:33:32","4","Ian_Rubbish","1747898527.274227","climate alarmism","manual"
