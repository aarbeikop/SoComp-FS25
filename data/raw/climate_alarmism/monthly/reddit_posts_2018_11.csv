"9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","What They Never Explained...","What people who insist that climate change is threatening enough to warrant aggressive policy changes have never sufficiently explained, is why it would be plausible that a belief that happens to precisely fit their emotional needs also happens to be true. Climate change alarmism looks and feels exactly like half a dozen former environmental scares, that all turned out to be wrong. So we can conclude, that many people have an emotional need to believe in such scares, and that such beliefs are exceptionally plausible to them. If we find a belief that many people strongly crave, the most likely explanation is that they believe it because they like the belief, not because it is true. That reality should oblige the emotional needs of the early 21st century green person is highly unlikely. It rather seems that global warming is a psychologism. A certain portion of the population simply wakes up with a sensation that doom is imminent, and then they come up with reasons for why this feeling is justified. The one common thread of the green era was that the world was always supposed to be ending, it was always urgent and hysterical, they just now and then changed the reason of why exactly it is ending. All these environmental scares are structurally replaceable, and seem to run the same emotional habit. The plausible explanation of these observations is not that greens must be right about the last reason they propose, but that they have some internal reason for believing in immanent doom, and then find rationalizations for it. Even traditional religion is functionally the same belief system and has been found to run on the same cognitive hardware as environmental beliefs. Warmists certainly behave like religionists, it is very important to them that everyone accepts their belief. Climate change has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations, always changing the story under the same label as old theories get refuted. The ""consensus"" thus does not confirm catastrophic global warming, but can refer to acceptance of any of the many theories with that name. Yet is always taken to confirm the current iteration of catastrophic global warming.

Edit: I'm throwing this out as a challenge. If you want to convert me, then explain it to me. I have heard plenty of the usual hostile talking points, and that's not what I'm looking for. Don't just request me to justify my claims, or nitpick at my arguments, and claim that me not making good enough arguments somehow makes your belief true. This is an opportunity to the believer, to explain to me, the disbeliever, why your belief is plausible.","2018-11-05 12:39:04","0","21","0.22","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9ud5pr/what_they_never_explained/","True","taylor-4","1747947122.917751","climate alarmism","manual"
