"f4kk2jd","t3_dk8nad","dk8nad","climatechange","action-oriented","The climate models are based on historical data. Directly recorded from instruments and indirectly from other indicators. Have you heard of paleoclimatology?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology)

Hopefully the climate models don't rely on random weather anecdotes like the ones in your text.

The data (both historical and from paleoclimatology) has been combined to describe how the global (well, mostly northern hemisphere) climate has changed over thousands of years. This data has even been plotted. And the resulting graph became tremendously famous: The Hockey Stick graph!

The Hockey Stick graph has been widely disputed and questioned. Not surprising since it provides a stark demonstration that the current global heating is unprecedented in the historical record.

This is great. Because the Hockey Stick graph was so questioned and disputed it has been tested, refined and recreated and validated again and again. By various teams using various methodology. And every serious (=based on climate data) attempt to show that the Hockey Stick graph is wrong or bad has failed.

So because the questioning the message that the Hockey stick graph sends has been strengthened. And ever harder to continue to question.

Still climate deniers try to spread the message that the Hockey stick graph has been refuted. But fail to demonstrate that. They just say it. It hasn't been refuted. It has improved and perhaps it looks a little less than a smooth hockey stick now, but it is even more terrifying, just because of that.

The pesticides associated with bees dying off are 'Organophosphates' which are unrelated to GM crops.  I suspect you are confusing this pesticide with glyphosate, which works with a completely different mechanism.

The goats eating GM corn-stalks and dying doesn't make sense either.  The gene change in GM corn targets enzymes that don't exist in mammals.  There isn't a mechanism for GM corn to harm the goats unless there is something else they ate.  These stories tend to be light on facts and heavy on conspiracy theories.

The rest is conspiracy theories, so I don't have anything to add there.

When it comes to AG issues it ultimately comes down to population.

If you want to farm like it is pre-1920s, then we need to have a MUCH smaller world population.  This is because of the inefficiencies inherent in ""organic"" farming.

If you are not interested global genocide, then GM crops + organic methods is the way of the future.  We need to produce more on less land and less viable land.","2019-10-16 13:35:18","3","adamwho","1747953412.1486201","climate alarmism","manual"

No, they didn't. Stop spreading this lie.

If you can actually connect Monsanto pesticides to the die off, feel free. But you can't, because you don't actually know what's going on. 

>Ask yourself, have you ever heard of bee die offs and Monsanto in the same sentence, you can thank Google and MSM for that.

Or, you know, facts. CCD is connected to certain neonicotinoids. Monsanto didn't produce the neonics that are linked to CCD.
