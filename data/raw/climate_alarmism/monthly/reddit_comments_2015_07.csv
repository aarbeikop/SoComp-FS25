----------

I could go into a tirade of trying to ""prove you wrong!"" so on etc, being a skeptic who accepts elements of AGW and rejects elements of CAGW.      
But that would be off topic, disrespectful and more importantly, that's not going to convince you of anything.     

Likewise, if you're already of the attitude of ""Without wanting to punch them in the face"" then you are approaching it with the wrong attitude. Calm down, reason that everyone has their own perceptions on the subject that you won't be able to *force* them to change.   
The more you pressure them, the more you drive them into defending their opinion.   

So calm down. Relax, don't think of them as ""Deniers"" because you're already building up a straw man of prejudiced conceptions about them. Just discuss it with them, see what they think, and correct them where you feel you can. ","2015-07-15 02:23:13","4","kriegson","1747902999.753545","climate alarmism","manual"

"ct4cql8","t3_3dbxy2","3dbxy2","climatechange","action-oriented","Talk about impacts that affect them. It's pretty characteristic of humans to care more about themselves than 'others' whether they be of a different species or just different people around the world - it's pretty easy to not care about polar bears or South Pacific Islands under threat from sea level rise when they won't be directly affected by that. 

Learn some of the regional impacts of climate change, whether it be habitat migration, losing their favorite coldwater fishing spot, increased drought and wilfires, flooding and storms. When people realize they're feeling the impacts of a changing climate, that's when they'll be swayed by scientific evidence. 

Yale has a project on climate communication that's spot on.

"ct3qy89","t3_3dbxy2","3dbxy2","climatechange","action-oriented","> So how does one talk to people that say that the climate is changing at an alarming rate without wanting to punch them in the face?

Emotion is a trait of irrationality and religion, not science.

Very few actually deny climate change, they deny the Malthusian claims.  If you believe in science, you need to re-evaluate why you are emotional over what other people think.

PS, no part of the climate is changing at an alarming rate, and nothing close to record rates.  From Co2, to temps, to weather extremes, to drought/flooding, to SLR, to anything.  The proxy reconstructions show the world had FAR more volatile changes before mankind, in every regard. There have been periods where the seas rose full meters in a year, temps fluctuating 2C in a decade, Co2 rising(at 2XXX ppm) faster then today, and the list goes on, most within the last 20k years.

About the only thing that is unique in the geologically recent past is the record low Co2 levels.

For most of the last million years, Co2 was at a critically low level with regards to photosynthesis which has lead to some severe choke points for life on earth.

>[CO2] has varied throughout geologic time, and during some periods may have been so low as to greatly limit plant growth and reproduction (Ward, 2005).

>**The LGM that occurred 18 000–20 000 yr ago represents a fascinating time when low [CO2] likely constrained the physiological functioning of C 3 plants** (Polley et al. , 1993a; Dippery et al. , 1995; Sage & Coleman, 2001; Ward et al. , 2005; Lewis et al. , 2010). During that period, [CO2] dropped to 180–190 ppm (Petit et al. , 1999; EPICA, 2004), **which is among the lowest concentrations predicted to have occurred during the evolution of land plants** (Berner, 2003, 2006; Tripati et al. , 2009).
