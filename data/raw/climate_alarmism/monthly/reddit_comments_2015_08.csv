The problem with global warming is that it's caused by Capitalism. Capitalism is so entrenched into the global structure of power it seems almost impossible to change at this point. Can we really get 7 billion people to change how we produce and consume? Can we expect activism to champion the changes that are necessary to combat a problem on the global scale? I don't think so.

So the answer to your question (really) is twofold: 
1. Getting people to present a cohesive front is quite difficult. There's a reason that, even within the divisions of the major political parties, you get two candidates like Clinton and Sanders that could very well be different parties. 
2. People are already trying. But that kind of unity is only helpful when it also had direction and interdisciplinary support. 

For instance, after the publication of the most recent IPCC and NCA, everyone I know that was a contributing author/lead scientist was gathered to create a list of take-aways and essential points. They were then schooled on how to present these points and sent out to various radio stations, local news channels, etc. to spread the same message. This was of course very useful in terms of presenting a united front, but it made only a small impact given that they were essentially preaching to the choir or talking to the deaf, depending on which side their audience already affiliated themselves with.

There is still no clear idea of what is the solution to the climate crisis.  Asking people, or even countries, to cut back on fossil fuel usage is a weak answer.  Because other people (or countries) will continue to burn fossil fuels.  All that conservation does is to make fossil fuel a bit cheaper for someone else.  See [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox).

How about **restricting the supply** instead?  Seek rigorous government action to restrict the amounts of fossil fuel extraction, reducing it each year.  Then let people and markets freely make creative decisions about how to adapt.

Anything that is extracted is burned.  The theory behind emission reductions is that reducing demand will result in less fossil fuel extraction.

The Endocene

"" This brings us to the absurdly ignorant, painfully ironic campaign to save nature AND humanity, concocted by the group known as Conservation International which debuted at the beginning of the week.  M. Sanjayan, an executive vice president and senior scientist at CI, describes the project as an attempt to ""rebrand"" environmentalism to be less about preserving wildlife and more about preserving humans, by emphasizing that people are dependent upon nature.  Like the World Wildlife Fund, also founded by royalty and other elites, the leadership is so steeped in privilege that they have no clue at all what a bitter taste emanates from their efforts.""

According to Wise's calculations linked to above, if we want to stop climate change, but also want 9 billion people by 2050 to have the standard of living the EU has in 2007, CO2 per dollar of GDP will have to decline from 768 in 2007, to just 14 grams per dollar by 2050.

That looks really difficult to me on first sight, so I have the following questions:

Is it really possible to reconcile the desire for economic growth with the desire to address climate change?

Should we look at a steady-state economy, that no longer grows, as a solution to climate change?

As both a moderator here and somebody who frequently spends (perhaps ""wastes"") a lot of timing debating with climate change deniers online, it's clear to see that many of the online commenters are just the tip of a mass media effort to redefine climate change as a political argument in order to detract from the science and make the implications of climate change something to dismiss as socialist/liberal alarmism. Many popular mass media publications regularly ridicule the scientists and science of climate change, and anyone that accepts the science in general, all the while driving home the point that it's a political issue, not a scientific or even societal one. Then reaching further up the ladder, we see entire political parties express almost venomous hate toward anything climate science, while even the governments that claim to believe the science are still mostly allowing and often encouraging fossil fuel explorations.

The plan to *prevent* meaningful action on climate change does appear to have been an enormous success.

So, my main question is, what will it take to change this?

Protesting and writing letters to our representatives doesn't appear to have done enough so far. Often it seems that people are even more politically entrenched in their opposition to climate change actions nowadays than a decade ago. Almost every national and international scientific institution has declared that climate change is real and caused by human activities, thousands of scientific reports and papers are published every year, evidence is constantly accumulating to show that we are the cause and things are already becoming unstable, yet here we still are, applying all this work and effort only for our wheels to continue spinning in the mud.

I've seen many mainstream news articles about the latest dire climate science that report the findings accurately, and then conclude by suggesting (often by citing a quote from you) that a carbon price will be enough to prevent the worst.

A carbon fee-and-dividend, as Citizens' Climate Lobby proposes, seems like a great first step, but it seems clear that much more is needed, very soon, to draw down emissions as rapidly as necessary to prevent a rise of 2C or more (and even more to avoid 1.5C, as you advocate).

Other climate scientists like Michael Mann have advocated for an [economic mobilization on the scale of the American World War II mobilization](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org) to eliminate and withdraw excess greenhouse gas emissions, and a growing number of people, including CCL founder Marshall Saunders, are [signing a pledge](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/notable_pledge_signers) to endorse this platform and build toward the massive political will necessary to achieve it in the U.S.

His argument is compelling to me: essentially that impacts will be (and have already been) lower than the worst scenarios, and that the cost of reducing CO2 emissions would be very high, and that is money that would be better spent on poverty, education, and health improvements for the 6 billion impoverished people on the planet.

Also - and worse, I find the cultural brigading of diverse opinions on climate change a scary thing. Science should be an open dialogue where multiple opinions are not just considered but encouraged. My impression of the climate change debate is that this is far from reality.","2015-08-12 15:34:08","6","theycallhimhellcat","1747904490.7304718","climate alarmism","manual"

I've been feeling conflicted lately, so I just have a quick question. It's true we need to start taking action, and with all of this attention drawn to needing an **urgent** reduction in GHG, I find it frustrating that some drivers get ignored. I recently came upon a number of studies that put animal agriculture as a very major driver of climate change,^[1](http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm),[2](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)  and that they will only get worse^[3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v515/n7528/full/nature13959.html). How can we tackle the contributions to carbon dioxide emissions due to animal agriculture, and should this be something we deal with as a nation? Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.^[4](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294) As a very politicized topic, is it ever possible for our government to endorse a slow reduction of consumption of animal products, or a similar initiative? How can we ardently push for reduction in transportation and reorganization of our energy sources (which I completely agree with) but willingly ignore this very integral part of climate change?

"cu0cmvd","t3_3gporh","3gporh","science","scientific","A multi-meter rise in ocean levels seems beyond the usual claims, so to what extent would a multi-meter rise in ocean levels mitigate ocean acidification?

It's scientifically clear that anthropogenic warming is happening, but it seems less clear to me that the consequences will be a global cataclysm for humans. By which I mean, possibly many areas will experience increased drought, possibly many areas will experience increased storm frequency and intensity, possibly many species in the oceans would die from increased acidification, and consequently we would probably see drastically reduced biodiversity.

However, none of the above necessarily entails that *many human lives would be lost* due to climate change, which is what most people care about. Drought is handled by transportation or relocation, storms are handled by construction or relocation, and loss of biodiversity is handled by our reliance on agriculture. So even if climate engineering were to fail, our other means of mitigating the problems aren't necessarily inapplicable simply because the climate changes. Would you agree with this assessment? I think this belief that humans aren't really at risk may hold many people back from endorsing swift and immediate change.

I endorse change simply because tens of thousands of people per year *already die* from air pollution in the US alone, which is a *real and quantifiable cost* we're paying right now. The costs of anthropogenic warming seem less clear by comparison, and if you can't quantify it in real terms as being *even more costly* than the tens of thousands of lives per year we're clearly already willing to sacrifice, then convincing such people would be difficult indeed.","2015-08-12 13:52:01","5","naasking","1747904490.738048","climate alarmism","manual"

I am kind of at my wits' end with my father and his attitude toward global warming.  He believes that carbon emissions are damaging and that global warming is happening, but that it isn't as bad as people say it is.  He says that we have recently come out of an ice age, therefore it is somewhat expected that the earth is going to warm up a bit.  We may be damaging the environment, but a lot of the symptoms of carbon emissions can be attributed to natural causes.

Is there any article that you know of that I can use as a counter-argument?  His argument is so specific that I find it difficult to quickly and easily trump it.  I am not trying to get in a fight with him, I just want him to stop trying to convince people that global warming isn't an issue.","2015-08-12 14:06:38","4","dannimatrix","1747904490.7412522","climate alarmism","manual"

For me such a scenario would involve unrecoverable collapse leading to extinction. In this scenario humans aren't able to generate the collective intelligence needed to mitigate the major issues facing us. This leads to a state where technology can never develop to the point to mitigate extinction-level risks such as asteroid strikes or  nasty pandemics hitting the remaining population.

I cope with this by understanding that while we not be able to survive in the long-term, evolution is embodied in the Universe. The Universe *is* evolution in a sense, and this means that somewhere a species might have the collective intelligence to make it to the stars. In other words, we might be failures as a species, but that doesn't mean the Universe is a failure. Realizing this makes me feel better.","2015-08-12 14:50:28","4","Pfeffa","1747904490.743386","climate alarmism","manual"
