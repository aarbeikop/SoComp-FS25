- using false experts

- logical inconsistencies

- having impossible expectations on science

- cherry-picking data

- resorting to conspiracy theories

These are covered in more detail in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXA777yUndQ), which is part of the Denial101x MOOC course, from the University of Queensland - https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x-1 


The IPCC AR5  report presents the broadly supported, mainstream evidence on climate change. The report was created in 2013, so it's now a number of years out of date https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf

I would place Guy McPherson in the category of alarmist, since he takes the worst-case scenario of all positive feedback mechanisms. What he describes is possible, but highly improbable. That being said, we are almost guaranteed to see significant social and economic disruption and political destabilisation, since our carbon budget is [rapidly running out](http://i.imgur.com/XLaMu0u.gif), and the Syrian refugee crisis a hint of what's to come","2016-09-13 11:35:34","2","fungussa","1747923674.500063","climate alarmism","manual"
"d7lut3k","t3_52jveh","52jveh","climate","scientific","The first thing I recommend is to learn what the scientific method is. When you read an article check the source as fungussa stated. There is only one accepted version of science the world over. The laws of physics are the same in every country, as are the laws of gravity and our understandings of climate change.

What has happened in the US is the fossil fuel companies formed about 146 organizations to create confusion about the science and many people are 1. scientifically illiterate 2. want to hear that climate change is not happening. There are scientific studies about why people can't believe science. The human mind in many cases did not evolve quickly enough emotionally and cognitively to be able to process complex climate science. 

Once you understand how valid science is hypothesized, tested and reviewed by other scientists you can then look for articles that link to peer-reviewed papers that have passed the relevant testing and review. Accepted science is collectively assessed to have a level of certainty among scientists. 

Three of the most esteemed journals that publish climate science articles are PNAS ( the proceedings of the National Academies of Science), Nature and Science. There are many others. As mentioned Skeptical Science is great and very user friendly as are Climate Denial Crock of the Week videos and Al Jazzera, Vice TV and the BBC also have honest reporting and documentaries. NOAA, NASA, NSIDC, the IPCC, and the EPA are also some of the most prestigious entities for climate change data and presentations.

Expect total crap from the Daily Mail, Fox News, The Wall Street Journal etc. Lot's of mainstream media outlets publish pseudoscience as they are just businesses on the payroll. You can Google the Kochtopus to learn more about part of the climate change denial apparatus.

Are the articles you are reading produced or published by working climate scientists or people referring to their work? Any one can have an opinion.

You don't need to worry though as if you are not sure you can always post an article here to get feedback and there are a lot of really great people on this forum.

The good news is there is only one accepted version of science the world over and as Neil DeGrasse Tyson once said ""The great thing about science is that it is true whether you believe it or not.""

Very few articles on this forum are bogus and the mods are excellent at removing the few dishonest ones that get posted. You'll see dishonest posts here suffer a heavy pounding in the comments. There is a nice variety of articles and links posted here so this is a great place to peruse.

Good luck, thanks for asking, and please post any further questions that you have!

"d7ku8by","t3_52jveh","52jveh","climate","scientific","Science. Media without science is dubious.

Media: Blah says this current weather event *was caused by* climate change :: not likely to be based on fact, might be true but wait for science.

Media: Politician says this current weather event *was not caused by* climate change :: at least equally invalid as above.

Media: Scientist says xyz event is / is not caused by climate change, article does not link to science, but has graphs, maps, etc. :: you now have to investigate (a) the actual science (b) scientist's credentials, publications.

Media: Scientist says xyz event is / is not caused by climate change, article links to non-science lobby group pseudo science (e.g. Heartland, Marshal, Watts, Spencer blog) :: no.

Media: Scientist says xyz event is / is not caused by climate change, article links to actual science or respected scientific body :: possibly, read the science to ensure it actually confirms the publication, search for supporting science, confirm the scientist's credentials, publications.

It isn't easy. Build a library of places you generally trust (not me or Reddit) and places you know to be toxic.
