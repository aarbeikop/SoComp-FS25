Most importantly, we can vote for candidates who do not say that climate change is a hoax. We can support candidates with our votes and our donations. We can elect those who will work to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.

When a federal agency proposes a rule (these days, proposes to get rid of a regulation) that will reduce climate change we can comment on the regulation through regulations.gov.

On a personal level, we can reduce our use of energy. We can buy cars with the highest gas mileage or buy electric cars.

But the most important thing we can do is vote.","2018-11-26 17:21:40","4","JohnAS0420","1747947122.015392","climate alarmism","manual"

And don’t be condescending when doing it. Let the facts speak for themselves - there’s a good counter for every bad argument ","2018-11-24 21:14:16","3","Indominablesnowplow","1747947122.017102","climate alarmism","manual"

There is a hell of a lot we can do by working together, even with a small number of other people. I like to look at the power of the supply chain.  What are the things that we can do to support more businesses to reduce their emissions and those of their staff/customers. Greening the supply chain and looking for carbon neutral products or Certified B Corps will help a lot.

I would suggest to you that appearance of similarity regarding other ""incorrect"" environmental issues most likely is due to your receiving information primarily from sources which present it as similar to other environmental issues, which they then declare (correctly or not) were wrong.

> And even global warming has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations 

Nope, it's been the same for over one hundred years: CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases warm the planet's surface. Therefore increasing CO2 warms the planet's surface.","2018-11-05 14:12:42","3","skeeezoid","1747947123.4750478","climate alarmism","manual"

"e93zrv7","t3_9ud5pr","9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","You're right it has happened numerous times. And you are correct nature has bounced back. However, all those events took place over several thousand years.

This even will take place over several hundred. Neither nature nor organisms can adapt over a course of hundreds of years. If they do bounce back, it will be a drastically smaller amount of flora and fauna. If that happens, how do you prepare to feed the vast majority of people? How do you ensure the ecosystem stays stable?

That's the main focus: thousands of years yes you can adjust but hundreds, nature certainly cannot. I know this first hand. Snooker season was basically canceled in fort Myers in 2010 or 11 because a quick spike in temperature killed over 800 of this fish. I remember because it was a major news story. 

As I said nature can adapt but it cannot adapt in a short amount of time and that is what is occurring now. It is a normal process, but it is occurring TOO quickly compared to the past.","2018-11-05 18:51:32","1","KarakitIshtari","1747947123.484131","climate alarmism","manual"
"e94mijo","t3_9ud5pr","9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","I notice lately there is a lot of emphasis on the rate of increase of global temperature. 

We only have records for the last 170 years or so. Initially these were very scant records of global climate. Now we have data from the best available instruments. As good as the data is it represents only a small sample of the reality of the climate. 

Pre 1850 we have only proxies. The data is not a continuum but averages over a time period. The further back the greater the time period of averaging.

Averaging data removes the peaks and troughs. Rates of change can only be determined by that of the average. Fluctuations within the averaging range can not be determined.","2018-11-05 23:57:55","1","NewyBluey","1747947123.486752","climate alarmism","manual"
