This will never work, it is truly against the basics of human nature.  We are, at our core resource hoarders.  It worked very well for us as cave people and we are basically still cave people.  Trump is the example, 39% of people follow him regardless of how little he understands of policy, politics etc... he channels the inner cave person very well.  Shake the fist and say we are going to be great again!  That is the reality of the human condition; we are essentially still cave people.

The only way this gets fixed is somehow turn this into a cave people argument which will be very difficult to do.  In the U.S. we have enough ground, enough resources, and enough technology to essentially switch to the entire electrical grid to solar from coal in a 10 year time frame.  It will be expensive, require a war level of production mobilization, and likely nationalization of the power infrastructure.  When you look at WWII, the total amount of production in our nation was staggering.  It took 10 years to basically recover from that period (real incomes recovered in the 50's, unemployment recovered in the 60's).  This is pretty much the only way to salvage this now. 

Additionally, we will need to conquer Afghanistan (politically preferably) or other lithium rich countries to start creating batteries to store power while at the same time increasing the cost of fossil fuels to encourage the switch.  

Unfortunately, we have an entire political party that panders to people building wagon wheels while the rest of the world is building jets.  They have somehow convinced a large part of our population that this is somehow a threat to them and their way of life.  They take advantage of the people that have no idea how economies operate but instead thump their chest and talk about glory days.  

On the other side of the issue we have a green movement that seems to believe that the only way out of this is go live in caves again.  That is not a tenable position, never has been and likely will never be in the future.  We are materialistic cave people that protect and hoard our possessions like children.  Demanding this change will continue to fail until there is a change in humanity and that is unlikely to happen on any reasonable time scale. 

So here most of us are, stuck in the middle.  Wanting a solution but on one side we have people that deny science against the people that think we need to live in caves.  Combined with a political system that seems to pride itself now on just blocking the opposition rather than comprise and progress.  

China is, thanks to our politicians, going to be the next world super power.  They seem to understand leadership, look how they invest in foreign governments without interference.  They are switching off coal because it is the right thing to do for the world.  Now India is trying to follow suit and is becoming the worlds largest market for solar.  India has created 1M solar jobs and China created 3.5M solar jobs. Meanwhile in America we sit here trying to protect [69,000](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics4_212100.htm) coal miners and [172,000](http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag211.htm#iag211emp1.f.P) oil workers in industry that not only is dying, but must die for the sake of humanity.   

Make America Great again my ass...  for the record I'm not with her either...
