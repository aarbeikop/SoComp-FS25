Where they do differ substantially is in socio-economic assumptions, which affect vulnerability to climate impacts. A1B assumes higher rates of economic development in emerging nations and a dramatic drop in fertility rates such that 2100 population falls to 7 billion. A2 assumes lower rates of economic development in emerging nations and a muted decline in fertility rate resulting in 2100 population of 15 billion.","2019-05-23 12:18:52","4","skeeezoid","1747950365.898647","climate alarmism","manual"
