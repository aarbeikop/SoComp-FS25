All the most guilty 1%ers, who paid for the denial PR campaign, will scapegoat everyone of these true believer/useful idiots when the time comes. Their type has been doing it since time immemorial - a staple in the ruling class play book.","2016-04-07 21:11:22","1","[deleted]","1747919164.467048","climate alarmism","manual"

> In November 2004, climate change skeptic Richard Lindzen was quoted saying he'd be willing to bet that the earth's climate will be cooler in 20 years than it is today. When British climate researcher James Annan contacted him, however, Lindzen would only agree to take the bet if Annan offered a 50-to-1 payout.
