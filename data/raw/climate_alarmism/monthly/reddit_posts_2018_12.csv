"a2ds9d","climate","scientific","Is climate change really a big deal?","First off I do know that man-made climate change is very real and I'm not a denier/moron.

The government report on climate change says that in the **worst-case** scenario, the US will lose more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century.

And I'm like... so what? Why should that have me worrying for humanity? Why should a drop of 1.3% in dairy production one century from now be of any concern to anyone? I mean in the past when I though of climate change I thought that maybe in 2040 or 2050 human civilization would start to collapse, apocalyptic wars over water would be fought, billions would die from heat, starvation, etc... In reality all it does is some minor and barely noticeable economic recession... an entire century away.

Is this what climate change scientists want us to be so alarmed about?","2018-12-02 14:51:05","0","16","0.11","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/a2ds9d/is_climate_change_really_a_big_deal/","True","Sharia4Canada","1747947702.383222","climate alarmism","manual"
