"9qz367","climatechange","action-oriented","Some thoughts about the climate change...","I have had several thoughts about the climate change issue:

&#x200B;

1. The shutting down of debate is counterproductive; it does nothing to convince deniers & possibly swings abstainers to the denial side. Reasoned discussion is essential, even if it does become tiresome repeating the same points over & over.

&#x200B;

2. If a small human-made change to climate can be amplified to produce a large effect, then that implies that a small reverse adjustment could also easily fix it later.

&#x200B;

3. The lack of any clear explanation of how the massive climate changes of the last 100 million years fits with recent climate history. This suggests we're doomed anyway within the next 500-2000 years when the next ice-age kicks-in.

&#x200B;

4. If we are about enter a new ice-age within the next 500-2000 years, is it possible that human-made global warming could be used to stabilise global climate to prevent a new ice-age from happening at all?

&#x200B;

5. The more alarming the climate scientists warnings become, the more I hope they are mistaken, because I believe economic/political forces will prevent any effective action until it is too late.

&#x200B;

I'm genuinely interested to hear peoples responses to my points above.

&#x200B;

PS - I'm not a climate change denier, or even a skeptic, more of a climate agnostic... :)","2018-10-24 12:14:33","0","37","0.36","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9qz367/some_thoughts_about_the_climate_change/","True","ad1mt","1747946580.2865222","climate alarmism","manual"

I'm French and part of the citizen for climate movement that started in France in September 8th. We walked everywhere in the country to show our opposition to capitalism over consumerism and the lobbies. We walked again everywhere in France and in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany the 13th of October! We are now making. Connections with other European countries and want this movement to become a global movement. We will walk again for green Friday on November 23rd and again the 8th of December during the cop-24! The 8th of December is called climate alarm and needs to become an enormous global Mobilisation of citizens, associations and any human being who doesn't want this system to kill us! 

We have a French Facebook group of 80k people https://www.facebook.com/groups/1630479090389945/ we also work on discord to organise actions against our politicians, governments, we are developing a citizen lobbying tool to campaign against the same guys. Here is the American mother group that we created https://www.facebook.com/groups/2262372540500089/ we need people in the US and anywhere else to create their city subgroups and make this an international citizen movement. We need a citizen revolution to make sure we can have a future and that future generations can too!
