"dicmjb","climatechange","action-oriented","The Layman's Guide to the Greatest Scientific Fraud in History (new book on climate alarm fraud)","You’re going to learn about the greatest fraud which has ever, and which  could ever, occur in science. The audacity of the fraud is matched only  by its simplicity. The amazing thing is that anyone, down to  Kindergarten children, can see the fraud and appreciate it as a fraud,  while almost no scientist, particularly physicists at universities,  cannot and refuse to. Strange!   


This book will give you all of  the information that you need to debunk what is now the single greatest  political and scientific fraud in history. It doesn't matter what else  the other side tries to plead, it doesn't matter what ""data"" they  emotionally believe themselves to be referring to - absolutely nothing  that they say about their ploy will be taken seriously any longer. This  books debunks their narrative at step one, and everything else they say  afterwards is junk pseudoscience.

"dk8nad","climatechange","action-oriented","The IPCC should rely more on history books than on computer models.","""Flooding, dryness, heat or cold waves: Today everything is supposed to be a sign of the apocalypse - this was not always the case. Whenever the sun shines for a few days in a row and it gets warmer than 30 degrees or longer rains fall and the water levels of the rivers rise, some media and ""experts"" claim that climate change is now hitting with full force. A look at history shows that there have always been weather capers and that people knew how to deal with them as well as with their consequences, without immediately developing hysterical end-of-the-world fantasies. This is also the case in the Saxon capital Dresden.

Persistently high temperatures and the resulting droughts plagued the people here as early as 1473, 1504, 1563, 1590, 1616, 1642, 1790 (at that time, this even led to the Kursachsen Peasant Uprising), 1842, 1874, 1893, 1904, 1911, 1921, 1934, 1935 and 1954. The chronicle of the city council for 1473 reported: ""Summer was so hot and dry that drinking water was only available for money"". And in 1590 it was said: ""Because of great drought the mills stopped. The Elbe was almost dried up."" The latter also happened in 1954, when the level of the river fell below ten centimetres and once again the legendary ""starvation stones"" appeared on the ground.

If it wasn't too hot and too dry or too wet, severe frost became a problem. This occurred in particular in the years 1416, 1466, 1524, 1597, 1612, 1664 and 1673 to 1679, whereby the cold waves in the 17th century were effects of the so-called ""Little Ice Age"". Now the mills failed instead of due to lack of water due to icing, and in the woods ""many hundreds of deer ... fell dead"". In addition to hunger, there was also a shortage of wine, because the frost already set in in late summer and the grapes spoiled.

The biggest weather-related scourge of the population in Dresden, which lies directly on the Elbe, was of course the constantly recurring, devastating floods, during which the level of the river rose over seven metres, which would today lead to the declaration of the highest possible alarm level.

Between the years 1200 and 2013 there must have been around 35 such extreme flood events. This means that the alleged ""millennium floods"" of 2002 (Elbe gauge at the Augustus Bridge next to the Residenz Castle: 9.40 metres) and 2013 (gauge: 8.76 metres) were by no means one-off events and thus indications of the alleged climate change in the present. Water levels were similarly high in 1845 (8.77 metres), 1501 and 1784 (8.57 metres each), 1655 (8.38 metres), 1862 and 1799 (8.24 metres each).

There are no concrete measurements from the time before, which is why it is quite possible that the river swelled even more dramatically in the past. For example, during the legendary ""Magdalene Flood"" of July 1342, which afflicted the whole of Central Europe, or in the terrible flood years 1272, 1275, 1318, 1400, 1430 and 1432. Taking into account the damage mentioned in old documents, water levels of more than ten metres are conceivable.""","2019-10-19 19:44:28","0","65","0.31","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dk8nad/the_ipcc_should_rely_more_on_history_books_than/","True","LackmustestTester","1747953029.0784","climate alarmism","manual"
"di63zr","collapse","skeptical","Insect Die Off + 500 Million Bees Found Dead In Brazil","We invented gene mod foods to withstand poison. Insect poison, and weed poison. Any plant you cannot make money from is called a ""weed"". Herbicides kill all normal plants. Just 3 neonic seeds will kill one bird. Birds need plants and insects to live. Poisoning birds, insects, fish and frogs is not a net positive survival benefit. Herbicides allow us to plant corn closer together. We are draining our groundwater reserves for something we burn in our cars.

We didn't invent gene mod foods to feed the people of earth, we invented them for money, and power. The power comes from weaponizing seeds. Goats in India were killed off by eating gene modded cotton stalks. Nobody gave a fuck, but in February of this year, we found out we in the throes of a massive insect die off.

Google funded climate denialists and took money to discredit bad news from Monsanto. Google is the most powerful media company in the world. YouTube is the second largest search engine on earth. Accusing Google will bug some people on this sub more than Monsanto's destruction of insects. This divide and distract effort is used to disconnect Monsanto from the insect die offs. Ask yourself, have you ever heard of bee die offs and Monsanto in the same sentence, you can thank Google and MSM for that.

There are 25 billion chickens on earth, they form 70% of global avian biomass, the other 30% are dying off due to the plastic and chemical poisoning of their food, ask any seagull what's on the menu today, and they'll say plastic. Google is not your friend, MSM is not your friend, I am not your friend. If you want a friend, you have to actually ignore your phone and talk to real people.
