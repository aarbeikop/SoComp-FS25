Reading through the comments is a bit of a shitshow with both climate alarmists and denialist’s criticizing it for disagreeing with both of them and very little actual good discussion unfortunately (but that’s the norm for YouTube it seems).

I have an interest in learning more about the role of methane feedbacks, particularly from gas hydrates. However it can be hard as a layman to make sense of a lot of the conflicting views on this topic, ranging from the seemingly more accepted view that methane hydrates will pose little threat this century, to the extreme view that methane hydrates will go off and bring about the apocalypse within our lifetimes.

Which brings me to Natalia Shakova. It seems like the more alarmist voices consider her findings to be the gold standard when it comes to this topic, and from what I can tell most of the methane alarmism that has become recently popular largely originated with her findings on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf and her concerns of a large release being feasible.

What I am wondering is what is the actual view of her and her work in the scientific community? From what I’m aware her view that huge quantities of hydrates exist is controversial, but I don’t know much else about her work and whether it is being accurately presented by random people online.","2019-02-10 02:23:27","6","19","0.76","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/aozoft/what_is_the_opinion_of_the_scientific_community/","True","STOPSENDINGMEHENTAI","1747948752.251636","climate alarmism","manual"

It’s unravelling faster and faster. Feedbacks loops and unintended consequences showing up all the time.

“What we are now witnessing is extremely worrying,” said one of the paper’s lead authors, Professor Euan Nisbet of Royal Holloway, University of London. “It is particularly alarming because we are still not sure why atmospheric methane levels are rising across the planet.”


“Natural chemicals in the atmosphere – which help to break down methane – may be changing because of temperature rises, causing it to lose its ability to deal with the gas.

Our world could therefore be losing its power to cleanse pollutants because it is heating up, a climate feedback in which warming allows more greenhouse gases to linger in the atmosphere and so trigger even more warming.”","2019-02-17 08:24:11","64","27","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/arip2v/sharp_rise_in_methane_threatens_world_climate/","True","Littlearthquakes","1747949159.944701","climate alarmism","manual"
