Keep the subjects light from now on: sports, how's work, family stuff. Don't stress yourself out trying to change his mind. He will keep sending you right wing junk science and you'll never make any progress.

Edit: he has quoted every single one of the worst offenders for conservative junk science bullshit. Hilarious. ","2015-01-14 16:17:22","1","[deleted]","1747893005.158648","climate alarmism","manual"

"cncv3ju","t3_2r5tqa","2r5tqa","collapse","skeptical","I'm old enough that I won't experience the longterm collapses of climate change and peak resources. But, I'm young enough that a sharp or prolonged economic collapse could easily mean that I remain a wage slave my entire life with no prospect for any relief from that even with diminished capacity for meaningful work. I fear an economic collapse where those clinging to the lower rungs of middle class are kicked right to the streets. I fear a scenario where 70 year olds fight for pitiful part time jobs cleaning public toilets.

Collapse can be societal or it can be personal or both. For too many, their personal collapse has already occurred. The sheer number of people who are one medical situation or one economic ripple away from being destitute in one of the wealthiest countries on Earth is staggering. And the number of folks well past 65 who have already had to take menial jobs at Walmart, in fast food service or cleaning rest stops should be a warning sign that we are precariously close to a world in which lifelong wage slavery until death is the new norm.

The other aspect of this collapse by a million personal collapses that is quite fear inspiring is the privatization of *everything*. We're not that far from having to purchase the very basics for human survival. It's basically impossible to live in this world without some form of income and official tracking, and that is a form of collapse of human rights that will lead to a lot of other collapse scenarios.","2015-01-03 04:44:48","13","Independent","1747893846.367816","climate alarmism","manual"

In the long term, even if I've been working hard into reducing life expectations and am getting used to frugal living as fast as I can, I fear not being able to adapt physically to the shortcomings and new career changes (massive povertization and increase of informal and agrarian economy) necessary to adapt to the situation.","2015-01-03 11:53:37","3","[deleted]","1747893846.3834329","climate alarmism","manual"

"cnjtbq1","t3_2r5tqa","2r5tqa","collapse","skeptical","I've got a few things.

I try to prepare for shortages or for things being straight-up unavailable because that is a symptom of many different collapse scenarios and it keeps me prepared without getting too bogged down with the exact cause of my troubles.

For instance, I'm concerned about running out of food.  Maybe there are food shortages due to peak oil, or maybe due to climate change, or maybe the food is there but I can't afford it for some reason.  I garden and had fruit trees and things at my old house, but I never grew anywhere close to enough food to eat year round.  I just moved into a house on 40 acres where I plan on greatly increasing the amount of food that I grow, but I sitll won't be fully self-sufficient anytime soon even if I am successful.

I'm concerned with running ot of medicine.  I have seasonal allergies and will survive without medicine, but my quality of life would go down considerably.  My wife has a serious medical issue that basically requires modern medication, though.

I'm concerned about prolonged power outages for whatever reason.  That translates into no heat and no cooking among other things.  I am well prepared for this, but it wouldn't be easy without electricity for an extended amount of time.

I'm concerned about no more running water.  I have a small lake on my property, but getting that water from the lake to my house and treating it every time I want to use it wouldn't be fun.

I'm concerned about not being able to pay my bills and my house and land being foreclosed on.  I have a good job now and a small emergency fund, but it's small.  If collapse is bad and I lose my job without a safety net, then I'd be in trouble. On the plus side, hopefully the banks wouldn't be too up to date on foreclosures, but honestly that's probably the last thing that they would stop doing.","2015-01-09 20:23:48","1","derrick81787","1747893846.394867","climate alarmism","manual"
