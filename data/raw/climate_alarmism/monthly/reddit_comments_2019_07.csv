But I hate my mother for being so selfishly herself, as if she is more important than all of the people to come after her. 

&#x200B;

I am excavating a back garden from the concrete she put down, for the convenience, it sickens me that this wasted space has been there for so long.   


The fags, that I accepted long ago are killing her and am surprised that she has lasted this long, have produced a high pile of useless rubbish. The addiction is more important though.

  
The presents are nice. I do not want clothes that have already polluted the earth, because of their production, and going to continue to pollute because they are made with plastic. I do not need them.  I do not want the plastic toy that was mass produced in a factory and shipped half way across the earth to be of no use, what so ever! I do not need it! I do not need non reusable hand warmers, I don't use reusable hand warmers. I don't need a lot.  


The outlook of ""treat yoself"" has probably meant that she was more detrimental to my future than my mostly absent, alcoholic, abusive father ever could have been. He has planted a garden. Bought local. Forgotten to buy presents. raised animals. walked/cycled around. kept fit(ish), so the calls to the doctors and medical necessities were not frequent as hers. Thanks to her I am here and still alive.   


Thanks to knowledge I can try to make a better life for, hopefully, my children.","2019-07-02 15:10:04","1","Laugh_At_My_Name_","1747951530.16237","climate alarmism","manual"

The UK government were already discussing Climate Change in 1998, after the Easter Floods

[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1998/oct/20/easter-floods](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1998/oct/20/easter-floods)

*Does the Minister agree that,* ***although, as the review acknowledges, the conditions at Easter were exceptional, the prospect of climate change means that such exceptional conditions may become more frequent?*** *Surely  that not only reinforces the need for the reconsideration of flood preparations that the Minister has put in hand, but makes even more  urgent* ***the need for the Government to publish their own, long overdue, climate change strategy***\*.\*

Here's the Clinton Administration's take on it in Sep 2000

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/912599.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/912599.stm)

*President Clinton's chief adviser on climate change* ***says the strength of the scientific argument that global warming is happening is ""absolute""****.*

Between Oct-Nov 2000, most of W. Europe got hit by some of the largest river floods ever recorded [http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/\~mike/extremes/](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~mike/extremes/)

*""The Autumn (Fall) season of 2000 saw record rainfall and widespread  flooding in western Europe. It was* ***the wettest Autumn in England and Wales since records began in 1766***\*, and\* ***several regions from France to Norway received double their average rainfall.****""*

Alarm bells have been ringing loudly for some time, the response has been for people to stick their earplugs in and blindfolds on.

It's 700 hectares that burned. According to google, the average yield for 1 hectare of wheat is 9.3 tons. That means 6500 tons of wheat are gone.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_wheat_production_statistics , France produced 37,000,000 tons of wheat in 2017. That event would have costed France nearly 0.02% of its total wheat production.

Mitigation is about concentration, 450ppm is a fuck load better than 850ppm.

Adaption is about moving off fossil fuels so we don't get to stupid levels and recgonise what needs to be done to do that eg no more airports, moving infrasture away from sea levels and flood plains, switching to PT and bikes (escooters/pedelecs for inner city living)) and rail for intra city transport (hydrogen or electricity there), no more fucking highway upgrades, changing building codes building out wind and solar.  Hell it's it's illegal to build in Austria to meet the changing climate, as this article shows.

We aren't going to stop 1.5/2100, nor 2/2100, we still have some chance of stopping 4/2100 but even that's running away and that doesn't acknowledge that 2200 etc will he hotter again.  4C is ,likely end of civilisation and could come sooner the 2100.

So..what to do ?

Most of those who turn a blind eye don’t truly know the problem, it doesn’t effect them. If this information and the reliability of so many of these resources and ecosystems was presented to mankind showing how it sustains human life it would become more important. Mankind truly destroys all it comes in contact with, it’s a sad reality, but it’s the truth. There is more potential in the world. I’ve had it told to me many times that Homo sapiens are the only species that can think about long term future gains. The example is with the study on chimpanzees, I believe. Researchers have placed food inside a basket (something a monkey would want to eat, obviously) and let the monkey try to get it out through the gaps and openings in the basket. Monkeys apparently only think of the now rather than the long term sustainability of not eating whatever’s in the basket for the sake of using your hand to its full potential. I think even as a human species our long term processing only goes so far and in the long run decisions are made that benefit us in the now as opposed to long term sustainability of the very resources keeping us alive.","2019-07-01 23:19:24","4","ashleybrantner","1747951882.836172","climate alarmism","manual"
