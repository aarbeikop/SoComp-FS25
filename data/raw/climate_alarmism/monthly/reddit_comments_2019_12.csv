Wrong. Global warming has absolutely nothing to do with the greenhouse effect (aka convection limiting).

Co2 absorbs IR at specific wavelengths... it also EMITS just as well. AKA its a better conductor of heat then normal air. Because of this ability to conduct those specific wavelengths of light more efficently, Co2 is predicted to lower upper atmospheric temperatures, which contracts the global surface area of the ""atmopsheric window"" where Co2 finally allows IR through to space(around 2.7 and 15 um). This contraction is the where the heating is predicted to come from.

For visualization, imagine a fluffy ball of wire, with a piece of red hot plutonium inside. the wire conducts heat away from the plutonium core and radiates it into space. The plutonium is earth and the wire is the atmosphere. Co2 has the effect of increasing the thermal conductivity(plastic to cooper) of the wires(atmosphere) to such a degree that the entire ball of wires shrinks, reducing surface area that can radiate heat. The core of plutonium is still putting off X number of watts, but in a smaller ball of wire. Because the ball of wire shrunk, the temperature delta would be greater, and thus any point inside of the surface layer would be marginally hotter.

To date... this has not been proven... mostly because there is no evidence that the [Mie scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering) layer has actually lowered in altitude, as climate models predicted. We are talking about 5-10 meters of change for this layer, at 5-10 km in altitude.

"fbdgiwt","t3_ecsl55","ecsl55","collapse","skeptical","The beginning of this post highlights something fundamental; you say we need to reduce x% over 10 years (also arbitrary).

We don't have 10 years. 10 years of reinforcing feedbacks that increase non-linearly cannot be left for 10 years. These are ideas that would have been feasible decades ago. I think it was 1990 when the UN Advisory on GHG's said that just 1C would elicit unpredictable, non-reversible catastrophic damage to the planet. 

We are much closer to 2C, and every rise in degree makes the next rise that much quicker/easier. We are out of time, we should keep trying, but to pretend that we are turning this ship around at this point is an impossible notion.

Wind turbines do not use wood in their blades due to the weight that would require and the adverse effect that would have on the strength of the blade. Fiber-reinforced epoxy or unsaturated polyester is much stronger, lighter weight, and doesnt fly apart under its own momentum like wood would (lol). Its kinda why they use it...

Its basically 6-10 inch thick specialized fiberglass. At this thickness the composite is nothing like the quarter inch or less thick old fashioned fiberglass surrounding your boat. More like lightweight steel.  It is amazing to look at theses blades and understand the complexity of these seemingly simple blades. The blade or airfoil needs to have smooth contours as much as possible. Any noise is air resistance and any sharp edge will allow harmonics to build up or cause stress points. Harmonics obviously destroy the drive train. A good blade design is crucial.

Let's say I made the final decision on this. It's fair to assume that I had the public on one side asking for investment into renewables, and a shady fossil fuel company on the other side who I've got a preexisting relationship with.

The most financially beneficial action for me would be to ask the lobbyists to funnel me cash in exchange for sabotaging the project, then follow through on that by going with an unfeasibly cheap option and diverting excess funds to areas that get me votes.

Win-win for me, win-win for my fossil fuel friends who benefit from both the shitty service quality of the renewables and the public losing faith in them when a wind turbine crumbles.

I could also probably blame the next few 'whoopsie daisy' budget moments on 'those damn things we have to keep paying to fix'.","2019-12-06 14:13:55","1","ManWithDominantClaw","1747954549.259556","climate alarmism","manual"
