"d35a7st","t3_4jbigy","4jbigy","collapse","skeptical","Here's your problem:  You're trying to make Alex Jones make sense.

It's fascinating to watch how he tries to weave current events into his overall globalist narrative, but he doesn't care if there are holes or hanging threads, and neither does his audience.  It's all about what works *right now* to maintain or expand his audience and sell more water purifiers or whatever.

If anything, he is useful to the globalist elites because he keeps a segment of the population distracted, confused, emotionally raw but also perpetually inert.  They don't do much but listen and wait.  They don't trust their neighbours so they aren't likely to form any grassroots movements.  Not that an Alex Jones was created by the globalist elites, but he's there so they might as well take advantage.

I figure he partly believes and partly knows he's full of shit.","2016-05-14 14:59:24","27","candleflame3","1747920632.881676","climate alarmism","manual"

The problem I see, and this is a general human problem, is the confirmation bias. We try to seek confirmation for the opinion we already have and ignore counterfactual data. This is even affects science and is usually referred as a paradigm. If you look at physics for example, there are so many papers actually contradicting our standard model , but if you use a different one, you are seen as a nut job. It is absurd :)

"d3e28xf","t3_4ka6of","4ka6of","collapse","skeptical","This anecdotal stuff doesn't prove much, but yes. I had some kind of viral illness in February that lasted six weeks. That is very unusual for me. It seemed like it might be some kind of low-grade pneumonia or whooping cough. Some friends had a similar thing. One of them went to a doctor who just said ""it's a viral infection, get some rest."" One got on Tamiflu which she claimed helped shorten it, but you have to take it very early in the illness.

I wrote in my blog on January 30th:

Well. This month has been, pretty much, a complete bust as far as reading goes. I've been sick with a flu virus that has really knocked me down.

My symptoms have not been that severe -- just a mild fever and cough and occasional headache -- but it has dragged on, and the mental haze and physical exhaustion that go with it have been really frustrating. It's been two weeks, and I'm not quite done with it. I took a little some sick time, but I hate taking sick time and I had critical work to get done. So I went back to work, and was able to get some crucial work done, but wasn't able to do much else. In the evenings I'd just fade out early. I took cough medicines and acetaminophen to get me through, and had lots of hot tea and broth. I was able to drag myself through the week, but it was really a slog.

Then this note in my blog about March 1st: 

""My coughing illness went on for weeks and weeks. I was considering going to a doctor, but after the first week, there was little or no fever, and at no time did it seem like a bacterial infection. I just felt wrung-out and awful, with a nasty, unproductive cough. Doctors can't do a whole lot about viral illnesses, so I assumed that any competent doctor would just send me home advising me to get some extra rest and drink extra fluids. So I just tried to do that, and soldiered on... for another month.

By week five, I started thinking I really should go see a doctor, because I just wasn't getting much better. But then my condition finally improved dramatically. My voice came back, and my energy came back. It just took a long time. I don't know exactly what to make of it. I think part of it may be the weird winter weather this year, which has been freeze, thaw, freeze, thaw, freeze, thaw, over and over, perhaps leaving me afflicted with some unusual winter allergies. And I think part of my slow recovery might be attributable to the stress of my weekly separations from my family, and also to job stress, as we raced to get ready for a product launch.""

"d3eokyj","t3_4ka6of","4ka6of","collapse","skeptical","No.  In the contrary, in the last decade I made two major lifestyle changes, and since then I colds and flus have become *much* rarer for me and when I do get them they are weaker and pass much more quickly.  Basically before I got an average of two viral (cold or flu) infections per year that knocked me out for at least a few days, plus some others that made me suffer without taking me out of commission.  Today I hardly get any... like in the last year I've had one week of a bit of a sore throat that troubled my sleep a bit but I hardly noticed during the day.

What are those two lifestyle changes?

1) Quit smoking. 'nough said.  Except that my experience has been that for about 2 to 3 years after quitting one can actually be *more* susceptible to respiratory infections of all kinds... thereafter there is a big drop.

2) Sleeping more and more regularly.  Before I slept an average of 6.5 hours per night, with quite a bit of variation night-to-night.  I thought that's all I needed.  But now I sleep 8-9 hours very regularly, i.e. I go to sleep between 9 and 10 and wake up at 6, every day.  There seems to be quite a bit of scientific evidence emerging that this makes a big difference for the immune system... I can only say that anecdotally for me it seems to have done that.

I keep some at work for when I get a sniffle or sneeze because someone came to work with a cold.  I take one and no more sniffles or sneezes.  In the winter I take one at night and one in the morning.     ","2016-05-20 21:56:48","-3","[deleted]","1747920715.617959","climate alarmism","manual"
