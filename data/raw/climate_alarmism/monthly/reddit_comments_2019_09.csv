This is the lack of imagination that sees the end of civilisation.  This lack of prescience can't even imagine that it will end let alone it's ending and how to imagine coming out the other side.  This lack of imagination sees voters electing the same politicians and trying the same things to achieve different outcomes. This lack of imagination won't even let them wrap their heads round that their might be better ways of doing things, that the systems we've used habe and will fail the VAST MAJORITY and extolling them to try harder to join the destructive processes is the very thing we shouldn't be doing.  

This lack of imagination could see our extinction... I sometimes wonder if that is indeed such a bad thing ?  The only thing that curtails me from wishing it is the endless suffering that will be endured by the mostly undeserving but is that any different from now for the vast majority ?

Decades of ""sooner than expected"" & ""worse than projected"", CO^2 is higher than ever, emissions are higher than ever (still *increasing*, not even stalled much less decreasing), more people than ever with more on the way, AMOC has already started slowing and *still* it's controversial to say out loud ""there are going to be some disasters no matter what we do"".

If you watch the house burn for an hour before you call the fire department, you're going to have some damage to the house. It's like projecting the path of a hurricane.

"ezoakyj","t3_d1nomt","d1nomt","collapse","skeptical","I wonder what the tipping point will be?  Will it be individual countries that come together and realize what is happening and what is at stake, or will it get to the point where a coalition of countries comes together to enforce what they see as what ""must be done"" to mitigate the coming storm?  Personally I give the odds of humanity doing what it takes to keep us from 6C at less than 5%.  If our species previous examples of what our reactions will be are any indicator then we are well are truly fucked. The countdown to when we had a chance to prevent catastrophy passed about 5-10 years ago.  

People are far to used to what affects them day to day.  Humanity just can't comprehend the threat that is here.  I have been studying geologic and sociological history most of my life and the numbers involved are mind-blowing.  Example. If you take the history of the earth and stretch it out from your arm to your fingertips, and you take a nail file and make ONE swipe across your nails you would wipe out homo sapians from the record.  In a land of the internet and Kardashians that attention span has been made shorter by orders of magnitude.  It would almost make a good plot to a sci-fi novel. 


The end has begun and still it continues.  In 2005 gov. Rick Scott forbade the use of the term ""climate change"". You would get fired from your job if you even said the term. And this is in FLORIDA.   Fuck. Our species hasn't even gotten past racism or even sexism yet.  What it will take to save us from the coming storm will take a lot more than that.   

Gene Roddenberry had it right.  The only way we will get through this is if we give up capitalism. (somehow). Come together as a species. And begin to live proactively. Lots and lots of people will die. At this point, nothing can be done about this. (technoites will try to tell you that we will invent out way out of this).  

Homo Sapians is an incredibly intelligent species. But in a group we are dumb animals. Society, even the most advanced and wealthy societies are reactionary. And facing this threat, reactionary will be our downfall.   We will not change before it is too late. My only hope is that the few that are lucky enough to survive what is to come will apply that knowledge. 

Nuclear is the only option.  Fusion would be better, but only if it comes after the fall otherwise it will only encourage the behavior that got us into this mess. ""necessity is the mother of invention"".  I certainly hope so at this point.","2019-09-09 08:55:23","64","VolkspanzerIsME","1747952671.406794","climate alarmism","manual"

Yes the fish deaths are disastrous, yes the conditions are really bad out there. However, the Darling River system a) has a looooot of ephemeral tributaries (naturally don't always flow) and b) is largely in an area with natural average rainfall of 300mm/year and less. The areas of the basin with higher average inflows are far away from the crisis areas, and we lose so much water to transmission losses and evaporation. Have a look on Google Earth where this river runs. Look at the surrounds. 

Eastern Australia is suffering from a horrible drought right now, which Australia has always suffered, and the river is struggling because of that. Let's not let that detract from the climate emergency, but in the same way that 'its cold today therefore climate change is a myth' is bad science, a massive drought in Australia doesn't mean collapse is imminent.","2019-09-09 10:49:29","4","[deleted]","1747952671.4319448","climate alarmism","manual"
