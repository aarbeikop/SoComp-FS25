"bx55oy","climatechange","action-oriented","""There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change""...is not a scientific fact, it's the opposite","Recently a journalistic conference was convened in America (jointly by the *Columbia Journalism Review* and the *The Nation*) to survey the state of American journalism on climate change. 

Criticisms of US coverage abounded — but the criticisms also abounded with errors. In the keynote article ""[The Media Are Complacent While the World Burns](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/climate-change-media.php)"" one finds this passage:

>There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. 

This statement is definitely NOT a statement of scientific fact — which doesn't deal in metaphors like runaway trains. The statement qualifies as magical thinking at least, and probably alarmism too.

Conference participants presumably had some more substantive criticisms of US climate coverage. Although I bet hardly any of them were more substantive than Chris Hayes' observation from 2018:

> Hayes (who is an editor at large for *The Nation*) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, “All In With Chris Hayes” spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”

American journalism covers climate in three distinct ways: 

1) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Denier audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support.  

2) Validating the beliefs of the Climate Doomer audience, with the most spectacular assertions one can find which possess a minimum amount of scientific support. This is what's happening with the ""runaway train"" quote here.

3) Serving the audience which is actually interested in the science of climate. This audience doesn't have many beliefs which go beyond what can be shown by analytic methods. The real task of this strain of journalism is to expand the range of what can be shown by analytic methods. It's probably best to call this strain ""(actual) science journalism,"" rather than mainstream journalism.

It's stupid to fault American journalism (or any journalism) for serving the first two audiences. That's the explicit task of much mainstream journalism: To serve and form a relationship with the largest audience they can reach. Many people are more interested in having their beliefs validated than in having them analyzed (or challenged). These audiences will always exist.

The real question is: How large is that third audience? Is there a chance that it might grow to the size of the other two? If it does, then mainstream journalism will have to yield some space to more ""(actual) science journalism.""

But the keynote article for the CJR/Nation conference gives me no hope that *that* particular set of journalism watchers intends to take a single step in that direction. They're in the validating-beliefs mode, not the analytical mode. 

Plenty of analytical-mode writers publish all the time. There's no need to pay a single moment's attention to the largest mainstream outlets (for instance, network television news operations). But you have to search for them. And complaining about the belief-validating sections of the media doesn't actually make the search easier.","2019-06-05 17:17:52","13","102","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bx55oy/there_is_a_runaway_train_racing_toward_us_and_its/","True","DocHarford","1747950860.062419","climate alarmism","manual"
"c0v42k","climatechange","action-oriented","Climate change debates - Where are they???","I simply want to ask if anyone knows of any videos of mainstream climate change debates outside of McKibben vs. Epstein. I've searched youtube pretty deep into the results and their debate was virtually all I could find, which is pretty alarming.

It would be nice to get a list going, assuming that's not the only video.

I'd also like to see any non-video debates people may know of.

I'm a big believer in debate's ability to guide us to the truth, and I really hope the corrupt DNC will make ACC more of an issue.

Thanks.","2019-06-15 08:20:30","4","62","0.64","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/c0v42k/climate_change_debates_where_are_they/","True","shaggytits","1747950867.114623","climate alarmism","manual"
"bwnb7z","collapse","skeptical","Climate Scientists Are Clueless About Collapse","The plethora of collapse drivers work together to compound, accelerate and exponentiate collapse. These drivers impact us more than the mere summation of their number.

When climate scientists talk of climate collapse by 2050, they have no clue because of reticence and specialty myopia. They can't see the BIG picture. Paul Beckwith has admitted as much. He's one of the good ones.

Take the isolation imposed by social media. A climate scientist is not going to talk about alienation and loneliness. 

Collapse timing is a spectrum, where immediate nuclear war is on the far left, and climate change is on the far right. Even political discourse will have a Chaos Theory implication for collapse timing. Things can turn to shit faster than expected. Between the left/right spectrum lay all kinds of biological, ecological and behavioral drivers that affect collapse timing.
 
For example, society is shedding paper media like crazy, so if we have an early network collapse, what will you read or even write on? We're cramming so many mini-satellites in space they threaten network collapse.

Collapse is a way deeper subject than even collapsers appreciate.

We inconsequentially eat computer designed synthetic DNA.
 
We eat GMO food soaked in poison from pesticides and herbicides.

We process that food with chemical preservatives and enhancers.

We ship food in containers that leech petrochemicals into it.

Our water and air is metal laden, fluorine-carbon infused, ozone suffused, and petro-pharma chemically laced in poisons. 

Micro/nano plastics and metals are breaking down the blood/brain barrier opening up our minds to contamination and behavioral problems.

Electro-magnetic fields for wifi/cellular signals are affecting all animal life causing a host of brain and health malfunctions.

Flood, fire and ill weather affect us mentally and physically.

Social media amplifies mental and physical illness.

Each of the above drivers impact and compound each other, from down to the chemical and micro-biological level, all the way up to the social/civil level.

The food, water and air is affecting our behavior and health hindering our ability to act on the social/civil level.

This is important because when shortages arrive, social/civil collapse will happen long before unstoppable, irreversible runaway hothouse and mass extinction points are triggered.

It took 30 years for solar/wind power to reach 2% of total world energy use. Emissions went up 60% in those 30 years. Still we hype solar/wind/EV salvation and hope.

Here are just some of the drivers for premature collapse:
