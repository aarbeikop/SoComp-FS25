Then it kinda went away. Now its Global Warming. Same alarms, same threats, same everything it seems. Even NASA scientists  speculate these facts about it:

And then there are people who are going a step further and outright calling bullshit on the entire thing:

Now Im obviously not a scientist. Im not even a college grad in anything that matters when it comes to weather and such. I do know however, that people can make up a threat to attack an idea or a way of life to bring fear to people who allow their minds and hearts to be easily fooled. I clearly see this happening in various other subjects across the nation and the world abroad. 

No, I'm not saying climate change doesn't exist. Im not saying that It's going to end up destroying the world in a year either. I'm saying that when there is so much debate on something like this, where there are two very large sides debating it back and forth (especially when its about the fate of the planet and obviously us within it), I believe the truth is somewhere in between. Maybe climate change is real? Maybe its not nearly the threat people exagerate it for profit make it seem?

Just some thoughts I had I figured I'd share.","2015-05-24 05:06:02","0","6","0.45","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/372ba4/so_whatever_happened_to_global_cooling/","True","Fox436","1747898523.707662","climate alarmism","manual"
