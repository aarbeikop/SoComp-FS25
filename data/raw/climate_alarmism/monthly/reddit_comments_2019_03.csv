I think the IPCC is conservative myself, but no matter. The point is that even if we met by some miracle, 2 degrees of warming, we're still in for very big trouble. Last time the earth was 1 degree warmer than now, the ocean was 9 meters higher. I'm pretty sure that would be a problem, not to mention the effects on the natural world. At 3.5 we have wide spread effects resulting in more death and migration than would be economically sustainable, certainly enough to lose the aerosol masking effect.

"ehtofp8","t3_ax99g6","ax99g6","collapse","skeptical","People keep talking about how shocking the book is. I think maybe it's shocking to people who have done no research into this at all, or are completely new to the idea that our civilization isn't necessarily eternal. 

If you're not entirely new to the idea of collapse then the book is pretty unremarkable. It's okay. It's basically a long list of facts. Some are interesting. There's not much analysis of how exactly climate change will manifest in social collapse, which is what I was hoping for.

If you haven't considered that the society you grew up in might vanish in your lifetime then this book might be the wake-up call you need. But for subscribers here it's pretty tame.","2019-03-05 06:11:31","5","DowntownPomelo","1747949700.029036","climate alarmism","manual"
"ehs2z35","t3_ax99g6","ax99g6","collapse","skeptical","Wallace-Wells is an old-school catastrophist. They haven't been very effective at enacting real change. Not to say he is wrong exactly, but not effective, which is a way of being wrong. Bludgeoning the IPCC results into scary infotainment isn't really working. People tune out, reject it, forget it, focus on more uplifting things so they don't wake up and commit suicide. Look how many people leave this forum for those reasons. One can't function when this is all you hear, there is no hope when you can't function, it's a downward viral pit of despair and insanity. Looking into the void.

"ehvm7ao","t3_ax99g6","ax99g6","collapse","skeptical","To be fair the very article he cites for toxic oceans says itself that they don’t and won’t have the right conditions to go anoxic. 

Also “ancient superbugs” from the ice ravaging all of humanity is unlikely because just like all other diseases they have to travel.","2019-03-05 23:25:19","1","IndisputableKwa","1747949700.035539","climate alarmism","manual"
