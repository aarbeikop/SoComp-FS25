"eg53ffo","t3_aozoft","aozoft","climatechange","action-oriented","There are multiple issues with Shakhova's research that need to be addressed. First off, the study that people like to bring up is this one:

[https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2007](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2007)

What Shakhova(and company) did was go to the Eastern Siberian Sea in summer, took data from a ""hotspot"" and used said data to extrapolate year round methane emissions for the entire area. Thats a major red flag in and of itself.

Secondly, multiple research teams have gone up to Eastern Siberia and havent found anywhere near the level of methane emissions Shakhova and her team had found.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309656440\_Observations\_of\_atmospheric\_methane\_and\_its\_stable\_isotope\_ratio\_d13C\_over\_the\_Russian\_Arctic\_seas\_from\_ship\_cruises\_in\_the\_summer\_and\_autumn\_of\_2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309656440_Observations_of_atmospheric_methane_and_its_stable_isotope_ratio_d13C_over_the_Russian_Arctic_seas_from_ship_cruises_in_the_summer_and_autumn_of_2015)

Third, its not clear if the Eastern Siberian Sea even froze up during the last ice age or if there are even methane clathrates in it.

Forth, of the methane being released by the Eastern Siberian sea, we're not sure how much of it is even reaching the atmosphere. Whats more, its quite possible the Eastern Siberian sea has been naturally releasing methane for thousands of years.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, nobody has been able to replicate Shakhova's results. And at the end of the day, Shakhova makes broad assumptions about the nature of the Eastern Siberian Sea. I respect her as a scientist, but its clear her work has flaws and should be viewed with a grain of salt. Theres a reason her work is briefly mentioned yet not included in the IPCC.

"eg5jw9u","t3_aozoft","aozoft","climatechange","action-oriented","I agree. Unlimited self-promotion added to limited science. Much ado about 2 Tg/yr. Note that in their scientific papers they stopped talking about methane hydrates at ESAS, only in public discussions. All of my colleagues are skeptical about their methane conclusions (supersaturation results seem valid).    ","2019-02-10 13:36:36","6","yurganov44","1747948752.6198158","climate alarmism","manual"
"eg5oyux","t3_aozoft","aozoft","climatechange","action-oriented","Are methane feedbacks real? Yes for sure.

Will they affect our climate? Yes for sure.

How much? No one can say today. This is a fairly new discovery and there is much more science needed.

My personal opinion is this: If there is only the slightest chance, that the effects will be severe, we need to fucking act NOW nonetheless. It would be moronic to use the possibility that they aren't so severe as an excuse to dismiss climate change.","2019-02-10 15:10:06","2","[deleted]","1747948752.621482","climate alarmism","manual"

If our food supply is disrupted even two or three years of serious widespread famine is going to cause billions of deaths. Even assuming that we can get the methane to stop outgassing we can't simply go on a ten year diet as a species waiting for the next decent harvest.","2019-02-17 13:42:11","16","markodochartaigh1","1747949160.4198668","climate alarmism","manual"
