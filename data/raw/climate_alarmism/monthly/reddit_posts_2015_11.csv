Coal Mafia In China And India Doesn't Report Emissions.

Can't See The Food For The Trees

The U.S. only has about 10% of the forest they started with 400 years ago. Humans now destroy 20 million acres of forest every year. We already slashed and burned 50% of the rainforests on earth. Most of the destruction has been in the last 50 years.  

Rainforest soil is of poor quality and quantity so farming it only degrades it even faster. Rainforest roots are so dense, they don't require robust and plentiful soils. So, planting mono-cultures, such as soy or palm oil, in these thin, weak soils only erodes them quicker. Trees are living batteries of energy essential for the propagation of the bio-diversity of life on earth. We are draining the battery for all life on earth for foods like palm oil. The same palm oil Germans burn in their diesel cars. Indonesia will destroy 98% of its rainforests by 2025.

In 2007, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2015 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

In 2014, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2030 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

The IPCC says we can make this change because of what they call ""negative-emissions bio-energy"". meaning we will get energy by consuming plant matter in a way that pulls more CO2 out of the air than it emits; for which, by the way, no such technology exists, and the kicker is, they say, that we will need 1.5 billion acres of NEW farmland to do it. That much farmland is about the size of India, which is equal to nearly 50% of all the arable land on earth. 

The acronym for this fantasy is BECCS (Bio-Energy Carbon Capture & Storage). The real acronym is BS (Bull Shit). Where do you think we'll find all this new farmland? The rainforests. World hunger will guarantee it. Why? Read on.

In 60 years, human agriculture will ground to a stop because of soil loss and degradation. 20% of China's soil and 50% of its groundwater is already unsafe. We are right now already slashing and burning Brazil's rainforests just to feed China's pigs. China's pigs already eat 50% of the soy grown in South America. The Chinese are buying up farmland all over the earth.

Because we add 1 MILLION PEOPLE TO EARTH EVERY 5 DAYS (each who would very much like to eat every day for at least 50 years), we will have to grow more food over the these next 50 years than we grew in all of the last 10,000 years, combined. This is called math, get used to it, it will rule your life. We already converted nearly half the earth's surface into cities and farmland. Do you seriously believe 9 billion people will stop eating meat and wasting food?

To feed nine billion people all at once for all their lives means we will need 12 million acres of brand new farmland EVERY year for 30 years. Instead, we are losing 24 million acres of farmland EVERY year. We are losing soil at twice the rate we need to grow it just to be able to eat, never mind the additional requirements of BECCS.

Drought is spreading across the earth. Try growing food for 9 billion people without water and soil. We kill elephants and orangutans before slashing and burning Indonesia's remaining rainforests just to grow palm oil that is burned in Northern Europe's German cars. 50% of Europe's ""Renewable Energy"" comes from burning wood imported from all over the world. We call this the ""Green Economy"" on account of how green people are behind the ears when it comes to their e-CON-omy.

In 25 years we will pass peak energy and minerals.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378011001361

This will happen when all our new solar panels and wind mills stop working and become expensive junk we can't afford to replace or recycle in times of shortages in water, food, energy, minerals and civility. Recycling their component alloys costs more and uses more energy than mining for them does. Each time a mineral is recycled it loses its quality and usefulness.

Over the next 50 years energy demand will double (at the same time we have to reduce emissions at least 50%) because over 2 billion rural refugees will move to cities, and 75% of the infrastructure they require does not even exist yet.  Concrete production is a super-emitter of carbon into the air. 

Yet, it also takes 10 times the amount of rated renewable energy to close one equally rated fossil fuel plant simply because renewable energy is intermittent and fossil energy is not. It will be a physical impossibility to meet all future demand with 100% renewable energy and reduce emissions all at the same time. Half the renewable power in Europe comes from burning imported wood from all over the world. Rainforests are slashed and burned in South America and Indonesia to grow soy and palm oils that are exported Europe to burn in German cars.
