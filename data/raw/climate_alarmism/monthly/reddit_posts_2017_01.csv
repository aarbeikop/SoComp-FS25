... to a conversation on **renewable energy** which would lead to a **better future**.

Think of what most climate change conversations have become in the past few years: a discussion of greenhouse gasses, the validity of science, economic profits, and the inevitable blame game. This is what the majority of people see in the media, even in relatively good sources. When they search for answers, they can rarely find them in these discussions. 

It is important to educate oneself on different points of view, but there is only one reasonable point of view: future safety. This is NOT alarmism. This is not my proclamation of a liberal agenda. This is not an ideological debate (OK, maybe a little, but what good debate isn't). This is not even a debate on religion, although many people will attempt to make it into one. If you want to have these debates, fine, but realize that it will likely be a waste of time. If people wanted to know the truth about climate change, they likely would already, or could easily learn by themselves (it’s called Google).

The most promising solution to climate change is the use of renewable energies. We know that forward momentum in renewable energy is happening, but we cannot be sure it is at a rate which is safe. I ask you, do you and your children want to continue to live in an unsafe world? 

“But change is happening fast… the world will take care of itself!” Yes, yes it is! But the distractions of these inane and idiotic conversations mince the point - change is not happening fast enough. We must STRIVE, not just accept our fate and leave it to our fabulous engineers, wonderful marketing teams, or burdened politicians. 

**Awareness and loudness go a long way, so do your part and be LOUD, and make the right point. There are many ways to success, but let’s be honest: taking on the biggest problem is the most difficult, but that also makes it the most fun.**
