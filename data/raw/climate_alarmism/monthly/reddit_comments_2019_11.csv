It seems that climate crisis does a better job of highlighting just how urgent the problem is, and how much immediate action is needed if we are to have any hope of stopping the problem. I have been particularly impressed by the group of protestors I learned about in Melbourne, Australia, for their global hunger strike, as it involves young people sacrificing as well to draw attention to their cause.

In 2018 global CO2 emissions where the highest on record! How could that not be a crisis? And if this is news to you, how is that possible? What forces are at work to change the perception of an approaching irreversible catastrophe of Gigabiblical proportions into a just ""change"".

Preoccupied with the resulting political chaos, the Human System becomes even more vulnerable and incapable of ameliorating ESD. As ESD thus accelerates, it generates more HSD.

"f8kckkf","t3_e0xv2q","e0xv2q","collapse","skeptical",">According to Dr. Wolfgang Knorr, Principal Investigator at Lund University’s Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in a Changing Climate Program, the risk of near-term collapse should be taken far more seriously by climate scientists, given the fact that so much is unknown about climate tipping points:

>>I am not saying that Bendell is right or wrong. But the criticism of Bendell’s points focuses too much on the detail and in that way studiously tries to avoid the bigger picture. The available data points to the fact that some catastrophic climate change is inevitable.

>Climate models we've been using are not ~~too alarmist~~ *conservative*;¹ they are consistently too ~~conservative~~ *optimistic*, and we have only recently understood how bad the situation really is.

1 'Conservative' in the context of estimates means 'tending to be cautious' which, in turn, means 'careful to avoid dangers'. We must not make the mistake of [perverting](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ckmflw/perversion_of_caution_in_the_scientific_community/) the concept of caution by replacing caution against danger, which is of utmost importance, with caution against discredit, which is trivial and vain. Moreover, given that 'alarmist' means 'someone who exaggerates a danger and so causes needless worry or panic', nobody should engage in alarmism. At the same time it is a mistake to employ 'alarmist', 'alarmism' when one indends to refer to 'realist', 'realism', 'cautious', 'caution' or 'conservative', as those who do so bring themselves as well as everyone else by their side into disrepute.

Make it millions of years, at the bare minimum.

>[D]iminishing returns from complexity were not the main driver of a [societal] system’s decline; rather the decline in complexity of the [societal] system is due to diminishing returns from exploiting natural resources.

>In other words, collapse is a result of a form of endless growth premised on the unsustainable consumption of resources

>So as alarming as the mounting evidence of the risk of collapse is, it also indicates that we are moving into a genuinely new and indeterminate phase in the life cycle of our current civilization, during which we have a radical opportunity to mobilize the spread of new ideas that can transform societies.

Nice joke.
