But remember CA is in the midst of the worst drought ever yet it's economy has not missed a beat. People are quite good at adapting so far.

It is always good to have a emergency food and water supplies, but if climate change is your worry, what you need is adaptation. 

The first priority is to make sure that you and your neighbors (whether you live in the NYC or in a ranch of South Dakota )  have a steady water supply. If your community depends on glacier or snow melt for water, that is not enough. Those are disappearing for the foreseeable future.  
If your community depends on rain water, storage will need to be expanded as it will rain harder but less often. Floods will be more epic than what we have seen this year. That is a threat to watch out for.

Food is tricky. Even if all of California's crops were to fail because of drought, we would still have stores of wheat and corn from the east. So I like to think that even under the very worst case scenarios, we would be able to distribute grains to most communities with good governance.

Personally I'm trying to grow my own veggies and fruits (it is more complicated than it looks) To reduce my carbon print at the same time ensure some calories that might eventually be hard to find for my family.

I would only consider relocating if you live lower than 6 feet of sea level. Another option is to convince your community to plan and build dikes like the people of Netherland have done for centuries. 

Make sure you have a plan to protect yourself from heatwaves. AC works only on moderate heatwaves and only while the power is on. If you have enough money, get some solar panels and batteries that can run a good AC for a while.
