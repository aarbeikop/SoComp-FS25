A letter to my parents (and many other parents of millennial children)

Throughout the world, the alarm bells that have been ringing for well over a decade now are finally starting to be heard. Freak weather events, record breaking heatwaves and highest temperatures year after year, distinct absences of frosty mornings in the winter, periods of drought and then weeks of heavy rain. Angry young people are telling politicians to sit down, shut up and listen, taking to the street with placards essentially begging for a shot at their future, before its robbed from us and generations to come. 

I don’t know how to persuade the complacent older generation who convivially laugh about how they’ll be dead before it’s a real problem for them - but Mum, Dad, I won’t be. I will be very much alive and so will (god willing) your grandchildren. You raised me to be successful, the scientist that I am. I have had the benefit of higher education that you have not so perhaps I have had the (mis)fortune of having these issues thrust in my face to analyse, to critique, to evidence and find solutions for. I can assure you now that you will not be dead before it’s an issue, because it’s an issue now. At the predicted pinnacle of all this climate chaos, in 2100, your grandchildren will be alive and fighting to stay cool, fighting for clean drinking water and adequate food, fighting for space and resources with millions of climate refugees who will be leaving equatorial areas in the next few decades. I do not want to hear that it is not your problem any more, because I am your daughter and it is my problem, and therefore yours.

Do you know that I am considering not having children at all? Since my late teens I dreamed of having a family, having children and raising them to be good and kind. But raising my children right may be the least of my concerns if I must arm them with the skills and wherewithal to cope with a planet that is slowly dying. You can have them during school holidays and feed them ice cream and take them to nice places, but when you hand them back to me, I must ensure that their future is secure for them seeing as ‘you’ll be dead’, so who cares. I must ensure that when I die, they are savvy enough to cope, they are tenacious enough to fight for resources. What if I must raise my children to live selfishly to ensure their survival? What if I everything I endeavour to preach, to be kind, to be generous, I have to double back on and preach instead to be cut-throat and vicious? I am not sure I can truly justify bringing new lives into this planet to condemn them to a life of suffering and fighting.

You may think me over dramatic but remember how proud you were when I graduated with my first degree and then my Masters. I have armed myself with analytical skills, I have privileged access to reams of scientific evidence that supports that modern climate change is perpetuated by human activity. Despite there being accessible evidence for the general public freely available, I know you won’t look for it or read it or take it seriously. But believe *me*. Trust *me*. Trust that I am not making this up, I am not being over-dramatic. Believe that I am scared and that you should be too. For my sake and the sake of your grandchildren. 

I would imagine from my (fortunately) limited understanding that coming to realise what trouble the planet is really in is like being diagnosed with cancer. Sat across from a professional who knows better than you, who is trained in these things and highly qualified, telling you that, potentially, you’re absolutely fucked. But. If you start treatment and you start it NOW, there is a chance that you can kick its ass after a bit of time, though you won’t be the same after. Your family won’t be the same. You will go forward in life from now on carefully considering your diet, your level of activity, the products you put on your body and clean your home with. I can imagine that it’s a shock to the system, to look at your life and realise the magnitude of change you must undertake. Knowing that it isn’t just down to you, it’s down to everyone. Your colleagues, your neighbours, your family, your friends, the server who brought you your food, the men who collect your rubbish, the newsreaders on the TV, that comedian you laugh at. What are they doing? What’s the point if they’re not doing a thing either? They’re ignoring this cancer - surely it’ll go away if we just change to energy-saving light bulbs and make sure the tap isn’t running while we brush our teeth... 

I guarantee you if you start making a change tomorrow, someone will see that and think – shit. If you’re doing something, maybe I should too. Maybe this is serious. After all, your daughter is a scientist, she’d know. And Mum, Dad, you should know. This isn’t a secret. This isn’t new. This is real. You might both be sun worshippers and be enjoying this ‘global warming lark’, but it isn’t to be laughed at. It is time to sit down, shut up and listen.","2019-07-02 10:47:08","14","6","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/c87ri2/a_letter_to_my_parents/","True","concerned_overlywarm","1747951529.8632078","climate alarmism","manual"

Climate change is a defining issue of our time, especially for young people who are persuaded that we are doomed unless urgent action is taken on carbon emissions. Activists, with some success, are demanding climate emergencies be declared around the world, making those demands on the basis that temperatures are at record highs, glaciers and sea ice are melting at unprecedented rates, and sea levels rising dangerously.

A cursory examination of the geological literature shows that the first two assertions are simply not true, and that rising sea levels are par for the course.

To assert that today’s temperatures are record highs is mischief-making of the highest order. Earth has been much hotter (up to 10C hotter) for the vast majority of geological time. Jurassic Park was very hot, and when the dinosaurs suddenly died out 65 million years ago, the succeeding age of mammals was similarly very hot. The last million years (a mere heartbeat on the geological time-scale) has been atypically cold, with extraordinarily large fluctuations in temperature. This period can be described as a series of 100,000-year-long cycles of dangerously cold ice ages (10C colder than today) and warm interglacials (where we are now). The inter­glacials are relatively short, usually a few thousand years, and we are already 12,000 years or so into this one. The record would suggest we might soon descend into another dangerously cold glaciation.

Geologists know temperatures were higher than they are today during the Holocene maximum, 5000 to 9000 years ago in our current interglacial, and higher (by at least 2 C) in two of the last three interglacial periods. Sea levels are rising, but just 12,000 years ago, at the end of the last glaciation, sea levels were as much as 140m lower than today, and they then rose dramatically as we entered this interglacial. Sea levels were significantly higher than today just a very short time ago.

Sea levels were also significantly higher in the last interglacial 125,000 years ago; Florida Keys, for example, is the remains of a coral reef that grew then.

The really major ice melt was during the transition from the last glaciation to today. Canada was covered entirely by a massive sheet of ice with no vegetation and New Zealand’s South Island lakes were 1km-thick glaciers — so today’s reductions in sea ice and glacier volumes are quite trivial.

This is proved by the modern-day retreat of glaciers which is ­exhuming the remains of forests that existed just a few thousand years ago in Alaska and Europe.

Alarmists assert that despite all that, CO2 is a greenhouse gas and we are pumping large quantities of it into the atmosphere, causing catastrophic warming. But the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does not know how potent CO2 is as a greenhouse gas, and gives a possible range for climate sensitivity of one to six. If climate sensitivity is low (close to one) then our emissions will never dangerously warm Earth. Climate sensitivity due to CO2 alone is actually just one, but climate scientists add all sorts of uncertain feedback effects to make it higher.

Milankovitch Cycles are the favoured explanation for the recent cycles of ice ages and interglacial periods, thus making the sun the main driver of temperature change. But other factors are certainly involved, because climate is an incredibly complex system, and on the geological time scale, processes such as plate tectonics, volcanism and impacts from extraterrestrial bodies play significant roles.

Let us agree that the sun drove the 10C ups and downs in temperature between glaciations and interglacials, and let us acknowledge that the modern satellite record of temperatures shows global temperatures regularly going up and down by as much as 1C on a timescale of three to 10 years (probably due to oceanic influences such as El Nino). We know, too, that temperatures over the past 9000 years have varied up and down by almost 2C. Not one of those changes can be blamed on our carbon emissions. In the context of these natural changes, why is the small warming of about 1C in the 20th century regarded as extraordinary and alarming?

The IPCC stated quite clearly that: “In climate research and modelling, we should recognise that we are dealing with a coupled nonlinear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” Why is it then that people believe the so-called IPCC projections of future climate change to be valid, when even the IPCC says it can’t make valid predictions?

It is an indictment of our education system that students are convinced today’s climate change is extraordinary when it falls well within the bounds of natural climate change. They should be told, too, that we do not know how potent CO2 is as a greenhouse gas.

All this is not to say that there is nothing to be alarmed about. Humans have changed and often overwhelmed the environment (most living things try to do exactly the same, but are restrained by some form of dynamic equilibrium). If we want our civilisation to survive, it is imperative that we manage finite resources (including fossil fuels) more carefully.

Most politicians talk in terms of a few years’ time, or of caring for our children’s or grandchildren’s generation, but I’d prefer to think we can stay around a little longer than that. Human civilisation as we know it has been around perhaps 10,000 years, so let’s start by making sure we can survive for at least another 10,000 years. And why not a million years or more?

Which means we must stop polluting the oceans, stop overfishing, find more sustainable sources of electricity and control population growth. Given the present reality that large nations such as China dominate global emissions and are increasing them, nations such as Australia and New Zealand need not panic over the use of fossil fuels. Nuclear energy may be a short-term option for Australia, but surviving for another million years will certainly require new solutions and technology.

I suggest to the activists that the clarion call for action should be “managing the environment and sustainability”, not “stopping climate change”.

The very idea that we can stop climate change is barking mad. Climate change is inevitable, as geology has always shown.

"c802l1","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2019 q2","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for three and a half year now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.
