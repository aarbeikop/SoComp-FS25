https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/09/like-nothing-weve-seen-queensland-bushfires-tear-through-rainforest

It’s  not even summer yet and our rainforests are on fire. And our largest river system is pretty much destroyed  with more mass fish die offs expected and other species in danger of collapse. 
 
Bushfires:
“Queensland’s former fire commissioner says an erratic bushfire front that climbed into the state’s subtropical rainforest and razed the 86-year-old Binna Burra Lodge is “like nothing we’ve ever seen before”.

“What we’re seeing, it’s just not within people’s imagination,” said Lee Johnson, who spent 12 years in charge of Queensland’s fire service.

“They just didn’t believe it could ever get so bad.”

River System:
“Researchers have warned of other alarming ecological signs that the Lower Darling River – part of the giant Murray-Darling Basin – is in a dire state, following last summer’s mass fish kills.

Professor Fran Sheldon, from Griffith University’s Australian Rivers Institute, said only one surviving colony of river mussels had been found along the river and there were signs that river red gums were under severe stress.

“If the river red gums die, and some are hundreds of years old, there will be a domino effect. Banks will collapse, there will be massive erosion and it will send sediments down the river.”

“These sort of ecological collapses are much harder and expensive to reverse,” she warned.

Yet Australians keep voting in climate change denying,  environmentally destructive, only govern to make more money for the rich conservative governments.

We’re so fucked it’s beyond fucked.

A tipping point is where a process cannot be stopped or reversed once initiated, like the the squeezing of the trigger of a gun. We face a nexus of 3 major tipping points.

1. Runaway Hothouse Earth

2. Runaway Ocean Acidification

3. Runaway Mass Extinction

Once any of these 3 tipping points are triggered, then that event becomes unstoppable and irreversible. We are already deep into mass extinction, and there's nothing we can do to stop it, period. The very best we can even hope to do is to slow it down.

Did you ever see a scientist go out on a limb? Of course not, if he did, there would be 3 other scientists cutting that limb to take him out.  Scientists are trained to be reticent about alarmism, and are no different than media personalities -- if they don't tow the line, their ass is grass. But being alarmist is essential now. The time for cowardice is gone.

The only thing that can destroy this planet faster than us is an asteroid about the size of Greenland, or multiple hydrogen bombs. Did you know cement use tripled in the last 20 years, and it's set to double again by 2050? Did you know 4 billion flights are had each year, and we expect 8 billion flights per year by 2050? Did you know that we have to cut emissions 50% in 10 years to avoid runaway hothouse climate chaos? 

Drought, starvation, war, famine and mass poisoning are spearheading these 3 major tipping points, and each are bad enough, in of themselves. They act like the thin edge of the wedge that forms the sharp point that pricks the balloon of life on earth. I imagine the recovery of phyto- and zoo- planktons will likely take several millions of years.

**The world is deep into the sixth mass extinction event, and may be “too late” to change.**

https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1169480/end-world-mass-extinction-event-climate-change-doomsday-asteroid-spt

- At least a million species are now in serious decline or facing extinction. 

**The next mass extinction event is already underway**

- Population sizes of vertebrate species have, on average, dropped by more than half in 40 years,"" while human population has nearly doubled from about four billion to 7.3 billion.

**Plants are going extinct up to 350 times faster than the historical norm**

https://qz.com/africa/1694276/plants-are-going-extinct-350-times-faster-than-normal/

- If we were to condense the Earth’s 4.5-billion-year-old history into one calendar year, then life evolved somewhere in June, dinosaurs appeared somewhere around Christmas, and the Anthropocene starts within the last millisecond of New Year’s Eve. Modern plant extinction rates that exceed historical rates by hundreds of times over such a brief period will spell disaster for our planet’s future.

**Climate change is killing off Earth’s little creatures**

https://theconversation.com/climate-change-is-killing-off-earths-little-creatures-109719

- 40% of insect species are declining and a 33% are endangered.

**Oceans may be at the 'precipice of excitation,' due to carbon in the oceans, which would unleash a mass extinction of life**

https://therealnews.com/stories/study-breaching-carbon-threshold-could-trigger-mass-extinction-in-oceans

- It can’t be stressed enough, that after the threshold is reached, what happens is that there is a runaway process that’s initiated. But it plays out at a 10,000-year timescale. 

**Giant river animals on verge of extinction**

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/10/giant-river-animals-on-verge-of-extinction-report-warns

- Populations of great freshwater species, from catfish to stingrays, have plunged by 97% since 1970

- About 100 million sharks are estimated to be killed each year for their fins and meat.","2019-09-02 13:45:11","215","55","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cyp5jm/we_are_already_deep_into_the_6ᵗʰ_mass_extinction/","True","CommonEmployment","1747952885.021421","climate alarmism","manual"
