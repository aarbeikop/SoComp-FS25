"4jbigy","collapse","skeptical","Is Alex Jones evil, insane or simply bought and paid for?","I think this is something that's worth addressing. Here's a guy, who attracts millions of the world's angriest most disenfranchised people, then goes on to feed them complete hogwash. If you have a show dedicated to addressing nefarious conspiracies by people plotting against our best interest, [surely you would be interested in the fact that oil companies researched the climate change caused by fossil fuels, only to use their advance knowledge to wage a war of disinformation against anyone who tries to ring the alarm bells?](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968) This is the most pure and unadulterated form of evil imaginable, of people willing to destroy the whole planet just to protect their own individual greed. But he won't touch it.

Now, it's one thing to be wrong. You'd imagine that watching the Australian Great Barrier Reef die, massive droughts threatening famines throughout Africa and a stunning global temperature explosion to knew heights, would make a man consider that he might have been wrong and change his opinion, or at least shut up about it. But that's not what happens. 

[Here's Alex Jones from a few days ago, hosting a show with Lord Monckton, ""The Day The Climate Change Myth Died"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGSZLodVkIY) Instead of acknowledging the open conspiracy of entrenched corporate greed by people who have no higher calling in life than to enrich themselves and buy private yets and yachts, the narrative is rearranged, to portray a hypothetical conspiracy where global warming is used as a myth to implement some sort of global tyranny, for no clear reason other than some people's apparent desire to have global tyranny for its own sake.

[Go back a few years, and we find Alex Jones and his cronies peddling the idea that peak oil is a myth.](http://www.prisonplanet.com/archives/peak_oil/index.htm) Why is peak oil a myth? Because supposedly there are mysterious deep geological reserves from which oil flows upwards, allowing you to permanently retrieve more oil from the same wells. This bullshit was peddled exactly at a time when oil prices were going through the roof. 

[Of course these are the same people who claim that 90+% of the world's population is going to be eradicated with weaponized ebola.](http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/april2006/040406_b_depopulation.htm) Their evidence is mostly based on a herpetologist in Texas who's worried that overpopulation threatens an ecological catastrophe. But apparently, this secret plot to eradicate most of the world's population [no longer deserves precedence over funny videos of angry feminist college students.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFrZsGbO6N0)

So what's going on here? To reiterate, we have a guy here, who spews disinformation on three problems that are going to define our lives in the 21st century: Overpopulation, fossil fuel depletion and climate change. Note that he doesn't express ""skepticism"", he spews an internally consistent anti-narrative, in which every real problem we face is in fact a hoax, created by evil powerful men lurking behind the scenes who wish to gain more control over us. How exactly does this happen?

It's possible that Alex Jones is just stupid and/or mentally ill, leading him to believe in his own hallucinations. It's also possible that Alex Jones is evil and knows what he's doing. He creates a unified conspiratorial narrative that intuitively appeals to people, as it portrays a group of evil powerful men that meet in secret at the Bilderberg group, who ultimately wish to eradicate the majority of the human population, with only himself and his cronies as people actively dedicated to addressing this problem. Because nobody else competes in this economic niche, it ensures that he keeps sufficient fans/cash crops to afford a wealthy lifestyle. It also has the side effect of ensuring that all their anger and energy and up misdirected, cast at faces in the clouds.

Alternatively, it's attractive to consider the possibility that Alex Jones receives money from the oil industry in one form or another. He creates a counternarrative that they could never overtly associate themselves with, but appeals to a naturally anti-authoritarian demographic for whom the general propaganda (global warming is exaggerated/not caused by humans/there's still enough oil out there) doesn't really work. Any thoughts? What explains this phenomenon?

"4ka6of","collapse","skeptical","Anyone else noticing longer-lasting colds/flus?","I apologize if this isn't directly collapse-related, but I figured this might be a good place to ask.

I've experienced, witnessed, and heard of colds/flus lasting a lot longer than normal this Spring. I don't get sick often, but I and others (who also rarely get sick) have experienced a long-lasting cold/flu (weeks instead of days) recently. It seems a little bit concerning, not necessarily alarming, but an observation that's been echoed by my own doctor.

My initial instinct is to attribute this to record global heat and a [mild winter](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/01/29/1510991/climate-change-and-the-flu-warm-winters-followed-by-severe-flu-seasons/) (though this study predicts that the following winter will see worse flu seasons, not the Spring immediately following), but I can't be sure.
