"cqtwxso","t3_34e6xg","34e6xg","climatechange","action-oriented","The earth has fluctuated in carbon levels ever since the Cambrian. In a purely illustartive sense, it inhales oxygen and exhales CO2. We are coming out of an ice age (pleistocene glaciation) and global ice concentration is obviously decreasing. It seems to me that the earth was already bound to heat up, but humans greatly accelerated the process. Also, cow farts increase methane levels significantlt, but their existence is due to human farming so humans are technically behind that as well. I need to do more research on volcanic activity, but that could accelerate greenhouse effects on a scale that would make fossil fuel burning and cow farts miniscule in comparison.

"cqtyfpx","t3_34e6xg","34e6xg","climatechange","action-oriented","It sounds like what you are describing in your first two sentences are [Milenkovitch Cycles](http://www.indiana.edu/~geol105/images/gaia_chapter_4/milankovitch.htm).  It is generally accepted that these cycles are what's responsible for the shift back and forth over the last several hundred thousand years from glacial periods to interglacials (like the one we are in now).  

As you point out, the warming during the 20th century was about 1.4°F or about 0.8°C.  There was a warming trend prior to the 1940s, then a slight cooling trend, then a warming trend from about 1970 to 2000.  There are debates over the causes of the two warming trends.  Most scientists attribute the majority of first warming period to natural causes, especially an increase in solar activity.  The IPCC in particular has stated that most (i.e., at least 50%) of the warming during the second period is due to mankind.  There are climate scientists who dispute that attribution, but nearly all climate scientists attribute at least some of the warming to mankind.

You are incorrect to state that CO2 concentrations have been increasing over the last 2 million years.  During the present ice age (yes, we are in an ice age), CO2 concentration dropped significantly, especially during glacial periods.  It was so low at certain times that plants were barely able to survive.  The present CO2 concentration of ~400 ppm is higher than during previous interglacials, but much lower than the earth experienced in the past.

Here's my take on the questions you ask in your final paragraph: ""climate change"" is a really poor term to describe what people want to talk about in recent history because the climate has always changed and always will.  When we talk about recent warming (last 100-200 years), there is a tendency among the uninformed to claim it is 100% natural or 100% manmade.  Both positions are false.  Mankind has had at least some impact, but natural variation has also played a role.  How much is due to each is surprisingly difficult to estimate.","2015-04-30 16:06:51","4","Will_Power","1747897013.652139","climate alarmism","manual"
"cqu7tel","t3_34e6xg","34e6xg","climatechange","action-oriented","In my opinion it is sometimes difficult to find the truth on this subject because different scientists will give you different data depending on who pays those scientists...

So for me it does not matter anymore if humans are the cause or not.  It is clear that humans produce a lot of CO2 in addition to natural CO2 emission, that additional CO2 may or may not cause temperature rise.

What is clear to me is that Greenland and Antarctica are melting and that water has to go somewhere, so we will see major flooding of coastal areas, my guess is within the next 100 years or so...

I tend to trust NASA scientists more because they have awesome lasers they use to measure the thickness of the ice in Antarctica ;), so my advice is do not buy any property near the coast ;)
