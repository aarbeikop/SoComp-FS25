Few of us have the power to change the world, and those who do don't typically seem to bother. All that we can do is choose how to spend the time that we've been given. Your personal choices will not impact the ultimate fate of the earth or humanity. But they will impact those around you. People/animals that you love, that depend on you, whose lives you can enrich by existing and being you. They're not going away, they're here now.

Don't feel obligated to take part in the rat race to infinity that we've all been conned into. Don't save for retirement, don't get a degree, don't go for a career - all fair. And don't have kids. But while you're still here, the way you choose to spend your time is just as valuable whether we live in the end days of human civilization or not, because each of us affects those around us.

"e4s6spt","t3_9a0msq","9a0msq","climatechange","action-oriented","I know you don't want to be told ""it's not going to be that bad"", but I'm going to do that right now, and I believe I have the science correct. 

Worst-case scenario, we are not looking at a future where everywhere becomes an uninhabitable desert wasteland.  Desertification will certainly ramp up, and earth's desert belt will grow in size, and populations in those marginal regions will suffer (and die), but the deserts will not take over the earth as depicted in mad-max. 

Some background:  The earth tends to cycle through two states, ice-ages and hot-house ages. These ages tend to last a few million years each. An ice-age is composed of two parts, glaciation periods where large portions of the earth are covered in glaciers, and interglacial period, where glaciers retreat to the poles. These glaciation/interglacials periods last about 100,000 years each. We are currently in an ice-age, which is called the ""Quaternary ice-age"", and are at the very start of an interglacial period (most of the ice is at the poles) within that ice-age called the Holocene.  Earth, over the past 500 million years, has spend about 80% of it's time as a hot-house earth and 20% of it's time in an ice-age. 

Back to anthropogenic climate change. Worst case scenario, we are looking at the end of the Quaternary ice-age and a return to ""hot house earth"". This will be catastrophic for many existing ecosystems which evolved in the current Quaternary ice-age, but it won't be catastrophic for life on earth as a whole, which has happily survived in a hot-house earth 80% of the time since the evolution of multicellular life. 

Now, onto humans.  We can expect current ecosystems, which evolved in an ice-age, to be severely disrupted by a radical shift back to a hot-house earth. This presents an existential threat to human civilization as we currently know it, but I would argue not to the survival of the human species.   Humans are incredibly adaptive, and are able to survive in incredible circumstances. We have human cultures in both the arctic where you can die from exposure from the cold, and the Sahara where you can die from exposure from the sun.  We have human cultures that live almost entirely on the ocean, and cultures that live in the deep rainforest. Humans can eat mammals, bugs, tubers, berries, grains, leaves, seeds, reptiles, and fish (among many other things).  We are the most adaptable species that has ever existed, we will be fine in terms of pure survival of the species. 

However, human civilization might be screwed.   We likely can't support 10 billion humans in a rapidly changing climate, and will most likely see a major population crash (along with an associated civilizational crash).  But the civilization does not make the species, and as long as we avoid massive use of nuclear weapons, the human species will soldier on (with a much smaller population minus global civilization).

Could you provide some peer reviewed literature to support these claims? You should try not to get information about climate change from news media, because they can't accurately represent the vast majority of climate scientists and will often have a bias, whether that be towards denialism or alarmism. Try and get as much information as you can directly from scientific sources.

I'm also sceptical of your dismissal of technology in the fight against climate change. Humans have gone to the moon, defeated diseases, and harnessed the atom to unleash untold power. Are you seriously going to bet against humans being able to effectively harness the climate within the next few centuries? We already have rudimentary geoengineering techniques; we just need a better understanding of the knock-on effects they will have. 

You should also go to a doctor and ask about depression. You're exhibiting some key signs (lack of motivation, depressed outlook, etc.), and it's really not a good idea to try and live your life with untreated depression. I've tried it and it's not fun.

I hope you get a better outlook on life soon.","2018-08-24 23:25:00","6","[deleted]","1747945463.992044","climate alarmism","manual"
"e4rwd1y","t3_9a0msq","9a0msq","climatechange","action-oriented","First off, you seem to be clinically depressed. Morbidity and a lack of interest in previous ambitions are warning signs. Depression is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in university students. I'm going to assume here that your statement ""We are literally living through the last few generations of the entire human species"" was inspired by one or more of your professors. You are not alone. When I went to university there were toxic people teaching in most departments. 

Consider that all of the problems that you see around you are not caused at all by climate, but by other factors. Notably, overpopulation, pollution, and greed. You mentioned that we're a short-sighted lot. Human greed is very short-sighted. One traps a monkey by placing bait in a jar with a small opening. the monkey reaches in, grasps the bait, and is trapped because it can't remove it's hand. It never occurs to the monkey to release the bait because of it's greed. Humans are no different. 

What I recommend is something I wish someone would have told me in my school days - don't take anyone's word for anything. Sure, regurgitate whatever trash the professor requires for grading, but keep in mind that every professor designs his course based on his pwn beliefs and prejudices. Which means that they have agendas which they push on their students. 

I hope this helps and I very much hope that I haven't assumed more than is fair considering what you wrote.

That said, what is important to you at 21 is not what will be important to you at 35. Knowing what’s happening to the world at large and knowing what your own future holds are two different things. There may very well be brilliant and exciting and worthwhile experiences in your future, but the only way you will experience them is by being ready for them. That is why you learn (in school or not), why you take care of your mind and body. You never know when something, anything, can provide meaning in your life, so don’t give up.

"e4s6jni","t3_9a0msq","9a0msq","climatechange","action-oriented","I really get where you're coming from. We have no idea what's coming, with the temps and the plastics in the water and the loss of biodiversity, massive disaster events, and air pollution. Sometimes I feel the same way. I can't really talk about it with many people either, as my therapist obviously is only considered with addressing childhood trauma, and my friends feel the same hopelessness (because we're all twenty-somethings that aren't actively working in a field that deals with climate change).

The only thing that keeps me going is hope (that last of the gifts from pandora's box). I keep my recycling quality as high as I can, I eat very little animal meat, sometimes I ride my bike or take the bus. It's not enough, I know. So many people refuse to see that growth is possible. My current congressmen have no interest in addressing climate change. I can only be one drop in the storm.

I hope, though. The more we talk about it, the more we can hope to create a flood. I have hope that the future will at least be survivable. I don't know where this hope comes from, and I don't know how to give it to you. Whatever you need to tell yourself to keep fighting is good enough. We need you, and everyone one of us, to keep fighting for the animals and the plants and the planet we live on. We don't know what's going to happen; we can only guess. We can guess the worst, or we can hope for the best (or at least the not-worst). And we can work. We can be different.

If you find these things laughable or irrelevant, then I don't know what else to say. The solution has to start from inside; the attitude has to open to the idea of the not-worst in order to believe in our ability to make a change.

 If you're interested, I recommend the podcast Alice Isn't Dead (from the creators of Welcome to Nightvale). They're finishing up the last season soon, and it's coming to a head quickly.

One, there is inherent uncertainty in the modelling that projects climatic changes and also the impacts on ecosystems and human systems are difficult to quantify. We are certainly in over out heads. Going forward in the dark if you will. But still, the fact that there are so many unknowns means we can't rule out some kind of success.

In terms of the myriad of comments on depression, I am wary of such diagnoses online from one single interaction, but there is a strong link between knowledge on climate change and depression, for I think you must find obvious reasons. My personal recommendation is probably similar to others you've heard, but I stand by them. 1) seek out success stories related to solving the issue. 2) take up action yourself to tackle the issue. Taking some agency over the problem may provide a sense of control as well as learning more of those success stories.
