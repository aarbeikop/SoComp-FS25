34tcge,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: I am John Cook, Climate Change Denial researcher, Climate Communication Fellow for the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, and creator of SkepticalScience.com. Ask Me Anything!","Hi r/science,
I study Climate Change Science and the psychology surrounding it. I co-authored the college textbook Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis, and the book Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand. I've published papers on scientific consensus, misinformation, agnotology-based learning and the psychology of climate change. I'm currently completing a doctorate in cognitive psychology, researching the psychology of consensus and the efficacy of inoculation against misinformation.

I co-authored the 2011 book Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand with Haydn Washington, and the 2013 college textbook Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis with Tom Farmer. I also lead-authored the paper Quantifying the Consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature, which was tweeted by President Obama and was awarded the best paper published in Environmental Research Letters in 2013. In 2014, I won an award for Best Australian Science Writing, published by the University of New South Wales.

I am currently completing a PhD in cognitive psychology, researching how people think about climate change. I'm also teaching a MOOC (Massive Online Open Course), [Making Sense of Climate Science Denial](https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x), which started last week. 

I'll be back at **5pm EDT (2 pm PDT, 11 pm UTC)** to answer your questions, Ask Me Anything! 

Edit: I'm now online answering questions. ([Proof](https://twitter.com/denial101x/status/595332406409834496))

Edit 2 (7PM ET): Have to stop for now, but will come back in a few hours and answer more questions.

Edit 3 (~5AM): Thank you for a great discussion! Hope to see you in class. ",2015-05-04 11:55:53,4980,2397,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/34tcge/science_ama_series_i_am_john_cook_climate_change/,True,Skeptical_John_Cook,1747569911.018461,climate science,scientific
