32ww7t,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: I’m Prof. Thomas Malone, from the MIT Climate CoLab, a crowdsourcing platform to develop solutions to climate change, part of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. AMA!","If there ever was a problem that’s hard to solve, it’s climate change. But we now have a new, and potentially more effective, way of solving complex global challenges: online crowdsourcing. 


In our work at the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, we’re exploring the potential of crowdsourcing to help solve the world’s most difficult societal problems, starting with climate change. We’ve created the Climate CoLab, an on-line platform where experts and non-experts from around the world collaborate on developing and evaluating proposals for what to do about global climate change. 


In the same way that reddit opened up the process of headlining news, the Climate CoLab opens up the elite conference rooms and meeting halls where climate strategies are developed today. We’ve broken down the complex problem of climate change into a series of focused sub-problems, and invite anyone in the world to submit ideas and get feedback from a global community of over 34,000 people, which includes many world-renowned experts.  We recently also launched a new initiative where members can build climate action plans on the regional (US, EU, India, China, etc.) and global levels. 


Prof. Thomas W. Malone: I am the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  I have spent most of my career working on the question of how new information technologies enable people to work together in new ways.  After I published a book on this topic in 2004 called The Future of Work, I decided that I wanted to focus on what was coming next—what was just over the horizon from the things I talked about in my book.  And I thought the best way to do that was to think about how to connect people and computers so that—collectively—they could act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has ever done before.  I thought the best term for this was “collective intelligence,” and in 2006 we started the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  One of the first projects we started in the new center was what we now call the Climate CoLab.  It’s come a long way since then!


Laur Fisher:  I am the project manager of the Climate CoLab and lead the diverse and talented team of staff and volunteers to fulfill the mission of the project. I joined the Climate CoLab in May 2013, when the platform had just under 5,000 members.  Before this, I have worked for a number of non-profits and start-ups focused on sustainability, in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and the U.S.  What inspires me the most about the Climate CoLab is that it’s future-oriented and allows for a positive conversation about what we can do about climate change, with the physical, political, social and economic circumstances that we have.

323yk3,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: We are a group of researchers from Yale and Utah State, who created a tool to visualize public opinion on climate change, Ask Us Anything!","Thanks to everyone here for great questions and a lively discussion! We are signing off now, but feel free to keep posting your questions and we will try to answer as many as we can. 

+++++
We are three researchers from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and one from Utah State University’s Department of Environment & Society. We are excited to answer your questions about how Americans in different parts of the country compare in their climate change beliefs, attitudes, and policy support.

This week, we released a new interactive mapping tool called “Yale Climate Opinion Maps” (YCOM) and an accompanying peer-reviewed paper in the journal Nature Climate Change. This tool allows users to visualize and explore differences in public opinion about global warming in the United States in unprecedented geographic detail. Nationally, 52% of Americans are worried about global warming. But this national number glosses over the enormous geographic diversity in public opinion across the country – diversity that is revealed for the first time in these maps. Explore the maps at: http://environment.yale.edu/poe/v2014/. 

We undertook this project because most of the action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate impacts is happening at the state and local levels of American society. Yet most know little about public climate change opinion at these sub-national levels. State and local surveys are costly and time intensive, and as a result most public opinion polling is only done at the national level. 

The estimates contained in the tool are based on a geographic and statistical model developed by our research team at Yale and Utah State University. The model uses the large quantity of national survey data that we have collected over the years — over 13,000 individual survey responses since 2008 — to estimate differences in opinion between geographic and demographic groupings. As a result, we are able to provide high-resolution estimates of public climate change understanding, risk perceptions, and policy support in all 50 states, 435 Congressional districts, and 3,000+ counties across the United States.
