30d1be,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: We are NASA and university scientists who study drought, “megadrought,” and how climate change can affect drought patterns now and in the future. Ask Us Anything!","UPDATE (2:19 pm EDT): Muchas gracias to all the folks that joined in. A fantastic series of questions and many great ideas. Hoping for rain here at JPL. -- Bill Patzert (on behalf of Ben, Narendra and Ben)

To keep updated on NASA climate change news on Twitter make sure to follow @NASAGISS & @NASAGoddard & @NASAJPL.

UPDATE: Hi, all! We are here and starting to answer questions! 1 pm EDT

Ben Cook -- I'm a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and a co-author on a recent paper demonstrating that climate change, by the end of the 21st century, will make droughts in Western North America even worse than the driest time periods of the last 1000 years. I study past drought events, including the Dust Bowl and the “megadroughts” of the 12th and 13th centuries, and use computer simulations to investigate how climate change and global warming will affect drought in the future.

Bill Patzert -- Hi everybody! I’ve been an oceanographer and climate scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for 32 years. My research is focused on improving our understanding of important environmental problems ranging from El Niño and La Niña to longer-term climate change, especially important water issues, like our present punishing drought in the American West. I always try to balance my scientific research with a sense of social responsibility. In the final balance, the ultimate test of any science is if it has a credible use for public policy. During my career, I have attempted to communicate what I think we do know to as many people in the science community, the general public and the private sector as I can. I look forward to your questions.

Narendra Das -- I’m a research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I currently work for the NASA’s SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission. I developed an algorithm to retrieve global, high-resolution soil moisture data from the SMAP measurements that will provide significant information to monitor agricultural and hydrological droughts, and will also help improve the skills of weather and climate models to forecast drought, its onset and recovery.

Ben Zaitchik -- I'm a hydrologist and climate scientist in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on modern day drought patterns, drought prediction, and potential changes in drought patterns under climate change. Most of my work is on East Africa and the Middle East--two regions where drought has significant human impacts, and where climate change has the potential to intensify the severity of droughts in coming years.

We’ll be online at 1 pm EST on Mar. 26 to answer your questions about the link between drought and climate change, and what NASA and other scientists are doing to understand this challenge.

2y0k2l,science,scientific,"Science AMA Series: We are Susannah Burrows and Scott Elliott, atmospheric scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory, who developed an approach to simulate how microscopic sea organisms impact cloud properties and the energy balance of the planet. AMA!","Atmospheric researchers at [PNNL](http://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=7835) (/u/Dr_Susannah_Burrows) and [LANL](https://sites.google.com/site/scottmcnevinelliott/) (/u/Dr_Scott_Elliott) worked together to develop a new approach to simulating how microscopic sea organisms known as phytoplankton – which includes a mix of algae, bacteria, and other microbes so tiny they are invisible to the naked eye – affect chemistry at the ocean’s surface. The mix is constantly made airborne by crashing oceans waves through sea spray, which ultimately impacts cloud properties and the energy balance of the planet. That’s because sea spray can influence the amount of sunlight that clouds reflect away from the Earth and its oceans, which normally act as a heat sink for the planet. A synopsis of this research is at https://www.pnnl.gov/science/highlights/highlight.asp?id=3895, and our paper, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, is available at http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/13601/2014/acp-14-13601-2014.html.
 
If you want to know how sea spray affects the warming and cooling of the planet, we’ll answer your questions about the complex interactions of aerosol particles, ocean life and cloud systems, sunlight and precipitation processes – all important factors in modeling the Earth’s climate. We will be back at 1 pm EST (10 am PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer questions … Ask us anything!
