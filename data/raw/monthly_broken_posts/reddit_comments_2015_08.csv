Source of reading on my interest of the historical North American climate.

https://www2.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html
The images presented here show the paleogeography of North America over the last 550 million years of geologic history. The 40 images shown here are selected from a suite of approximately 100 maps that are in time slices mostly 5-10 million years apart. By using such tightly spaced time slices, individual paleogeographic and tectonic elements can be followed and intuitively related from time slice to adjacent time slice. Because of space limitations only 40 of the 100 images are presented here but but most shifts of tectonic elements and depositional systems can still be followed. The maps were prepared with the core of North America (Laurentia) fixed. All other tectonic elements are shown moving against or splitting away from Laurentia, thus showing clearly accretionary and rifting events in North America's geologic history. The views were prepared by wrapping a rectangular outline map on a sphere and viewing the globe rotated to 35° N and 100° W. Various stratigraphic, tectonic, and sedimentologic data were added to the map. Topography was ""cloned"" from digital elevation maps of modern Earth from the USGS, NOAA, and other sources. Colors were adjusted to portray climate and vegetation for the given time and location. The geologic data were gathered from the references listed below.

ctptwvi,t3_3flzb4,3flzb4,science,scientific,">most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. 

This seems to be a very important distinction, and I'm amazed that the observation that the models and observations were actually showing different measurements has not been made public before this.  

There has been a claim that most of the warming i the last 15 to 18 years has gone into the oceans below the surface, and that's why the models and observations have diverged over that time period.  There are models of projected sea temperature changes, and I believe those models do not model the air 2 meters above, but actual water temperatures. 

Given that the models that we are normally presented with have historically depicted air temperatures, and 71% of the planet is ocean, where air temperatures are not measured, but water temperatures are, and given that we know that the ocean depths are warming, but water takes a lot more energy per unit temperature change, is the current use of air temperature at the surface in any way a reasonable way to depict Climate Change?  

The biggest, most often used warning issued by Climate Scientists and activists is that the world will warm by 3º ± 1.5º C after a doubling of CO2.  But, is that ""air temperature, 2 meters off the ground?"" and if we're not measuring the air temperature, 2 meters off the ground for most of the planet, should we be using a different warning altogether?

According to Wise's calculations linked to above, if we want to stop climate change, but also want 9 billion people by 2050 to have the standard of living the EU has in 2007, CO2 per dollar of GDP will have to decline from 768 in 2007, to just 14 grams per dollar by 2050.

That looks really difficult to me on first sight, so I have the following questions:

Is it really possible to reconcile the desire for economic growth with the desire to address climate change?

As both a moderator here and somebody who frequently spends (perhaps ""wastes"") a lot of timing debating with climate change deniers online, it's clear to see that many of the online commenters are just the tip of a mass media effort to redefine climate change as a political argument in order to detract from the science and make the implications of climate change something to dismiss as socialist/liberal alarmism. Many popular mass media publications regularly ridicule the scientists and science of climate change, and anyone that accepts the science in general, all the while driving home the point that it's a political issue, not a scientific or even societal one. Then reaching further up the ladder, we see entire political parties express almost venomous hate toward anything climate science, while even the governments that claim to believe the science are still mostly allowing and often encouraging fossil fuel explorations.

The plan to *prevent* meaningful action on climate change does appear to have been an enormous success.

So, my main question is, what will it take to change this?

Protesting and writing letters to our representatives doesn't appear to have done enough so far. Often it seems that people are even more politically entrenched in their opposition to climate change actions nowadays than a decade ago. Almost every national and international scientific institution has declared that climate change is real and caused by human activities, thousands of scientific reports and papers are published every year, evidence is constantly accumulating to show that we are the cause and things are already becoming unstable, yet here we still are, applying all this work and effort only for our wheels to continue spinning in the mud.

My question is about the climate thresholds.

Further, by using this global MODIS NPP dataset, you are mixing productivity of many different kinds of vegetation. For example, the climate thresholds for a cornfield in Iowa are probably different than those of a patch of Amazon forest. 

It seems like you could do a similar analysis (possibly more informative) using thresholds for specific regions and vegetation types. **Could you could rerun the analysis by dominant vegetation type (using vegetation-type specific thresholds) and show that say corn productivity will likely rise in the Midwest but soy productivity will decline in Brazil?** I'm sure you've thought of this, but I just wonder if it's feasible.",2015-08-19 12:59:54,5,thigmotroph,1747573190.21589,climate science,scientific

One of the other very odd things about this paper is how the authors have decided that it is legitimate to ""adjust"" the net primary productivity (NPP) projections from the CMIP5 models on the basis of the so-called ""unsuitable plant growth days"" which have been diagnosed from the CMIP5 climate. Irrespective of Colin Prentice's and Trevor Keenan's concerns (which I share) about the validity of these ""unsuitable days"", this seems like double-counting of climate change impacts.

The CMIP5 NPP simulations *already* take account of meteorological factors, often on a much finer timescale than Mora et al, and certainly in a way which is process-based as opposed to correlations. The HadGEM2-ES model, for example, uses meteorological and hydrological quantities on time steps of less than one hour to drive the NPP calculations. This means that the model is already not allowing plants to grow when it's too hot, dry etc. This is already factored in to the CMIP5 NPP projections. For these projections to then be adjusted further on the basis of a second (and less sophisticated) interpretation of the meteorology is giving undue weight to the unfavourable conditions.

I also find it strange that the authors pick and choose which components of the CMIP5 models they will use, without realising that all the components interact. They are somewhat dismissive of CO2 effects on plants when it comes to their effects on growth, but overlook the fact that these effects also contribute to the climate change itself through the surface energy and moisture budget. Warming over land is projected to be larger because of CO2 effects on vegetation, and this also affects evaporation and precipitation. By discarding the CO2 effects in one part of the system but not the other, the authors are introducing an inconsistency.

How (not?) to estimate changes in the suitability of days for plant growth

Posted by colinprentice on 11 Jun 2015 at 10:47 GMT

Implications of global environmental change for the growth of plants (whether as natural ecosystems, managed forests, or crops) are a hot topic. Key aspects, such as the control of leaf canopy temperatures, the ability of plants to acclimate to high temperatures, and the effectiveness of CO2 ""fertilization"" and water saving by plants at high CO2 under different environmental conditions, are incompletely understood. There are obvious concerns, for example, for regions that are undergoing increasing drought and where this trend is projected to continue, and about the major geographic changes in global agriculture that will be necessary if ""high-end"" climate change projections come about.

This paper attempts to cut through these complexities by means of an empirical analysis of net primary production (NPP) derived from satellite observations. The results are dramatically more pessimistic than previously published analyses obtained with Earth System models, which have many of their own uncertainties and problems. However, there are good reasons to suspect that these new results are strongly biased towards a ""glass half empty"" interpretation of the evidence. In summary:

1. The specific method adopted implicitly assumes that climate combinations that are rare today are unsuitable for plant growth. So for example, projected future increases in temperature and rainfall together might create novel environments that would be suitable for plant growth, but the method assumes they are not suitable. This approach produces some strange but presumably significant side-effects, such as an upper temperature threshold that is below the optimum for photosynthesis as observed in many species.

2. The quantity analysed, called MODIS NPP, is not a measurement of NPP. It is a model of NPP, that has previously been criticized for the way in which it treats plant respiration, which tends to exacerbate the modelled effects of warming on NPP.

3. The approach assumes that any positive effects of CO2 concentration on growth or water use by plants do not exist. This is one extreme position on a continuing controversy. The authors refer to an ""over-emphasis"" on CO2 fertilization in current Earth System models, but they do not present evidence for their view which is, as far as I know, impossible to reconcile with the continuing and strong uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the land.

Overall, scientific evidence points to the widespread negative consequences of global climate change. In addition, it seems like some degree of climate change is, at this point, unavoidable.

Given all of this, can you talk a little bit about how in some areas and for some crops, climate change effects (such as increased atmospheric CO2, warmer temperatures, or altered precipitation) can potentially increase crop yield?  What is your perspective on research efforts that try to capitalize on this phenomenon to try to maintain global food supply, alongside measures to attenuate climate change?",2015-08-19 16:05:36,4,neurobeegirl,1747573190.2289422,climate science,scientific

cu8q08w,t3_3hkoun,3hkoun,science,scientific,"In the end, the crucial variable we would like to predict is the total net effect of climate change on worldwide plant growth. In your research this variable is called NPP - net primary production.

1. Am I correct in understanding that ""Suitable Plant Growing Days"" is basically one of two components of NPP? Does the relationship between the two look something like this:
NPP = Suitable Plant Growing Days * Growth Per Suitable Day?

2. Doesn't this mean that even if the number of Suitable Plant Growing Days *decrease*, the total plant growth/NPP can still *increase* if the growth increase per day is sufficiently high?

3. Looking at your Fig. 6, this figure shows the NPP. It shows that NPP by 2100 will actually *increase* in every scenario - even after accounting for decreases in Suitable Plant Growing Days. Not only that, the higher the temperature becomes, the more growth will increase. In the ""worst"" scenario, RCP 8.5, plant growth will increase some 15% by 2100, after accounting for ""Suitable Plant Growing Days"". 

**So in essence, your research shows that plant growth on earth - in total - will benefit from higher average temperatures**. Yet, in the end section you are advocating reduced carbon emissions.

cts266c,t3_3dwrac,3dwrac,sustainability,action-oriented,"Great argument. I've honestly not heard many arguments from your side of the fence about agriculture. I have to agree that we should make food as efficiently as possible, with as little impact to our health and the land. I don't have a problem with GMOs as long as they are well tested (I did hear that many of the strains coming from Monsanto have certain genes that may be bad for humans in subtle ways. [This isn't the original article I read, but one i found quickly](http://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/regulators-discover-a-hidden-viral-gene-in-commercial-gmo-crops/)) and I think that they hold the key to a lot of agricultural improvement.

I'm glad that there are people in the industry like you who seem to be very level headed on the issue, but I also think that there are some general issues with farming trends that Organic farming purportedly improves. In the 100% profit driven market of farming that we see in the US, there doesn't seem to be a huge push for improving nutritional value of foods. I think the rise of mono-cultures in farming is probably a bad thing (how many of those diseases/plights from that TED talk might have been mitigated if we had greater biodiversity, do we know?). I think that farmers are still given incentive to inefficiently fertilize (e.g. getting the last 5% yield requires 50% more fertilizer but the economics still work out), leading to massive ocean dead zones which do nothing to the farmers profits but has a large societal costs (and costs to fishing industry).  I like that organics promote seasonal and local consumption, which I've been hearing more about the benefits of lately.

My question is, How do I support these sorts of improvements in agriculture in a way that doesn't blindly support organic farming, including it's demerits. I currently subscribe to a CSA and I think it is the best I can do. I assume they use organic methods for farming and strive for minimalist impact on the land. It also avoids a large amount of food waste from distributors, even if I do receive some strange looking fruits/veggies on occasion. They may be much less efficient in terms of yield, but I believe they are still probably ""better"" in terms of energy input (specifically fossil carbon produced), total toxins released and water used, per calorie grown.  I'm interested in what sorts of suggestions you might have?",2015-08-05 06:32:19,3,Tscook10,1747573613.021132,climate science,scientific
