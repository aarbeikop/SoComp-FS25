1. The joined material - can it be verified through non-destructive testing for errors?  Can this testing be done for each part on an assembly line or progressive die?  Ie. In a spot weld, you can use infrared to see areas that cool faster which indicate an air pocket or other issue since the weld should cool uniformly.  Can you use a technology such as ultrasonic or radiation to verify bonding?

2. Do you see this technology being used first person in some shape or form?  Ie. On military vehicles, a lot of the welding is done by hand.

3. As you know, maintenance cost of equipment on an assembly line can be very pricey.  This technology sounds like it can lower some of this cost.  Do you think if this technology was generic enough for prices to be competitive that it would lower the costs of maintenance on current welding lines?
