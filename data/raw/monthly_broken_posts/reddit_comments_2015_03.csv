I will start by saying I admire the positions each of you hold, and thank you all for your dedication to our planet's future. My question is with regards to high latitude peatlands. With their considerable carbon storage, estimated between 270-370 billion metric tons =40-60% of total C in atmosphere (Turunen et al. 2002), **are** these wetlands expected to experience severe drought within this century?

 Given the uncertainty of how an individual peatland may respond to long-term climate change, as well as the significant local-and-continental-scale heterogeneity of peatland types, **how** difficult is it to include high latitude peatlands in climate change models?

Sorry for all the wind, and I promise that I'm not asking you to do my homework for me! Thanks

edit: For fellow redditors, drying of peat-based wetlands can cause them to flip from being a net-sink to net-source of carbon due to increased oxidation of the vast deposits of stored organic matter. ",2015-03-26 12:08:50,18,Onlyknown2QBs,1747566223.5320709,climate science,scientific

1) Ben C. -- how well do you think the models represent land/atmosphere coupling for out-of-sample runs (i.e., do you think the CMIP5 models have the right amount of atmospheric-driven variability relative to land-surface-driven variability?  I'd guess that there is some substantial land-surface variability beyond the century time scale...)?

2) Narendra -- When do we get to play with SMAP data?!

3) Everyone -- how do you pick your baseline for comparison when discussing extreme events (like the current CA drought) in the context of weather and climate? Do we always need to put droughts into the paleo-climate reference frame?  Is CA's drought due to changes in the climate if the mean state has clearly changed in the last 100 years, but not the last 10,000 years?

I was wondering, does the organic matter released by sea spray influence upper or lower level cloud cover more?

Also, with the Arctic ocean, algal blooms over ice free areas are relatively common, and recent studies have noted [large algal blooms appearing under thin ice cover](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6087/1408.abstract) which would suggest a possible increase in microorganisms at the ocean surface. Combined with that, other studies have noted the[ increase in wave height across the Arctic ocean](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL059983/abstract) now that the buffering effect of the sea ice is much more reduced.
