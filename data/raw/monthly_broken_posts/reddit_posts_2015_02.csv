I’m Kathy Crane, an oceanographer and manager of NOAA’s Arctic Research Program (www.arctic.noaa.gov). We study the Arctic and how its physical environment is changing — and how those changes are impacting ecosystems. I also contribute to the Arctic Council’s Conservation of Flora and Fauna Working group and lead a team of U.S. Arctic experts to design and carry out observations of marine ecosystems all across the Arctic Ocean. In fact, I’ve spent a lot of time doing research in the Arctic. 

Each year NOAA leads an international group of scientists to produce the Arctic Report Card, an annual update on the Arctic environment. We take a close look at snow, ice, ocean temperatures, fish, other wildlife, air temperatures and climate. Our reports are showing that the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere on earth. These changes don’t stay in the Arctic, but have effects on people, climate and global security well beyond this region. With 2014 being recently confirmed as the warmest year on record for the globe, studying what is happening in the Arctic is more important than ever.

I’ll be here from 1:00 pm ET through 3:00 pm ET today answering your questions about Arctic climate research as well as what it’s like to work in this spectacular part of the world … AMA!

AMA!","Thanks everyone who submitted questions! If you have any more questions, please check out our current project site and ask us more questions there!  [Experiment.com/vernal](http://Experiment.com/vernal)

For anyone joining after our AMA, for the past few years we’ve worked on a project looking at wetland hydrology and animal habitat use in the Pacific Northwest.  We’re interested in how and when ponds up in the mountains dry up and get wet again, how they respond to precipitation events during the summer when animals are active, and how different animals (mainly amphibians) use the wetlands based on their hydrology (fast-drying, or slow-drying, or never-drying).  We’re interested in how wetlands respond to climate change and how this will affect the animals that use them in the future.

Currently we’re working to expand the scope of our monitoring of temporary wetlands to the east coast of North America. The data we collect there that will allow us to develop more sophisticated models of hydrologic change and its effects on wildlife.  For the past four years we’ve worked in mountain wetlands in Washington State, but this spring we will be working with vernal pools in Massachusetts.  The wetlands in both regions differ enormously in ecological context (high in the western mountains, versus down in coastal forest), but are similar in that they are temporary ponds upon which a fascinating suite of amphibians depend. We look forward to learning how to adapt our methods from one region to a very different one, and further from there.
