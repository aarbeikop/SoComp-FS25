cqxwo3x,t3_34tcge,34tcge,science,scientific,"Just playing the devil's advocate for sec because nodding in agreement hasn't brought humanity anywhere in the past. I therefore have a couple of questions:

i. Are there any scientific studies or strong arguments that you consider legitimate critisism on the current consensus in the scientific community on anthropogenic global warming?

ii. Do you presuppose that all climate change sceptics are either biased, misinformed or have alterial motives for making their claims?

iii. Do you adhere to Karl Popper's philosophy that in order to make a valid scientific statement, it needs to be possible to disprove the statement. If so, what type of data or piece of evidence would turn you into a climate skeptic?

iv. I'd also like to know what your perspective is on the feasability of reversing climate change or bringing it to a halt? In other words, do your findings on the psychology behind climate skepticism provide any leads on how to remove this attitude from the population?

cqxyt25,t3_34tcge,34tcge,science,scientific,"With regard to your infamous 97% study, could you please comment on the following:

* Why were you so resistant to releasing your data for review? Why did your university reply to requests citing made up confidentiality agreements? When your own website ""security"" leaked the data by querystring change, why did you threaten legal action? What were you afraid of with peer review?

* If your study is so concerned with accurate communication, why do you let everyone misquote your results as ""97% of scientists"" instead of the more accurate ""97% of papers we chose to include""?

* Why was your choice of papers so clearly not a representative sample? Why did it include papers about psychology and TV shows?

* How did your reviewers examine 675 scientific papers in just 72 hours? Why did they disagree WITH THE AUTHOR about the point of a reviewed paper about two thirds of the time? Why did you reviewers even disagree with each other one third of the time?

* How did you choose your reviewers? They seem to be a collection of bloggers, activists and other vested interests. Not scientists at all. 

* With respect to the timestamp data you sought to withhold, what comment do you make on the observation that it shows that you collected data, analyzed it, decided to recollect, analyzed again, then decided to change the data classification rules and have another shot at collecting the data once more? Were your results not what you wanted so you started over with shifted goalposts?

* Do you honestly believe that science should just be done by consensus ??


With regard to your Inoculation Theory article:

* Wikipedia says of inoculation theory ""This will hopefully make the receiver actively defensive and allow them to create arguments in favor of their preexisting thoughts"". Is that not just closing minds? Shouldn't people be encouraged to think freely instead of being given preexisting thoughts, and taught to harden against changing their minds?

* Is this anything other than a ploy to associate the popular vaccination movement with your movement? How should you be regarded in scientific circles if you are employing basic marketing tactics like that?

Now we learn that Alberta ""accidentally"" undercharged their royalties for oil production for the last 5 years, essentially giving a huge windfall to developers in Alberta.

Every single discussion on climate change has a comment section filled with this type of comment. None promoting climate science are actually arguing it, they are just saying others are dumb. Why is this not studied in psychology? The idea of promoting something you've no understanding of but do so for fear of being labeled dumb?

Seems rather important considering those promoting climate science want to turn economics on it's backside and do so without fully understanding what they are talking about.

And, on that note, why is there no study on those promoting climate science but pretty much denying economic science? Louis C.K. even has a bit that reddit ate up where he mocks ""the economy"" as an argument against climate change. Bill Nye, on Stossel Report, kept using ""population out of control"" as an argument because he didn't know that stronger economies support lower birth rates (many western nations, including Japan, even face issues with population declines).
