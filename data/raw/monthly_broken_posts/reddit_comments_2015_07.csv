Are any specific types of oceanic aerosols you've worked with correlated to a greater localized atmospheric temperature relative to their layer concentration in the atmosphere?

Beyond simple human industrial pollution (and I know it's anything but!) does the regional ground cover have a noticeable affect on the dispersion of naturally occurring aerosols?  Does it actually have an affect on industrial pollution as well?

Do you consider warming of the ocean to provide an addition of oceanic originating aerosols due to increased evaporation, or do you think that it is balanced or negated by decreasing wind (relative to lower atmospheric temperature difference) and less wave action/surface exposure?",2015-07-28 12:39:01,34,foxhunter,1747572138.807762,climate science,scientific

* What is the percent of aerosols in our atmosphere? 
* Of the aerosols in the atmosphere, what fraction of the total is anthropogenic? 
* Which aerosols are considered the most devastating? Why?

My first question is with regard to aerosols. The leveling off in global surface air temperatures between the 40s and 70s, and the subsequent rapid acceleration, is often attributed to industrially sourced aerosol pollution and then the clean air act respectively. We are now seeing China rapidly clean up it's act and reduce pollution levels. Might we see a substantial acceleration in global temperatures rise over the next few decades as a result?

On science communication, there has probably never been as big a battle between the scientific reality and corporate interests as we see now over climate change, with many myths and anti-climate change/science propaganda so pervasive within the public debate.

What are the current setbacks? I think it's a great idea and resource, I just wanted to have a better idea of how it works.

Why and how can the weathering and resurfacing conditions be so different between the hemispheres? Is there any explanation for this dichotomy?",2015-07-17 13:53:15,3,carljoseph,1747572157.7164302,climate science,scientific
ct6gzdc,t3_3dm6pv,3dm6pv,science,scientific,"I've seen a lot of talk about colonization, which leads to my first and second questions.

Is it likely our efforts will include plans to not destroy the planet as we have tried so valiantly to do here on Earth?

Second, how do you think human lift will be governed on Mars? Current governments, new governments, or run by whoever pays for the endeavors? How would you like to see things run?

And third, what aspect of your work do you find most exciting and/or fulfilling?

Thanks in advance!

Anyway, my question is - what are the chances of the Mars One project being successful? Do you see humans inhabiting Mars in our lifetime, or our children's lifetime?
