It seems like the scale of these phenomena make them hard to grasp. Does ice act differently at these massive scales than it does at the small ice cube scales we are more familiar with? Ice seems brittle and inelastic, but you make it sound gooey.",2015-06-05 12:50:42,109,Jobediah,1747571382.745297,climate science,scientific
crwe5az,t3_38nt2y,38nt2y,science,scientific,The greenland ice sheet is of immediate importance to the northern hemisphere due to the proximity to major populations in europe and america and particularly it's affect to the thrmohaline conveyor. However do you feel that the research is biased toward the northern hemisphere when by far the greatest and most influential mass of ice rests on antarctica?

crwei32,t3_38nt2y,38nt2y,science,scientific,"A lot of focus and research is focused on the degradation of these glaciers due to global warming, which certainly is of serious concern.  However, I'm more curious about any unique or strange processes in which a glacier grows.  Does all of a glacier's mass come from falling precipitation packing tighter and tighter, or are there other possible sources? Also, while we watch these glaciers melt, is there some level of mass being 'added' on the back-end, so to speak? ",2015-06-05 13:16:32,6,screamingcheese,1747571382.7583308,climate science,scientific

I'm from Newfoundland and we're privileged to see beautiful icebergs in early summer which are said to be 10,000 years old.  But ice coring can go back much further than that (right?) - so I've wondered if the source of those bergs newer ice, or short life cycle ice, or has it been rapidly depleting since the last ice age?  Or maybe we say it's 10,000 years old for the tourists.
