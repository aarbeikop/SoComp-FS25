cwabsfn,t3_3pxppn,3pxppn,science,scientific,"Having gone through Katrina, I'm curious how this compares in two ways: 

1. I think for most Americans Katrina is our metric for horrible hurricanes. How much worse will Patricia be?

2. Katrina is often called a man made disaster due to the various conditions on the ground that made the humanitarian situation so much worse (everything from wetland loss to an inadequate evacuation plan). Are there similar issues on the ground in the likely impacted regions? What is being done to address them? 

Lastly, if anyone wants to donate to an organization to help do you have any recommendations?",2015-10-23 18:31:03,814,firedrops,1747588876.12698,climate science,scientific

cwaby3r,t3_3pxppn,3pxppn,science,scientific,"With sustained winds over 200mph, this makes the hurricane as powerful in terms of windspeed as an EF4 tornado, except the winds experienced in a single location could last for much longer than they would in a tornado.

Given the nature of a tornado (tight, circular winds) and a hurricane (generally blowing in 1 direction, but for longer), would the damage profile between the two be similar purely due to windspeed, or would we expect significant differences?   In short, can you compare this storm to an EF4 tornado?

* Are huge storms like this a predictor that future storms will be increasing in size, or is that too hard to predict at this time?
* How are residents/visitors in coastal Mexico being warned, and how does evacuation work in those areas?
* Does this put Southern California on alert for bigger storms in the future at all?
