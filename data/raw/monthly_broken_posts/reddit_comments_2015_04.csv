My questions will be:

1- Do you know any precedent for using collective intelligent systems for designing public spaces? (I mean design in terms of visually representing the space that needs to be built)

2- Although your work is highly valuable  for finding solutions for climate change, how do you think you can involve ordinary people? The proposal writing works for highly educated people, what about tacit knowledge of ordinary people around the world?

Have you guys ever created a contest focused on this issue? 

It is quite a difficult issue to provide solutions to, mostly due to the massive scale that any chemical application would require, the fragility of marine ecosystems, and the various regulations that can make geoengineering the oceans a difficult task.

cq7nf5v,t3_323yk3,323yk3,science,scientific,"First off, the map graphic is very well done. Even though I consider myself knowledgeable on the subject, seeing the the graphic change for each question helped put in perspective how widespread each idea is. I have no doubt that if this graphic were distributed, it would have a global impact. So kudos on good work well done.

1. Is ""global warming"" to be used interchangeably with ""climate change""? The two imply subtly different ideas, with climate change typically including a broader range effects like oceanic acidification, and [this study, also in part by Dr. Leiserowitz, has shown people respond differently to each term.](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/global-warming-vs-climate-change/) Would you predict significant proportional changes in response or would you expect to see all figures rise or fall somewhat uniformly? 
2. I would consider rewording the response concerning beliefs among the scientific community to more directly imply that this is the public's beliefs concerning the scientific community's belief. At present it seems (to me) to convey that the data is the reported belief BY the scientific community rather than the population's perception OF the scientific community. [Another of Dr. Leiserowitz's studies demonstrates  up to 97% of the scientific papers published agree climate change is happening and human caused](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/scientific-and-public-perspectives-on-climate-change)
3. The ""already harming in the US"" question seems strange to me. I'm not sure how to answer that question. Smog in LA can potentially cause cancer or emphysema, but smog is a contributing factor to global warming rather than a result. Some studies have suggested certain marine ecosystems have been negatively affected by acidification but that's more of a climate change issue than specifically global warming. I'm not sure what present harm people could be citing when they say they believe it is presently harming us. Am I misinformed here, and something is presently affecting us negatively, or does this statistic demonstrate that, at least in some regard, general understanding of global warming is based out of fear rather than understanding? I understand also there are hugely dissenting theories on when we will begin to feel the effects of climate change.

I know I'm pushing it with a fourth question, but this is, in a sense, the most important. Do you believe we have a moral obligation to act in a certain consequence-conscious manner regarding issues of climate change? If we do have some obligation, how widely does it span? How could we justifiably act as individuals and as a world-community to sufficiently award praise and blame for actions with relevant consequences? (e.g. is it morally acceptable to reform industrial setting in a way which would be more difficult, stressful, or perhaps dangerous for human workers if emissions were significantly cut? Does diminishing the risk of an eventual potential global catastrophe (rising ocean levels, permanently destroyed ecosystems, specie-loss, up to eventual global extinction) justify the worsened human condition?
