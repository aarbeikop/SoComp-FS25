I have two questions:

1.  Why is climate change affecting the Arctic more severely than other parts of the world?  And what aspect of human activity in your opinion is driving these changes the most in the Arctic (transportation, industry, etc...)?

2.  What lesser-known species (besides Polar Bears) are most at risk in the Arctic due to climate change?

Firstly, with evidence growing of Arctic Amplification altering the polar jet stream and, in turn, changing mid latitude weather pattern, is this new area of research becoming more of a focus within NOAA? Related to that, do you find the tendency of the media (occasionally supported by some scientists) to quickly try and relate every weather event to climate change and AA to be a problem when trying to get across the actual science to the general public?

Secondly, with regard to native populations within the high Arctic, how much are the changes that have already happened impacting their lives and livelihoods, and how much worse could it get within the next few decades?

Finally, could you describe some of the uses your team will be making of (if any) ESA's new sentinel satellites and how they may help with monitoring of the Arctic environment over the coming decades?

2.  How screwed are we?  Are we past the tipping point really?  Is this something we just have to adapt to and survive as a species or can we actually change what is happening?",2015-02-12 12:23:18,12,recalcitrantbeatbox,1747565322.95376,climate science,scientific

coj6e60,t3_2vn8fp,2vn8fp,science,scientific,"Hi Dr. Crane. This is a wonderful AMA series. Thanks for taking part! A question:

This may be directed to Greenland and the Antarctic, but as climate change occurs and warming happens, we see continental, land-locked ice melt. Could this have a positive, scientific effect on the mapping of underwater features? 

For example, a rapid influx of sediment could not only produce turbidity flows that could be monitored, but the ever more elusive hyperpycnal flow. As sedimentation increases, and more attention is drawn to these areas, could the bathymetry be monitored more closely to see the development of contourite deposits?

I know that climate change is a real problem,  and a devastating one at that, but there has to be some positive outcomes we can use to further scientific understanding.

I feel like this will be the icing on the cake that dooms our civilization because this is in addition to all of our anthropogenic causes, and it doesn't help that methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas. Are there any roughly correct estimates for how much methane hydrate can be released?
