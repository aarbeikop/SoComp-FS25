"cnqwfbo","t3_2smkn8","2smkn8","science","scientific","I worked in an ICU where two consultants disagreed over the use of prone ventilation in ARDS cases.

Given the [PROSEVA](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1214103) study outcomes, one would be inclined to go with prone ventilation in severe cases of ARDS; but, in light of the many variables, non-modifiable and modifiable (for example [these papers](http://www.uptodate.com/contents/prone-ventilation/abstract/36,39,40) suggested that the improved survival rates was only seen in patients who received low tidal volume ventilation in prone ventilation), there is obviously room for a lot of debate on the matter. As well as this, the PROSEVA had quite a lot of limitations, namely: poorly matched patient groups and extremely sensitive exclusion criteria.

"cnr0bm1","t3_2smkn8","2smkn8","science","scientific","I am slightly confused by the aims of your research. I have been studying ARDS for awhile now, and saying ARDS is a mystery of any sort by itself or potentially directly caused by macrophages is misleading. ARDS is caused by a lack of surfactant, which lines the alveoli of the lungs, reducing surface tension and allows a very large range during normal breathing. How do we know this? Infants are the largest subgroup which suffer RDS, as the air-water interface of the alveoli are formed right when they are born. Surfactant replacement therapies (SRTs) work in infants. It is not entirely practical to use this strategy in adults though, as the surface area and therefor the total amount of surfactant needed is way more for a grown human. 

So you state the following on your site, ""responders of our immune system, are always found in lungs of patients with ARDS. However, it is unclear if there is a subset of cells that act as the main propagators of the disease."" I'm not certain where you're going with this. If someone is suffering ARDS, it should probably have something to do with the Pneumocyte-II cells simply stopping production of surfactant replacement material, or slowing down. 

I just feel like there's something you're not saying here. I want nothing more than in vivo, clinical data on ARDS, but studying lung macrophages seems like a poor choice. If there exists some sort of bacterial infection or the patient is septic, then of course macrophages will always be present. The liquid space around the epithelial lining is full of SP-D, a likely opsonin for aggressors to the human system. Sorry for the rant, I just feel like there's something missing in your reasoning. Perhaps I missed something. 

Basic questions: 

1)Why macrophages? 
2)How do you feel about next generation SRTs, such as KL4? 
3) Have you seen any progress in dealing with local inflammation during ARDS recently in the clinical setting?
4) I've heard the pre-rinsing of the patients mouth with an antibiotic wash has greatly reduced infection during intubation, is this true from your perspective?

I have a question regarding gold standard reactive care for patients that are progressively worsening with an ARDS diagnosis. Typically where I work we titrate fio2 and peep until we reach our in house maximums 100 and 20 respectively, and then explore proning and paralyzing patients. From what I've seen there seems to be a bit of ambiguity as to what order we need to progressively ramp up our care in the worsening ARDS patient. 

Is there a ""best practice"" order of operations for peep max titration, proning and paralytics? For example, should we paralyze before we prone, or prone before we paralyze? Does the origin of ARDS(sepsis or trauma) affect this equation?
