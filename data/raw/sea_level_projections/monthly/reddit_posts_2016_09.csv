Our team has completed a digital analysis of the extremely fragile En-Gedi scroll — the oldest Pentateuchal scroll in Hebrew outside of the Dead Sea Scrolls — revealing the ink-based writing hidden on its untouchable, disintegrating sheets, without ever opening it. While prior research has successfully identified text within ancient artifacts, the En-Gedi manuscript represents the first severely damaged, animal skin-based scroll to be virtually unrolled and non-invasively read line by line.

The series of digitization techniques we employed demonstrates that it is possible to “see” ink-based text within an extremely fragile scroll while avoiding the need for physical handling. The traditional approach of unrolling a scroll and pressing it flat in order to duplicate text is not an option for splintering manuscripts like the En-Gedi scroll, which has been burned and crushed into lumps of charcoal.

We began by performing a volumetric scan of the scroll using X-ray microtomography, followed by segmentation, which digitally creates a “page” containing the writing. We pieced together over 100 such scanned segments of the scroll by hand. Further manipulation of the digitized scroll involved using texturing and flattening techniques, and finally, virtual unwrapping to unveil the text written on its pages.

At last, we were able to “see” the text on five complete wraps of the En-Gedi scroll, and the resulting image is one of two distinct columns of Hebrew writing that contain legible and countable lines, words, letters, and spacing. Further analysis revealed the scroll’s writings to be the book of Leviticus, which makes it the earliest copy of a Pentateuchal book ever found in a synagogue’s Holy Ark. This virtual unlocking of the En-Gedi scroll paves the way for further scholarly analysis of this and other text buried in delicate, damaged materials.

Our research was published yesterday in Science Advances, the open-access journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Title: What It Will Take to Power 23 Million Homes With Offshore Wind

Quote:

"" For the first time, the United States government has outlined a strategy to tap an enormous source of renewable energy—offshore wind.

"" How much? According to the report, titled The National Offshore Wind Strategy, as much as 86,000 megawatts of electricity could be generated by offshore wind by 2050—enough to power 23 million homes while reducing the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 1.8 percent.

"" It won’t be easy. The plan envisions rows of giant turbines anchored off nearly every U.S. coastline within 30 years. So far, only one offshore project has made the leap from planning to construction—the Deepwater Wind project off Rhode Island. Work has nearly wrapped up on the five-turbine, 30-megawatt, $300 million venture, and it is scheduled to go online in November. ""

Unquote.

Each of the five giant wind turbines produce 6 megawatts each.

They built 5 of them for $300,000,000.00, so they are $60,000,000.00 each. Sixty million each.

Twenty-three million homes need 82,000 megawatts, so if each wind turbine produces 6 megawatts, we would need to build 14,333 of them, and at $60,000,000.00 each, we would have to spend $860,000,000,000.00, which is 860 billion dollars.

So, for nearly a trillion bucks over 30 years, we can reduce emissions 1.8%.

That is the stupidest fucking thing I ever heard of. It is awesomely, mind numbingly stupid.

Rich countries have to reduce emissions 10% per year for 50 years, just for a 50% chance of avoiding  2°C.

What will the new age of extreme super storms and accelerated sea level rise do to these windmills?

Windmills only last 30 years under ideal conditions and super-storms and accelerated sea level rise are not ideal.

People will be forced to move away from the coasts when super-storms hit, and seas start to rise one meter every decade, as James Hansen warns us. This will begin about 10 years after they are built. They won't even last 30 years. 

I can't fucking believe how fucking stupid green energy people are.
