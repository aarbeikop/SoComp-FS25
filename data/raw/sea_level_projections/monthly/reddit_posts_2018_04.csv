"8asbub","environment","emotional","It is time we were honest with ourselves. We need to end our increasingly desperate addiction to hopium.","The world’s tropical jungles/rainforests now emit more carbon than they absorb. Forests are half the size they were in 1978. And deforestation is accelerating, not decelerating. As climate heats up, even soils in temperate regions will also be unable to hold onto as much carbon as the currently do, and even more forests will be unable to take in more carbon then they release. How will we get carbon sequestration and oxygen production, then?

Marine phytoplankton, responsible for half of all the oxygen we breathe, are now down 40% in population compared to the 1950s. Oceanic warming, chemical contamination, and acidification are taking their toll. There is a real prospect that they will die off in just the next few decades due to these factors. Again, where does that leave us for carbon sequestration and oxygen production?

The frozen methane locked in shallow Arctic sea beds and in Arctic permafrost soils have already begun to outgas a decade ago: constant streams of bubbles fizz to the surface from thousands of seeps, and on land sometimes in spectacular explosions that leave massive craters that look like the aftermath of an artillery bombardment across Siberia. That pace is accelerating faster than scientists thought. We know methane is some 100 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon, but there is also twice the amount of carbon locked in these Arctic regions than currently exists in the atmosphere, ready to let go.

The runaway train ain’t stopping. We know we will have a Blue Water event by 2020 to 2025, meaning no more free-floating Arctic sea ice. Guess what that means for the albedo effect? These damned feedback loops will reinforce each other in a vicious cycle.

Yet the vast majority of the IPCC (UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)'s projections/scenarios INCLUDE the miraculous effect of un-invented, un-tested, un-scaled negative emissions technology. In other words, they are actually far too optimistic about humanity's ability to develop, test, and scale technological breakthroughs to save the planet.

No country has met targets for this past year under the Paris Agreement, which still allows countries like China and India to INCREASE carbon emissions until the 2030s before leveling off. Emissions increased worldwide in 2017.

So-called “renewable resources” like hydro, geothermal, nuclear. solar, wind, and tide... still account for less than 2% of all energy use worldwide (including transportation). Of new power generation capacity placed on-line worldwide in 2017, 75% of these power plants burned fossil fuels (coal is cheap).

Stop thinking there will be a transition. The amount of concrete and steel alone necessary to build renewable energy plants to replace all current fossil fuel plants (not including transportation): 1. is more than the world can mine and produce in decades, 2. is a massive carbon intensive process, 3. would take decades, even if all other building and construction worldwide were halted. Remember, the vast majority of new power plants under construction or in planning stages across the globe are going to be coal-fired.

For decades, every environmental article or film in mainstream media has put in a few words of hopeful messaging. But like WW2 German reports of victories, the battles being “won” seem to keep getting closer and closer to Berlin. The hopium at the end of every article or film today strains credibility. It is time we were honest with ourselves.","2018-04-08 19:30:08","105","133","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/8asbub/it_is_time_we_were_honest_with_ourselves_we_need/","True","hillsfar","1747870918.88859","sea level projections","manual"
"8ejuf7","science","scientific","Hi, Reddit! We’re scientists at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute’s Center for Conservation Genomics. We use genomics to save threatened species – ask us anything!","The Smithsonian’s Center for Conservation Genomics<https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-conservation-genomics> (CCG) uses genomics to better understand how we can care for and sustain genetically diverse animal populations in human care and in the wild. We use DNA, RNA and more to uncover information about the evolutionary history of animals and to determine the importance of genetic variation in their future survival.



This information can be used to answer questions about everything from diseases to animal behavior. We collaborate with other scientists across the Smithsonian, and with institutions and agencies around the world.



Here are just some of the things we do with genomics:

   * Use non-invasive DNA collection from feces, hair, saliva and more to help conservationists find and count endangered species ([link](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-conservation-genomics/non-invasive-dna))

   * Identify new species or use ancient DNA to determine when and if speciation reversal occurs ([link](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-conservation-genomics/news/two-species-ravens-nevermore))

   * Use DNA from century-old deceased bats to analyze how white-nose syndrome impacts bats living today ([link](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-conservation-genomics/news/bats-lab-tracking-path-white-nose-syndrome))

   * Determine the sex of a baby animals from a small DNA sample (e.g., a baby porcupine and a quill)

   * Map genomes to decode family trees of animals like Asian elephants to better understand health concerns and treatments ([link](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-conservation-genomics/news/decoding-elephants-history-save-its-future))

   * Determine if an invasive species is actually invasive ([link](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-conservation-genomics/news/scbi-researchers-use-ancient-dna-prove-arctic-ground-squirrel))



We’re doing this AMA as part of the [National Human Genome Research Institute’s National DNA Day](https://www.genome.gov/10506367/national-dna-day/) Reddit AMA series and are excited to answer any questions you have about genomics, DNA research or conservation biology! Ask us anything!



**Your hosts are:**



**Nancy McInerney**, B.S., Marquette University. I train students, researchers and visiting scientists in how genomics can be used in conservation and assist the Zoo with projects like disease detection, sex identification of newborn animals and paternity testing.

I have worked on projects including sequencing mitogenomes of California sea otters, analyzing eDNA to locate endangered freshwater turtles, monitoring the impact Chytrid fungus on amphibians and sequencing the DNA of museum specimens.



**Jesus Maldonado**, B.S. and M.S., Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania; Ph.D., University of California, Los Angeles. I have been a research geneticist at SCBI since 1998. My research applies molecular genetics tools to answer questions about conservation and evolutionary biology in mammals. I assess the genetic variation within and among populations and species to document levels of genetic diversity and determine evolutionary, taxonomic and conservation significance.



While my research has many theoretical aspects, the outcomes of these studies have direct applications that help threatened and endangered animals. I am active in education programs and have mentored more than 26 undergraduate students on research projects dealing with the population genetics of mammals, birds and reptiles.","2018-04-24 12:00:22","138","52","0.87","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8ejuf7/hi_reddit_were_scientists_at_the_smithsonians/","True","National_Zoo","1747870977.0008771","sea level projections","manual"
"88s8mb","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse q1 2018","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.
 
I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.
 
I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.
