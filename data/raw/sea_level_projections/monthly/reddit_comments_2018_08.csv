I hope aliens find our planet, analyze our fossils, and write a mildly humorous but dark comedy about our stupid civilization. Scratch that, it's much more fitting to our shitty species if nobody ever finds us and we fade out into nothingness.

**The San Onofre nuclear plant is a 'Fukushima waiting to happen'**

> Unlike the case of Fukushima, there are no federal or state evacuation plans for a disaster at San Onofre. Local first responders would be tasked with an impossible mission.

As soon as I read it, I heard the lyrics in my head answer... you gotta roll the ol' ladies. I remember once Burton Cummings said that he misses himself when he goes to sleep. I guess he must be really happy when he dreams about himself. Oh yeah, great work putting it together, as a long standing shitposter of ill repute, I appreciate the effort.","2018-08-16 09:45:37","2","SevereAnxiety76","1747875110.9064333","sea level projections","manual"

"e4as118","t3_97mi56","97mi56","sustainability","action-oriented","Yes I completely agree with you on this. I am only a sophomore in college right now, but I am studying sustainable development and either econ or compsci. Before going to college, I naively thought that individual action would be enough to make a change (like going vegan, recycling, buying sustainable clothes, etc) but its really just consumerism rebranded and sold as ‘better’. People are still falling for the easy cop out, heck I even did, but I think that’s also just because there’s not enough awareness of what’s REALLY going down. 

So what I’m conflicted about now is I’m not quite sure how to move forward. I want to make a difference, but the question is how? Everything right now seems to be not enough. ","2018-08-16 16:04:30","3","AromaticWasabi","1747875191.3994184","sea level projections","manual"
