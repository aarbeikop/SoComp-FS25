To what extent though, I don’t know; that largely depends on what the US and world economy will look like in the 20s. 

I think we’re going to see more politically motivated riots and physical confrontations break out between far-left and far-right political organizations in the run up to the 2020 election and during the immediate aftermath. I fully expect Trump to win re-election; the Democratic Party and American Left is fractured beyond belief at the moment. 

I think the US is about 15-30 years away from a violent, internal political struggle. Segments of the population are becoming increasingly polarized, and I don’t see a way to reverse the polarization; the US population is too fragmented.","2018-06-18 06:24:41","31","IGotDegreeMa","1747873159.6279612","sea level projections","manual"
"e0uxx0b","t3_8rwzv8","8rwzv8","collapse","skeptical","Because of latency (the period of time it takes the weather to catch up  with emissions) things will continue getting worse for at least the next 30 years even if all emissions were stopped as I type this sentence. Throughout the world there will be:  

increased instances of ""sunny day"" flooding (which is exactly what it sounds like)

severe storms of increasing power and frequency

greater temperatures swings (record lows and highs, sometimes days apart) 

The practical of effect of this will be severe. Food prices will rise as crops fail. Billions of dollars of infrastructure will be permanently damaged and eventually abandoned. Hordes of climate refugees (both emigrants and immigrants) will overwhelm those of us lucky enough to be in semi-habitable areas (semi habitable because the summers here are already becoming too hot).  

There's a very good chance the next recession will be caused by the insurmountable debts of oil companies that invested too heavily in unconventional oil. If this happens I expect it to be the death knell of industrial civilization. The so called ""seneca effect"" comes into play and within 20 years (if we're insanely lucky) the industrial age will be completely over. 

Because cheap conventional oil makes everything else cheap the lack of cheap conventional oil will make everything way too expensive for the average idiot to afford. Things like cellphones, personal automobiles, air conditioning will strictly be the realm of the wealthy. Billions will die of starvation or war. The deaths will begin in developing nations. Massive death tolls every week: 

""At least 500,000 have died in Sudan over the past 7 months. Mostly do to starvation and malnutrition""  

""Ecuador declares a state of emergency. An estimated 300,000 people are living on less than one meal a week""

""riots in China over food shortages. . .""

""Yesterday the Indian Government appealed to the UN for more food aid . . .""

Shortly the worst will spread to industrialized nations. When it does the possibility of world war increases dramatically; including the possibility of a complete or partial nuclear exchange.  ","2018-06-18 06:49:22","30","bucktoot","1747873159.631966","sea level projections","manual"

"e0v8u38","t3_8rwzv8","8rwzv8","collapse","skeptical",">The main topic of concern is climate change. The other topic pertains to social drift toward an Orwellian government, oligarchy and fascism. The two are related.

It is notable that the world government is already Authoritarian and Totalitarian. We are already living in a total surveillance state, everything I type right now goes through GCHQ in the UK is run through a bank of analytical algorithms to determine if I am a threat to the Government. Some tech companies notably Samsung have been found to have surveillance systems built into their consumer electronics. You TV is watching you with a hidden cam and listening with a hidden mic Via your WiFi connection. You are not safe to have privacy even within your own living room. I can see this abuse of technology and power giving rise to people being rounded up and arrested in the middle of the night and taken away to ""re-education"" facilities in due time. 
I know this sounds conspiracy but I would not at all be shocked to see this come to pass.

Why would they do this? to prevent an uprising. To remove leaders and organisers and dissenters who would work to overthrow the regime before the seeds can grow into an organised movement. 

>The climate thing has a cliffhanger vibe in my outlook. I see a lot of technological potential for humanity to move toward a more sustainable model. I think advances with batteries, desalination, synthetic meat and dairy. CCS, etc. will give us at least the theoretical capability to avoid an apocalypse.

I disagree. Yes you are correct about human potential. We can if we wanted to, engineer our way out of this, or at least ensure our survival either in space or in bunkers etc...  But the problem is everything comes down to MONEY. Always with the money. And to really TRY to fix this and save ourselves as I have been told time and time again, would bankrupt the planet and cause total economic collapse. And social collapse.  So no, it will not happen. 

>Given the delay between forcing from greenhouse levels and climate equilibrium and the fact that transition away from fossil fuels will take time, I think we're committed to increasing gg levels until at least mid-century and will approach CO2 ppm of 500 minimum.

I strongly believe we are heading towards 500 ppm within 5 years time. I know I will be criticized for saying this, (state your source! state your source!) I think this year has been different to any year before it. I think things are accelerating and we are told on a daily basis ""happening faster than predicted"" I think things are going to take off to the moon and back and we will reach 500ppm by 2023. Let's see if I am right.

I have no advice to give, I do not know of any place on earth that is not in danger and is not run by a nightmarish totalitarian regime. I would love to find some remote location far out of the reach of humanity and safe enough to withstand climate change for the duration of my own life where I could live in peace and farm my own food and be happy. But I don't think such a place exists on this planet.","2018-06-18 12:52:48","10","Robinhood192000","1747873159.6479669","sea level projections","manual"

currently there are people using cell phones in countries with authoritarian states but no running water and rare or intermittent electricity, living in mud huts and tin shanties yet police are still funded to harrass them and make thier lives more miserable. 

That is already real life for people and there is no reason why that future will no be expanded to larger swathes of the global population. hi-Tech and collapse are compatible until the system truly reaches criticality and crucial parts of the system break and cascade to break other supply systems and power structures.

"e0vw6d9","t3_8rwzv8","8rwzv8","collapse","skeptical","Having been thinking about this stuff for over ten years already, and having seen what has and hasn't changed in the last decade, it's been really hard for me to pin down what I think the world will look like. But the answer I've given a lot of people is that I simply believe life will look a lot different when I'm old than it does now. That is, if I don't kill myself in the next 10 years or so....

There's just so much shit going on, it's impossible to know how it will all interplay. Overpopulation, climate change, social and economic changes, the race to ""fix"" all of it with technology and policy changes....

Climate change just isn't going to be fought in any meaningful way. Or, rather, once the beginnings of the ""worst case scenarios"" start to show, it will probably cause panicked reactions from governments from all over the world -- well after it's been deemed ""too late."" It's already too late. Maybe not to avoid worst-case-scenarios, but at least to stop or reverse it. A new article surfaces on a major media outlet every few days about how we're already past one tipping point or another, or crossed a point of no return.

The global population will continue growing for at least a few more decades, at which time it will ""stabilize."" Resource scarcity, food crises, relocation emergencies will surely follow. Migration and refugee crises will surely become worse over time.

Peak oil will continue to be pushed back and back -- until it can't be anymore. I remember reading about it having peaked in 2005. It's just creeping along, looming in the background. It hasn't torn society apart yet, like I was led to believe when I was a teenager. But it might. Or it might be uneventful, in the landscape of other shit going bad.

The widening gap between the richest and the poorest is sure to get wider still, with most of us in the middle being pulled one way or another. It's already fairly normal for people to have 2 jobs or more just to support themselves. The poorer half will likely see their work hours climbing just to maintain the same level of living, while the richer half will continue to take vacations and live as if nothing has changed.

(Related: Looking for work in Northern Michigan.)

Online shopping is driving more and more businesses away. Automation is making more and more jobs unnecessary. A growing population creates the need for more work, and technological progress creates an undeniably better experience for many areas of business and life makes more of those jobs unnecessary. You have a tug-of-war happening. And the technology has always won. The jobs are going to continue to disappear. Sooner or later universal basic income will have to be addressed in a real way. But because in much of the world the political will -- or even willingness to talk or think about it -- isn't there, it won't happen. So those who depended on the jobs that disappear become poorer yet. But the war between haves and have-nots? It'll probably never come about. Instead, someone will profit off of the slums.

None of it is going to happen fast or dramatically, unless the unexpected happens. A large-scale single season/year food shortage would make things interesting -- but probably won't happen. We're taking one of the 99 bottles of beer off the wall, passing it around, and reaching for another. Hell, when you still have 98, 97, 90, 80 -- things are still looking pretty good. Even when you only have 20 left, it doesn't look so bad.

But late in the night when we're all fucked up, someone realizes we're almost out and they need to go on a beer run. Only the store went out of business, the brewery got bought out by BrewCorp, they've been using toxic water, the price of barley skyrocketed, the car is almost out of gas and no one has money to pitch in for the $8/gallon gas prices, let alone the beer. Most of us are still making just barely above minimum wage and we have work in the morning. This was our one day off.

A lot has been happening out there while we were partying -- and we probably couldn't have changed a single thing even if we were paying attention.

---

I don't know, it's going to be a strange and uncomfortable ride. I figure by 2050 things will look pretty unrecognizable, but even that's just random guessing. Our children will have completely different lives.

The internet and technology are sticking around, as far as I can see. So we'll have this strange mix of screens and distractions, even as most of us have to work harder to get less.

I probably chose wrong 10 years ago, when I decided not to pursue a lucrative career where I could put away a lot of money. But even then I didn't see the point in getting invested into a way of life I wasn't sure would be around much longer. Even for those who chose a different path, I don't know how much real wealth they'll have to show in 30 or 40 years. I see friends who are buying property and building homes, and I envy them -- but also shudder when I think about owing to a bank for 30+ years. 30 years is a long damn time to trust that all of this is going to hold together.

One of the only things I have going for me is that I'm smart and adaptable. But I'm not sure how much that is worth. ","2018-06-18 18:53:04","2","naked_feet","1747873159.6599658","sea level projections","manual"
