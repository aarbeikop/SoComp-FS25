As ever dire studies continue to reaffirm worst case scenarios, it should be clear to anyone paying attention that in the next century the Earth will be unrecognizable from its current state. Basic planetary geography and atmospheric conditions will be altered through warming oceans and rising sea levels which are [now increasing faster than at any time in the past 2800 years](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517056113). On average, [sea levels were between 50 and 82 feet higher the last time CO2 levels were at 400ppm](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-3-2.html). CO2 levels are now increasing around 3ppm per year, [a twentyfold increase since pre-industrial times when the highest recorded increase was 0.15 ppm per year](https://theconversation.com/mass-extinctions-and-climate-change-why-the-speed-of-rising-greenhouse-gases-matters-56675). In our warming world, the hydrologic cycle is changing and [creating extreme weather](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/06/02/3664087/weather-whiplash/); crop-destroying droughts and floods are becoming more frequent. Rising winter temperatures are beginning to destroy the ""winter chill"" needed for many fruit and nut trees to properly blossom and produce maximally. Climate change is also [disrupting flower pollination](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/06/climate-change-is-disrupting-flower-pollination-research-shows). We've long since passed [the tipping point of melting Arctic summer sea ice](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/275/2013/tc-7-275-2013.pdf); 300-350 ppm of CO2 was the threshold for many parts of the climate. These changes are irreversible on a timescale of human civilizations. Even if all human industrial activity magically ceased today, the footprint man has already left will be felt for eons.

Homo sapiens have only been on the planet for the equivalent of a few seconds in geologic time but have managed to overwhelm and foul up all of earth's natural processes and interdependencies, leaving [a distinct layer in the sedimentary record](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/humans-leave-a-telltale-residue-on-earth1/). There is nothing modern humans do that is truly sustainable. Here are a few glaring examples: 

- [Techno-fixes are built into the IPCC's projections for maintaining a habitable planet for humans.](https://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/tag/green-capitalism/) 

- Remember this headline from 2013?: [Arctic methane release could cost economy $60 trillion -study](http://www.reuters.com/article/arctic-methane-idUSL6N0FT1PU20130724). Our response was to go on a fracking binge which [increased our methane emissions by some 30%](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/u-s-methane-emissions-on-the-rise).

- While the resource intensity of GDP may be falling (less resources needed to produce 1$ worth of goods/services), the *absolute* decoupling of resource use, emissions, pollution, etc from GDP growth is the only thing that matters and [that is not happening](http://cleantechnica.com/2016/01/15/the-false-promise-of-decoupling-gdp-growth-from-resource-consumption/). 
If the world's population continues to grow as projected and current lifestyles do not change, [global resource consumption will increase anywhere from 2 to 5 times by 2050](https://books.google.com/books?id=sxDHBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=%22global+resource+consumption%22+%22by+2050&source=bl&ots=xwt_obWm7k&sig=nm1m5BJwXcOjZHT8C2o9Kt5wlGk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7-dHz0sXLAhVS3WMKHVR3CVQ4ChDoAQgdMAE#v=onepage&q=%22global%20resource%20consumption%22%20%22by%202050&f=false). It defies logic that a continually growing economy would be able to reduce its resource intensity down to near-zero to achieve a sustainable ecological footprint.

- According to [recent research](http://phys.org/news/2011-06-afforestation-dent-problem.html), even if we converted 100% of farmland to reforestation projects it would only lower temperatures 0.45C by the end of the century. Converting half of global farmland to reforestation would result in just a 0.25C drop. Other recent studies have come to the same conclusion:

>**""No amount of reafforestation or growing of new trees will ultimately off-set continuing CO2 emissions due to environmental constraints on plant growth and the large amounts of remaining fossil fuel reserves,"" Mackey says. ""Unfortunately there is no option but to cut fossil fuel emissions deeply as about a third of the CO2 stays in the atmosphere for 2 to 20 millennia.""** - [Link](http://bio-fuel-watch.blogspot.com/2013/12/biofuelwatch-reforestation-is-not.html)

Relying on machines for answers to the existential problems of a species run amok with planet-destroying tools and weaponry is rather ironic and tragic. We're locked-up inside a complexity trap of our own making. The human propensity for tool-building coupled with our discovery of fossil fuels has created a set of living arrangements in which we are now enslaved to those machines and tools. The globalized capitalist economy externalizes its destruction and atrocities, keeping the masses in a state of ignorance and denial. Despite the best efforts of scientists, environmentalists, and activists, the wealthy countries most able to do something won't ""get it"" until famine, disease, and war come to their country. And this is all being left for the 'free market' to sort out at the same time that climate change, a conflict multiplier, ramps up.
