"dark3wv","t3_5gb9wg","5gb9wg","environment","emotional","No. Did 10s of millions of marchers stop the Iraq war? No. Did millions of marchers make a difference with OWS? No. This kind of marching wastes time and energy that could be used to apply pressure better in more effective ways. Record marches in Wisconsin stop killing unions there? Did marches in Michigan stop them from privatizing water and poisoning Flint with lead? No. 

It breaks my heart to see good movements expend tons of energy and resources on things that are not very effective.  Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to waste energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does nothing by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches and sit-ins that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT THEY COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. So these actions just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not just the noisemaking. 

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the marches.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 

But today the public doesn't know what to do when faced with this challenge. They think that yelling in crowds makes a difference when all it does is get them put in some database. 

There are better alternatives. Take this guy who instead of holding a sign that was ignored, [buried a bad cop in paperwork](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/hostile-policing/Content?oid=17445843) and the evidence of this bad cop's activities [got him fired](http://www.king5.com/story/local/2014/09/02/13384714/). 

> Reply here to keep brainstorming. It feels good to at least be doing something.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective.

I could live with a Trump presidency if he switched only one of his political stances... climate change is real and it is caused by mankind and it must be stopped and reversed as soon as humanly possible.

His alleged racist and sexist principals, his belief in the USA being a Christian nation, his pro-big business doctrine and everything else I would ~~happily~~ grudgingly live with if he could just commit to protecting the planet.

Edit: We should invite Trump and his children to the March as well. I don't think they truly believe the nonsense preached by 1% of climate scientists around the world. We need to surround the president with people who love the earth and can convince him that it is in his best interest, both monetarily and politically, to switch his way of thinking. What better way to do this than have him front and center of the movement? He won't turn around overnight, but any gradual shift will be far better than the alternative.

Do your calculations account for the greater carbon emissions spent exploring in more remote regions, for more extensive geophysical surveys and dry wells for basins with smaller and less identifiable reservoirs, and for the higher development and maintenance emissions of deepwater fields?

I'd imagine the pre-tax/royalty financial costs for exploration and development in a basin, incorporating dry well expenses, amortized over production and added to extraction costs, might serve as a better proxy for emissions than measures of direct fuel expenditures for development (eg, drilling & fracking) and extraction (eg, SAGD & upgrading).

No.

That's not the way it works. Not at all.

We've diverted a small portion of the energy we derive from burning fossil fuels as fast as we possibly can (I do think it is in many ways an end in itself - the shiny, plastic crap we seem to prize so highly is just some sort of byproduct - a token that validates our raw consumption,) into building some renewablez, but they're (seemingly deliberately) designed to be short-lived, even in operation are often reliant on regular (if not continual,) fossil fuel inputs, and will all wear out in a couple of decades anyway and need to be replaced with another round of (even more) expensive fossil fuel inputs and resource raping (if that's even still possible then.)

This will just give them one more excuse to keep the fossil fuels burning for longer.

The true solution is unappealing, but simply this:

Stop. Burning. Shit. Now.

All of it. Just stop.

Learn to live with less.

> The remarkable pace of innovation will have at least some effect on the shape and size of our carbon pulse – I do hope it is to the good.

Sadly it won't be, and can't be. It is precisely the ""remarkable pace of innovation"" and our incontinent industriousness that drives the destruction.

The only way out of this madness is to just stop doing this crazy shit. We should have stopped doing this crazy shit centuries ago (when we still could have without killing us all,) but we didn't.

But that's not going to happen until reality forces us to, because now we've ratcheted ourselves so far up the progress ladder, that we recognise that a fall from this height would kill us all (or at least a sufficiently huge proportion of us to make provoking collapse an unappealing prospect for the majority of sheeple,) and make life a good deal less comfortable for any survivors.

No, technology and progress and growth are not, and never will be the solution. They are the very crux of the problem, and the more of them we get, the fuckeder we inevitably become (and with us, all other life on this once magnificent planet.)

It is only fudging or discounting the costs and energy flows of our technological society that permits this delusion to persist that somehow we can beat the laws of thermodynamics.

Science has laid bare the consequences, and politicians have finally listened. You may find the policy changes meagre, but they matter and they will grow. Also, we can’t deny that we’ve had a pulse of innovation including efficient and cheap renewable energy, power reduction of appliances, electric cars, “sustainable” building materials, and so on. It’s not enough to stop the warming, but it’s not bad.

This is just not factual at all, it is just hopium and speculation at best. There is no incentive for countries to stop deforestation, mineral mining, intensive agriculture and animal farming. The problem is not global warming because as you said those consequences are far away. The problem will be running out of fresh water sources and fertile soil, running out of oil and precious minerals to build solar panels and the such, also no oil=no infraestructure as a whole. Besides, the third world will continue to develop and increase its footprint and even if the developed countries suddenly become ""green"" (There is no such thing) the carbon footprint will be inherited by South America, India, etc. Sorry to break it to you, but there will be no miracle leapfrogging into clean energy.

I'd recommend you take a look at these articles. Renewables are a fantasy, as well as any form of sustainable development. The only way for us to stop being the cancer of our planet would be to ditch civilization as a whole.

Note to other essayists: to avoid composing so much twaddle, it is best not to set some arbitrary number for reasons for optimism. Are there really *Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover* or *Fifty Shades of Grey*?

Once, when expounding my grim views of the human prospect on another Reddit site, I encountered a very thoughtful young person, who having just discovered the enormity of the approaching catastrophe, spoke of the futility of his life.
