"di9hbwy","t3_6eba1d","6eba1d","climatechange","action-oriented","There are no credible scientific projections that all of Florida will be underwater in 20 years. Go back and read the IPCC reports back to the first one in 1990, which projected 30 cm of sea level rise by 2030 and 65 cm by the end of the 21st century. The fifth assessment report, published in 2013, projects 52-98 cm by 2100 in a high emissions scenario, and 28-61 cm over the same timeframe even with aggressive emissions reductions. So the scientific projections are being refined somewhat but they're on the same order of magnitude over the same timeframe. Florida being completely underwater - which would require dozens of feet of sea level rise - is not and has not been projected for the coming century.

It is not clear that Antarctica is gaining ice. In fact, the majority of studies based on data sets from probes like NASA's GRACE satellite gravimetry instrument have found that it is losing ice. The study you cited argues that, making certain assumptions about the density of the top layer of the ice sheet in East Antarctica, ice change would be slightly positive. The range of other estimates go into the strongly negative. More research is required to figure out exactly where we are within that plausible range, but it's much better to look at the range of credible estimates rather than a single result. And in any case, the trends are the same, with GRACE showing a change from somewhat negative a couple decades ago to strongly negative in recent years, and Zwally's study showing somewhat positive a couple decades ago to only very slightly positive in recent years. So either the rate of accumulation is slowing to almost nothing, or the rate of ice loss is accelerating, so regardless of exactly where we are on balance the researchers agree on the overall directionality. Furthermore, Zwally acknowledges that their estimates are somewhat problematic, because without the melting contribution from Antarctica, the sea level rise that we're actually seeing now must include some yet undiscovered mechanism. More discussion on that here, via a climatologist with University of Bristol: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2015/11/so-what-is-really-happening-in-antarctica

I would recommend vetting your information regardless of where you get it from to see how it compares to the peer-reviewed literature. Don't trust random things you see on the internet regardless of which way they argue without doing a little bit of background research to determine if the source is credible. Well-respected, long-standing scientific journals like Science, Nature, Geophysical Research Letters, etc. are the sources you should trust, not bloggers, partisan media, or other sources that might be biased or ill-informed.","2017-05-31 08:00:46","9","BreadstickNinja","1747860626.8860018","sea level projections","manual"

Climate change affects different parts of the world differently, in this article it said previously the air was too cold and dry to snow in this area of Antarctica but not anymore.

This injury has left her severely cognitively impaired, but also resulted in aphasia. Her life would be significantly improved with the ability to communicate. What are the advancements being made with regard  to BMI that may soon apply to these conditions? Also, I see promising research with regard to stem cell therapy and stroke, but none concerning severe DAI. All the focus latley has been with regard to NFL and sports related concussions. Is DAI research not a viable path for funding?
Thank you.  ","2017-05-11 14:14:19","2","metalman74","1747861028.2978718","sea level projections","manual"

Do you think the idea of using neurological transmitters and brain-matter over more traditional electronics has any merit? To which extent do you think it could be used? (Does our limited understadning of how the brain works set any hindrances for implementation? What do you think of the ethics of cultivating a fully functional brain only to put it into a machine? How might the technological differences (e.g. transmission speeds) influence the usability?)","2017-05-11 14:19:22","2","Retepss","1747861028.2978718","sea level projections","manual"

He is 8 years now and is of normal intelligence and speech. He has a left sided foot drop and severe stiffness on his left leg needing botox injections at least once a year. I take him through a set of exercises integrating yoga and strengthening work to try and minimise the atrophy of the musculature on the left side. The real challenge has been improving co-ordination between the left and the right side. My question is: At what age does neuroplasticity diminish or stop. At what age will the benefit from therapy start to decrease or stop. ","2017-05-11 14:41:04","2","drdeepakjoseph","1747861028.2978718","sea level projections","manual"

"dhfbbr7","t3_6ajjkh","6ajjkh","science","scientific","Thank you for doing this AUA! This topic is something I'm very curious about, and I have a few questions:

In the future, do you see this sort of therapy involving electrical stimulation to areas of the brain overtaking drug-based therapies?

Also, I know DBS has showed promise for conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Depression, but how could it be more effectively paired with the medications also shown to have positive effects on these illnesses? 

Finally, this year, I got to speak with a woman currently part of a trial for DBS for Alzheimer's, and her and her husband found it very frustrating that they could not try other treatments while participating in the trial. I am well aware of the necessity to control variables in any experiment, especially a clinical trial, and if she were to start another treatment that would introduce large extraneous variables into the study. However, can you envision any way in which patients like this woman would be able to benefit from multiple experimental treatments at once? While it may not be as good for the scientific process or future patients who could benefit from the approval of a treatment, it seems it would be better for the patient currently participating in the trial.
