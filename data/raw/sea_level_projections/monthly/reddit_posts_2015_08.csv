"3hcv8k","climatechange","action-oriented","Where's the heat?","My understanding is that it can be found on neither [RSS or UAH](http://www.climate4you.com/images/AllCompared%20GlobalMonthlyTempSince1979.gif) along with a few other supporting global datasets until recently, when they used the adjustments from Karl et al 2015.  

Karl et al 2015 uses SST data to adjust ARGO data and determines the heat is in the ocean. Though the recent trans indo-pacific paper entails there is no heat below 700m, and likely lies within 100-300m of the ocean's surface.   

The [USCRN and USCHN](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=cmbushcn&parameter=anom-tavg&time_scale=p12&begyear=2005&endyear=2015&month=12) which are significant due to their stations being designed to observe the climate, not the weather (Having been placed in locations where development is not expected for 50-100 years, thus requiring minimal adjustment for UHI and other affects) ranging from Russia, Alaska, Canada, to various locations in the US, Mexico and Hawaii. About 6% of the landmass on earth, but none the less one of the best built to purpose networks we have...shows no significant warming.     

--------  

Now obviously the ocean + land = surface, ergo heat on the ocean = heat on the surface.   
Heat in the ocean however should have a secondary affect, one that we have been warned about quite a few times actually.   

Sea level rise.    

Heat in water causes expansion which of course affects SLR. So logically the heat (not in the atmosphere, likely not on the land, but in the ocean) should be causing expansion and thus increase SLR exponentially as heat continues to rise exponentially.   

---------------  

And here's the problem, it hasn't.

>What was learned
Over the nine years of their study, the three researchers report that the mean GIA-adjusted mass gain and mass loss in the 19 areas of their primary focus amounted to -(0.7 ± 0.4 mm/year) of sea-level fall and +(1.8 ± 0.6) mm/year of sea-level rise, for a net effect of +(1.1 ± 0.6) mm/year. Then, to obtain a figure for total sea-level change, they added the steric component of +(0.5 ± 0.5) mm/year, which was derived by Leuliette and Willis (2011), to their net result to obtain a final (geocenter neglected) result of +(1.6 ± 0.8) mm/year and **a final (geocenter corrected) result of +(1.7 ± 0.8) mm/year.**

>What it means
The final geocenter-corrected result of Baur et al. is most heartening, as Chambers et al. (2012) indicate that ""sea level has been rising on average by 1.7 mm/year over the last 110 years,"" as is also suggested by the analyses of Church and White (2006) and Holgate (2007). **Concomitantly, the air's CO2 concentration has risen by close to a third. And, still, it has not impacted the rate-of-rise of global sea level!**   

Corroborated by NOAA's ""The Budget of Recent Global Sea Level Rise 2005–2012""   

>The sum of steric sea level rise and the ocean mass component has a trend of 1.1 ± 0.8 mm/a over the period when the Paulson GIA mass correction is applied, well overlapping total sea level rise observed by Jason-1 and Jason-2 (1.3 ± 0.9 mm/a) within a 95% confidence interval.   

And Chambers et al

> sea level has been rising on average by 1.7 mm/year over the last 110 years  

Further, it appears to have slowed.

>These new calculations highlight a reduction in the rate of sea level rise since 2005, by ~2 mm/yr. **This represents a 60% reduction compared to the 3.3 mm/yr sea level rise (glacial isostatic adjustment correction applied) measured between 1993 and 2005.** Since November 2005, MSL is accurately measured by a single satellite, Jason-1. **However the error analysis performed here indicates that the recent reduction in MSL rate is real.**  

Along with evidence that mankind has no affect on the sea level.

>We propose that: thermal expansion simulated by climate models may previously have been underestimated owing to their not including volcanic forcing in their control state; the rate of glacier mass loss was larger than previously estimated, and was not smaller in the first than in the second half of the century; the Greenland ice-sheet could have made a positive contribution throughout the century; groundwater depletion and reservoir impoundment, which are of opposite sign, may have been approximately equal in magnitude. We show that it is possible to reconstruct the timeseries of GMSLR from the quantified contributions, apart from a constant residual term which is small enough to be explained as a long-term contribution from the Antarctic ice-sheet. The reconstructions account for the approximate constancy of the rate of GMSLR during the 20th century, **which shows small or no acceleration, despite the increasing anthropogenic forcing.** Semi-empirical methods for projecting GMSLR depend on the existence of a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR, **but the implication of our closure of the budget is that such a relationship is weak or absent during the 20th century.**   


---------------   

So no rising heat in the atmosphere, no rising heat from the CRN. Most papers agree it's in the ocean, but the ocean doesn't appear to be responding. So either the heat is negligible, or the ocean is handling it. [I also have studies indicating acidification isn't a concern]   

Ultimately there's no reasons we can't attempt to cut our emissions and work on viable renewable power sources. Like nuclear for instance. Though the heat either appears to be far less than what was predicted, or is having a negligible affect.

"3im8ln","climatechange","action-oriented","Dissemination of the ""Scientific Consensus""","**What is it?**   

Popularized by John Cook's (in)famous paper in which a number of studies were collected and cataloged to find a ""Consensus"" of 97% of all scientists supporting....well that's the first problem.  
AGW occuring was the original intent, but ""Scientific consensus"" gets thrown at just about anything now. Sea level rise, dangerous weather conditions, dangerous PH levels in the ocean, any feasible effect of climate change, anthropogenic or otherwise, often gets the ""consensus"" argument thrown at it.   

-------
**So what's the problem?**   

Aside from how it's often used (appeal to authority, peer pressure) is the fact that the John cook study, along with several others often used to prop up the presumed ""consensus"" aren't actually a representation of the entire scientific community *or* a consensus on AGW and its effects.    


For instance: [Cook et al 2013](https://wryheat.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/cooks-consensus.jpg) only covers papers, not scientists themselves explicitly. Of those papers, only .5% explicitly endorse and and quantifies AGW as 50% of greater the cause of warming, from his own sample. 
This graph simply represents the text document (Address listed in the image) in which the papers are properly addressed.   
This is the briefest and simplest explanation of what is wrong with his study, though there are plenty of verbose and far more detailed dissemination available upon request (or a simple google search :P).    

Also consider, 11,944 papers not necessarily scientists, though nearly 8000 of those had no position. So lets aim a little high and say 3944 can be shown to support AGW as the primary cause of warming from this study.     
Some modest estimates for how many academic scientists exist in the world ring up around 10-12 million.

I'm happy to point out the flaws in any said studies, should someone have them available, though they often fell into one of the following problems regarding consensus:  

*   Small sample size  

*  Vague questionnaire (very open questions)   

*  Not determining confidence   

*  Not determining whether AGW is detrimental or what degree can be 

--------

Further, being generous let's say that between cook et al 2013 and several other studies, we triple the number of scientists who hold consensus on AGW, assuming they aren't counting the same people twice, the surveys ask the right questions, etc. We end up with 11832 scientists who support AGW theory and quantify it as having caused 50% or more of our warming.

-----------   

**The bottom line**  

Consensus doesn't matter in science. It's irrelevant.    

Yesterday's popular theory could be today's debunked one. An excellent example is Karl et al 2015, a study which used (until the point) adjustments no one else really had within NASA, NOAA the British oceanic institute, it bore little resemblance to IPCC projections as well.    

And yet, it explained why the pause doesn't exist. Considered an anomaly by some that, by rights simply shouldn't exist, this breakthrough gave them the explanation they were looking for, and was adopted by many.    
Whether or not Karl et al 2015 will stand the test of time is another question entirely, though this is a perfect example of how consensus means little in science.   

Politics aside, it has no place in science. Scientests may form a consensus on reliable studies, but reliable studies are not formed through scientific consensus.

I’m Jim Hansen, a professor at [Columbia University’s Earth Institute]( http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9).<http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sections/view/9> I'm  joined today by 3 colleagues who are scientists representing different aspects of climate science and coauthors on papers we'll be talking about on this AMA.

--Paul Hearty, paleoecologist and professor at University of North Carolina at Wilmington, NC Dept. of Environmental Studies. “I study the geology of sea-level changes”

--George Tselioudis, of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies; “I head a research team that analyzes observations and model simulations to investigate cloud, radiation, and precipitation changes with climate and the resulting radiative feedbacks.”

--Pushker Kharecha from Columbia University Earth Institute; “I study the global carbon cycle; the exchange of carbon in its various forms among the different components of the climate system --atmosphere, land, and ocean.”

Today we make the case for urgent action to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are on the verge of locking in highly undesirable consequences, leaving young people with a climate system out of humanity's control. Not long after my 1988 testimony to Congress, when I concluded that human-made climate change had begun, practically all nations agreed in a 1992 United Nations Framework Convention to reduce emissions so as to avoid dangerous human-made climate change.  Yet little has been done to achieve that objective.

I am glad to have the opportunity today to discuss with researchers and general science readers here on redditscience an alarming situation — as the science reveals climate threats that are increasingly alarming, policymakers propose only ineffectual actions while allowing continued development of fossil fuels that will certainly cause disastrous consequences for today's young people. Young people need to understand this situation and stand up for their rights.

To further a broad exchange of views on the implications of this research, my colleagues and I have published in a variety of open access journals, including, in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648),
[PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone), [Assessing Dangerous Climate Change: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648), and most recently, [Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from the Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling that 2 C Global Warming is Highly Dangerous](http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/2015/20150704_IceMelt.pdf), in [Atmos. Chem. & Phys. Discussions](http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/volumes_and_issues.html) (July, 2015).

One conclusion we share in the latter paper is that ice sheet models that guided [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](http://www.ipcc.ch/) sea level projections and upcoming United Nations meetings in Paris are far too sluggish compared with the magnitude and speed of sea level changes in the paleoclimate record. An implication is that continued high emissions likely would result in multi-meter sea level rise this century and lock in continued ice sheet disintegration such that building cities or rebuilding cities on coast lines would become foolish.

The bottom line message we as scientists should deliver to the public and to policymakers is that we have a global crisis, an emergency that calls for global cooperation to reduce emissions as rapidly as practical. We conclude and reaffirm in our present paper that the crisis calls for an across-the-board rising carbon fee and international technical cooperation in carbon-free technologies. This urgent science must become part of a global conversation about our changing climate and what all citizens can do to make the world livable for future generations.

**Hello there, /r/Science!**

We* are a group of researchers who just [published a paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064888/abstract) showing previous comparisons of global temperatures change from observations and climate models were comparing slightly different things, causing them to appear to disagree far more than they actually do.

The lead author Kevin Cowtan has a backgrounder on the paper [here](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/robust2015/background.html) and data and code posted [here](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/robust2015/methods.html). Coauthor /u/ed_hawkins also did a background post on his blog [here](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2015/an-apples-to-apples-comparison-of-global-temperatures/). 

Basically, the observational temperature record consists of land surface measurements which are taken at 2m off the ground, and sea surface temperature measurements which are taken from, well, the surface waters of the sea. However, most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. The actual sea surface temperature warms at a slightly lower rate than the air above it in climate models, so this apples to oranges comaprison makes it look like the models are running too hot compared to observations than they actually are. This gets further complicated when dealing with the way the temperature at the sea ice-ocean boundaries are treated, as these change over time. All of this is detailed in greater length in Kevin's backgrounder and of course in the paper itself. 

The upshot of our paper is that climate models and observations are in better agreement than some recent comparisons have made it seem, and we are basically warming inline with model expectations when we also consider differences in the modeled and realized forcings and internal climate variability (e.g. [Schmidt et al. 2014](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150000726.pdf)).
