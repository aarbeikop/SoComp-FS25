Has this ever actually happened?  I'm aware that some short term climate change has been driven by volcanoes - and at the other end of the scale, so geological processes have gradually absorbed the CO2 from the atmosphere and gradually driven down climate - over millions of years.  But the climate change from say, Pinatubo or similar gigantic eruptions was due to particulates, not CO2, and thus lasted only a short time.

Hmmm you will find the remnants of ocean floor in mountain tops. This is from geological uplift (orogeny). But that does not demonstrate sea level rise. Especially current one. 

We can see this directly from satellite data.

They're already used to dealing with sea level rises.    The same with the [Thames River barrier](https://21stcenturychallenges.org/the-thames-barrier/)...it's brilliant, but likely won't be able to compensate over the next 100 years.  Miami's biggest immediate problem probably isn't water level but [access to drinking water](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-29/miami-s-other-water-problem).  There's been an interesting [experiment going on for a few years in Lousiana](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/01/how-to-save-a-town-from-rising-waters/547646/) about how to move people inland, but it's not working well so far.  New York probably doesn't have the infrastructure funding to deal with sea level rises on top of already existing tunnel issues. 

You can see a few fictional models of how it might work- Kim Stanley Robinson's an optimist to say the least, and his book [New York 2140](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29570143-new-york-2140) imagines a New York City that's mostly underwater. His [Science in the Capital series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49129-science-in-the-capital) imagines Washington underwater after a major flood, and it's very positive.

I'm Canadian and a lot of my relatives live on the East Coast- Canada is theoretically a leader in climate change compared to the States, and we're still really doing sweet nothings for people in low-lying coastal areas.  I'm not sure that anything can really be done to make a lot of coastal areas habitable as quickly as needed- at least in North America, if the ice shelf goes, our Eastern neighbours will likely have to move inland as quickly as possible. Neither Canada or the U.S. is even vaguely prepared for the influx of climate refugees from other provinces/states.

Coastal wetlands and mangroves are another option to help protect coastal areas from coastal erosion during storms, which will worsen as sea levels rise. This won't help to avoid innundation though.

We will adapt and sea level rise is not even a minor problem.

I would bet money that not a single coastal city on earth, with a population over 500k, has a natural coastline.  Erosion is a huge problem and a single tropical storm can significantly move an entire country's coastline in a single night.  Left to its own, most beach lines would be completely changed in like 10 years or less.

There is an entire global industry that does nothing but ""beach nourishment"" on a continuous basis. Link below is for Australia's gold coast system.

"ef9m7lb","t3_akm7a1","akm7a1","climatechange","action-oriented","I often use the event in  New Orleans and the hurricane Katrina to illustrate, that even moderate sea level rise can and will become a problem. My estimation of sea level rise til the end of the century is something around 3 feet or so - which does not sound really much. During nice weather this will probably not be a big deal. But just imagine the catastrophy caused by Katrina at just 1 foot higher basic sea level. I estimate the death toll and economical damage could easily have been two times as severe. So yes, this is a serious issue. 

&#x200B;

Ultimately we can only apply adapted solutions. Like investing insanely big amounts of money to rescue our most valuable cities, like New York City, but completely giving up less relevant cities and between both possibilities a whole spectrum. 

&#x200B;

Best would be to take the costs of such things into consideration, when still supporting ""cheap energy"", like burning coal in coal power plants. 

&#x200B;

I am not even against all burning of coal. I live in Germany and in my city of Mannheim we have a pretty new coal power plant that has a bit reduced CO2 emissions, but that alone would not make it viable. However it uses all ""waste"" heat to heat the whole city during winter season, so lots of burning of oil for heating homes is avoided. I estimate that this can even reduce CO2 emissions .

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I guess that this coal power station also runs during the summer, which is not good for the climate. But in the near future this could change and as long as such combined heat/electricity coal power plants only run during the winter and when heating the homes in a city, this could still be viable. But all other burning of coal for electricity should be banned. It annoys me a lot, that we turned off almost all nuclear plants in Germany and still run lignite (brown coal) power stations that heat no homes at all, but only the environment. 

&#x200B;

I am absolutely no fan of nuclear power at all. But our nuclear power plants were already there, running, so I would have prefered turning off the lignite power stations first, nuclear power stations later. But my fellow German citizens who did not care enough about the dangers of nuclear power after the Chernobyl disaster turned completely phobic after Fukushima. Which appears really weird to me. For the Japanese of course this is a different issue. ","2019-01-29 15:20:20","1","[deleted]","1747879090.4238641","sea level projections","manual"

It suggests that our current economic/political systems need to change radically as a result of climate change. This is something that is getting little attention, with many people believing that we can make changes to our current nation-state system rather than considering that we may need to change the basis of our economic, social and political systems if we are to survive. 

In any case, the best luck with you efforts. Please keep me posted. If you do decide to create a YouTube channel, I has some experience with video production, so may be able to help.","2019-01-01 20:03:47","2","Ink12342","1747879757.3381267","sea level projections","manual"
