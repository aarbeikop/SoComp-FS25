"32ww7t","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I’m Prof. Thomas Malone, from the MIT Climate CoLab, a crowdsourcing platform to develop solutions to climate change, part of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. AMA!","If there ever was a problem that’s hard to solve, it’s climate change. But we now have a new, and potentially more effective, way of solving complex global challenges: online crowdsourcing. 


In our work at the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, we’re exploring the potential of crowdsourcing to help solve the world’s most difficult societal problems, starting with climate change. We’ve created the Climate CoLab, an on-line platform where experts and non-experts from around the world collaborate on developing and evaluating proposals for what to do about global climate change. 


In the same way that reddit opened up the process of headlining news, the Climate CoLab opens up the elite conference rooms and meeting halls where climate strategies are developed today. We’ve broken down the complex problem of climate change into a series of focused sub-problems, and invite anyone in the world to submit ideas and get feedback from a global community of over 34,000 people, which includes many world-renowned experts.  We recently also launched a new initiative where members can build climate action plans on the regional (US, EU, India, China, etc.) and global levels. 


Prof. Thomas W. Malone: I am the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  I have spent most of my career working on the question of how new information technologies enable people to work together in new ways.  After I published a book on this topic in 2004 called The Future of Work, I decided that I wanted to focus on what was coming next—what was just over the horizon from the things I talked about in my book.  And I thought the best way to do that was to think about how to connect people and computers so that—collectively—they could act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has ever done before.  I thought the best term for this was “collective intelligence,” and in 2006 we started the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  One of the first projects we started in the new center was what we now call the Climate CoLab.  It’s come a long way since then!


Laur Fisher:  I am the project manager of the Climate CoLab and lead the diverse and talented team of staff and volunteers to fulfill the mission of the project. I joined the Climate CoLab in May 2013, when the platform had just under 5,000 members.  Before this, I have worked for a number of non-profits and start-ups focused on sustainability, in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and the U.S.  What inspires me the most about the Climate CoLab is that it’s future-oriented and allows for a positive conversation about what we can do about climate change, with the physical, political, social and economic circumstances that we have.

As the world continues to experience higher temperatures leading to greater thermal expansion and ice melt, future sea level predictions are troubling. In 2007, the IPCC estimated sea levels will rise between seven and twenty-three inches this century, creating ""worsen[ed] coastal flooding and erosion during storm surges."" This prediction is likely inaccurate, however, considering sea levels rose at a rate sixty-percent faster than the IPCC's projected rate for 1993 to 2011. Environmentalists look at this excessively low past prediction and infer ""that IPCC sea-level projections for the future may also be biased low."" Although many environmentalists stress this IPCC projection is low, some courts and agencies remain unwilling to recognize the excessive dangers of any sea level rise higher than the IPCC's projection. In Ballona Wetlands Land Trust v. City of Los Angeles, Ballona Wetlands Land Trust (Trust) challenged a revised environmental impact report for a proposed coastal project. The Trust cautioned against taking on projects in coastal areas, citing a paper by the California Climate Change Center that noted the risks of such projects to inhabitants of coastal areas. Entitled ""The Impacts of Sea-Level Rise on the California Coast,"" the paper warned developers of the risks of ""a significant sea level rise . .. as a result of global climate change."" In response, the City of Los Angeles stated that the paper's sea level projection ""represented an extreme worst case scenario, relied on a faulty methodology, and overstated the flood risk."" Providing a report from an engineer rather than an environmentalist, the city claimed that the IPCC's significantly lower projection provided a ""more reliable estimate of sea level rise,"" than the Trust's projection. Finding for the city, the court concluded that the IPCC projections provided an adequate estimate of sea level rise for the environmental impact report and subsequently permitted the coastal development. Other courts faced with the issue of rising sea levels should recognize, contrary to the result in Ballona, that the IPCC's prediction for the coming century may be excessively low because it does not factor in a possible ice melt acceleration. The general opinion of environmentalists is that sea level rise over the next century is going to be far worse than indicated by the IPCC's projections. The IPCC's excessively conservative projections pose serious implications for coastal areas around the United States where water levels are increasing at rates higher than the global average. Without accurately estimating the actual figures for potential sea level increases, these areas will be unprepared for the imminent danger that lies ahead...

...Although the government is aware of the threats of rising sea levels, including the potential destruction of cities such as New York City, New Orleans, and Miami, it is doing little to respond to these risks. Instead of working to minimize coastal cities' exposure to rising sea levels, ""government policies are encouraging development in the areas most vulnerable to sea-level rise."" In Miami, Florida's government is ""racing to subsidize new developments along the coast, through state-run insurance and funding for coastal protection,"" while nationwide, the federal government is ""encouraging construction on coastal property that's most at risk from sea-level rise."" As illustrated by Chief Justice Roberts' dissent in Massachusetts, some government officials are still unwilling to acknowledge that sea level rise causes particularly significant and concerning coastland loss. Although Congress recognizes the need to prepare for sea level rise, it provides little guidance on how this should be done. By not fully combating the effects of rising sea levels, the government is creating problems for itself both in the way of regulatory takings claims, and ultimately, the destruction of valuable coastal communities... - [Link](http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1352&amp;context=elj)","2015-04-09 03:34:27","8","0","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/31yhy4/predictions_for_the_future_a_grim_outlook_excerpt/","True","xrm67","1747839210.8072577","sea level projections","manual"
