Ask us anything!","Hi Reddit! Permafrost coasts are incredibly dynamic, and highly vulnerable to climate change. Across the ice rich coasts of the western Canadian Arctic, erosion rates have increased by 20 to 200% since the year 2000, with some coasts now retreating at over 50m per year. The erosional mechanisms here are complex and diverse, with a range of often spectacular failure types, from [huge collapsing blocks]( https://i.imgur.com/WUpQ8pv.jpg) to [massive thaw slumps.](https://i.imgur.com/JPPY97O.jpg) As well as causing rapid changes on land, the increased erosion rate over recent decades is substantially increasing the volume of sediment, nutrients and organic carbon exported to the marine eco-system on an annual basis, with knock on impacts on fisheries, carbon balance and more. To better understand the processes governing the increased erosion and to more accurately assess coastal retreat rates, we’re currently using a range of new and novel technologies, from drones and laser scanning, to long-tern time-lapse photography and thermal imaging [even along large stretches using helicopters!]( https://i.imgur.com/UehI4G9.jpg).

We have a great group here, listed below, ready to answer your questions, and a few others that will chime in too!


**Dustin Whalen**: I’m a coastal scientist with Natural Resources Canada. I’ve been studying coastal and nearshore process in the Beaufort sea for the last decade. In that time, I’ve conducted over 30 field programs in the region over the spring, summer and winter, with particular focus on coastal erosion, nearshore sediment dynamics and sea ice break-up.

**Mike Lim**: I’m a senior lecturer in civil engineering from Northumbria University with research interests in coastal geomorphology and slope processes. I’ve previously been engaged in monitoring of coastal dynamics in Svalbard using 3D change detection and thermal characterisation of cliffs.


**Samuel Hayes**: I’m PhD student from Northumbria University studying Arctic coastal erosion. This is my first trip to the Arctic, where my activities have ranged from spending hours digging holes for passive seismic surveys to collecting thermal imagery of permafrost cliffs from helicopter!


**Roger Macleod**: I’m a remote sensing and geomatics specialist with Geological Survey of Canada. I apply new geomatics technologies, from satellite imagery to drones, to improving our understanding of coastal dynamics in the western Canadian Arctic.


**Andrew Gordon**: I’m a technician from the Aurora Research Institute, I have lived here my whole life. I’m an Inuvialuit and a whale hunter.

**Scott Dallimore**: I'm a permafrost scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada. On this project, I'm looking at near shore permafrost degradation.


A special thanks must go to [NERC](http://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx) and [INTERACT](http://www.eu-interact.org/) for providing much of the funding for this research.


We'll be back around 8 pm EST to answer your questions. Ask us anything about Arctic coastal and near-shore change, conducting field campaigns, life in the Arctic, whale hunting or anything else related, AUA!

[Hard at work answering your questions!](https://i.imgur.com/2Kcx77r.jpg)


**EDIT**: Thanks for the questions everyone. We're going to take a break for the night, will try to answer a few more questions over the next day or so.

"6rboxv","collapse","skeptical","Collapse 2025","Notice how all the gloomin’doom scenarios say “by 2100”? This is done to pacify the mob for security reasons. Substitute 2050 for 2100 whenever reading those projections, and you’ll be far closer to reality. My collapse year is 2025-2030, and maybe sooner.

People like to think they’re above average, they are, but each in their own way.  The world is too complex for the average above average Joe. All these 2100 climate projections assume no war or economic disaster. Yet automation and hyper wealth concentration will steal 50% of our jobs and money in 20 years. There’s a war going on, the war for your jobs. That war will be here in 10 years. Do you think climate scientists put that in their models?

When climate scientists quote studies saying crops will drop 20% by 2100, they assume a predefined state of parameters, meaning they ignore war and economic disasters. Call it just plain ol’ reality. The reason they repeat numbers like 2° C is because reality is far worse.

The reason media propaganda has overwhelmed reality is because we are in collapse right now. The more absurd the media, the further along we are in collapse. The media has become a parody of that last Iraqi media general repeating the bravado as his country fell.

The last El Nino has kicked climate change into overdrive as earth reacts to a new energy balance. The oceans absorb 94% of the heat earth has to deal with. That’s so much fucking heat it accounts for a full 50% of sea level rise. Melting glaciers account for the other 50%. Moisture in the air is increasing dramatically and will cause huge storms on rising seas as continental interiors burn and flood. Severe climate change will hit the interior 20 years ahead of the most other regions. The troposphere is warming, the stratosphere is cooling. This extreme contrast will cause massive ozone destruction over the north pole. In February 2011, the north pole lost 25% of its ozone in one month. Our EV green energy fantasy is a joke, not a good one.

The confluence of increased food demand and extreme weather will wreak havoc on food, and ground water tables, as is happening now. The increasing toxicity of herbicides and pesticides is spreading uncontrollably across the west. How many studies do you think take stuff like poisoning ourselves into account?

We’ve forgotten how important food is.

We’ve also forgotten how important water is.

We are totally unprepared and in denial including myself and you.

The war is here, we just won’t believe it.","2017-08-03 11:39:59","39","59","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/6rboxv/collapse_2025/","True","_Lokis_Revenge_","1747864012.7193298","sea level projections","manual"
