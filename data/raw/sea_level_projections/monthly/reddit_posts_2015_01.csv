Projections by leading climate scientists of rising sea levels, heatwaves, floods and droughts linked to global warming are likely to oblige millions of people to move out of harm’s way, with some never able to return.","2015-01-08 19:16:50","3","3","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/2rrsoi/prepare_for_rising_migration_driven_by_climate/","True","Capn_Underpants","1747836074.0599012","sea level projections","manual"
"2smkn8","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I'm Julien Cobert, Internal Medicine resident physician at UPenn. I research acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common deadly illness often seen in the intensive care unit.","I'm an internal medicine resident at UPenn, trained in med school at Duke with clinical research in lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia out of Massachusetts General Hospital. I received a grant through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to work at MGH on immune cell maturation and its role in acute myeloid leukemia.  I will be extending my training into anesthesiology and critical care after my Internal Medicine residency and now utilizing my oncology and immune system research to look at critical illness and lung disease.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first defined by Ashbaugh et al in 1967 as a syndrome caused by an underlying disease process that results in:

1) new changes in the lungs on chest x-ray or CT scan 

2) low oxygen levels and increased work of breathing

3) a flood of immune cells, edema (fluid) and protein into the lungs

Some important points about ARDS:

ARDS is very common, occurring in 125,000-200,000 people per year in the United States.


Mortality rate is ~25-40% (roughly 75,000-125,000 per year in the USA)
An illness seen in the intensive care unit (ICU) where the sickest patients are cared for in the hospital.  Notoriously difficult to treat, particularly when there are many other complicating medical problems in the patient

I am still crowdfunding for my research on acute respiratory distress syndrome. Please consider backing my project here: http://experiment.com/ards
