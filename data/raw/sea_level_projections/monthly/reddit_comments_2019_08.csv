2nd, in effect, it's already happening on global scale, at very least unintentionally. The effect of global dimming is well known, undeniable, measurable, and exists for decades. Those politicians' debate is merely a cover op (whether they themselves are aware about it - is anyone's guess, but in the end does not matter). The only possible debate is whether to increase intensity of existing global dimming, or keep it as it is. It can't be removed even if desired. Reduced somewhat - yes, but not removed entirely. It will clear up only few years after collapse, once global industrial system stops.

It's just whether this postponing is more good or bad - is not possible to know at this point: having more time before collapse allows better preparation for it, thus better survival after it; while in the same time, postponing it increases its severity, as every year of ""business as usual"" adds extra emissions, pollution and damages, thus leading to worse survival after collapse happens.

Some form of solar radiation geoengineering is now required. We are currently coasting on significant cooling from the aerosol effect that all our lovely CO2 producing activities produce. If we suddenly cut that aerosol effect to zero, we get fried.

The sensible (which is why I'm fairly sure it won't happen) thing to do, is engineer low CO2 cost methods of continuing the global warming reduction we currently already have while we make big reductions in the CO2 producing activities that also produce the aerosol effect we are now relying on.

But. Like you. I think once the idea of producing a solar radiation reduction method sets in, the impulse will be to produce more aerosol effect than we currently have and simply mask the fact we are doing literally nothing to reduce our CO2 output.

One approach is a sane method of not frying ourselves while we take meaningful action. The other is a method of prolonging doing nothing until we utterly destroy ourselves a few years later instead.

EDIT: For the tinfoil hat version! Investigating solar radiation reduction measures could also just purely be for the rich / powerful elites. The world turns to shit. They retreat to bunkers. Billions die. Now you send up the high altitude balloons with dust for a few decades to reduce the heating effect when CO2 emission is roughly zero. Emerge from bunker. Win.

**Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf** 

> Abstract
> 
> This paper summarizes current understanding of the processes that determine the dynamics of the subsea permafrost–hydrate system existing in the largest, shallowest shelf in the Arctic Ocean; the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). We review key environmental factors and mechanisms that determine formation, current dynamics, and thermal state of subsea permafrost, mechanisms of its destabilization, and rates of its thawing; a full section of this paper is devoted to this topic. Another important question regards the possible existence of permafrost-related hydrates at shallow ground depth and in the shallow shelf environment. We review the history of and earlier insights about the topic followed by an extensive review of experimental work to establish the physics of shallow Arctic hydrates. We also provide a principal (simplified) scheme explaining the normal and altered dynamics of the permafrost–hydrate system as glacial–interglacial climate epochs alternate. We also review specific features of methane releases determined by the current state of the subsea-permafrost system and possible future dynamics. This review presents methane results obtained in the ESAS during two periods: 1994–2000 and 2003–2017. A final section is devoted to discussing future work that is required to achieve an improved understanding of the subject.

**Dissecting Paleoclimate Change**

*Using a core sample from the Santa Barbara Basin, UCSB researchers decipher the history of paleoclimate change with surprising results*

> “One of the most astonishing things about our results is the abruptness of the warming in sea surface temperatures,” explained co-author Kennett, a professor emeritus in UCSB’s Department of Earth Science. “Of the 13 degree Fahrenheit total change, a shift of 7 to 9 degrees occurred almost immediately right at the beginning.”
> 
> Kennett noted that this remarkable record of paleoclimate changes also raises an important question: What process can possibly push the Earth’s climate so fast from a glacial to an interglacial state? The researchers may have discovered the answer based on the core’s geochemical record: The warming associated with the major climatic shift was accompanied by simultaneous releases of methane — a potent greenhouse gas.
> 
> “This particular episode of climate change is closely associated with instability that caused the release of methane from gas hydrates at the ocean floor,” Kennett said. “These frozen forms of methane melt when temperatures rise or pressure decreases. Changes in sea level affect the stability of gas hydrates and water temperature even more so.

There are way too many variables. It would be like guessing when the next stock market collapse will happen or when to sell bitcoin (except even more complicated, as you probably know because you just listed a big chunk of the variables and all of them are pretty much unknown).

You need to take that bunch of information and group it in to ""maybe this happens next"". Cloud loss for example isn't the next worry. A shit load too many clouds is the worry before we reach that point. By the time the clouds boil off we'll pretty much all be dead anyway. (YAY!)

Heh. Your post is a first. I sort of want to say ""No it's not as bad as that!"" but it is .. except the sequence of events is ill defined and will probably take longer than you seem to think. We will get there. It will be hell on the way. But it's one step at a time. And it probably only takes fairly minor climate problems to kick us towards collapse. You don't need everything to kick in and doom us to dust before society as we know it grinds to a halt.

Activists are largely mis-lead. Sorry. My view. Some may down vote for that. But virtually all the ""green activist"" solutions you see out there are designed around making already rich corporations richer at the expense of poor people. If you look at who actually profits from the accepted main stream narratives on what we should be doing, it's probably someone like the Koch Brothers (yes someone makes money from solar panels, EV's and windfarms, and it's not that ecologically sound at the moment to be making them .. it could be .. if the entire process chain was redesigned to be CO2 neutral! But it isn't). Bottom line. If you're voting for someone to make you poorer to fix this .. then it probably won't fix this. Well ok .. I assumed you didn't already have 10 billion in the bank. For the rest of us, struggling in the 3, 4 or 5 digit range of salaries it's true.

The only solutions we have to get ahead of the curve are profoundly anti-current-capitalist. I'm sure capitalists could make money off the new ideas if we did them, but for now we are stuck with the current bunch. We need a massive change to localised food production and consumption, easily repairable white goods, a huge shift in what we subsidise (air fuel, agriculture, fracking, tax evading corporate profits) to what we actually need to support.

And... it's not happening. So yes. You have a good summary of the problems (you sort of gloss over aerosols, and that's a huge hit on the climate if we ever did cut back our current patterns). And all of them .. in one way or another .. will probably happen (and probably more that we never knew existed).

Back around the beginning of worries about climate change, the concern was voiced .. ""If you wait until you can see the changes happening, it's already too late"". And that was shot down as a pathetic way to get tax out of the public for a non existent threat. Yet here we are. We can see the changes happening, and yes, it is already too late.","2019-08-14 03:31:31","4","mogsington","1747886004.68643","sea level projections","manual"

In some ways the place is more prepared for a collapse because many people still have traditional knowledge and there are a lot of people with skills associated with living in a less developed world.  You'd have to find an area with adequate rainfall, decent elevation, and a relatively cohesive social structure, probably with one very dominant ethnic group.  If I had to pick a place in west Africa I'd go to the Fouta Djalon in Guinea.  I haven't been to Congo but I'm on the edge of the Congo basin, and all I can say is it's not densely populated which means the potential for huge conflict is small,  but the potential for minor conflict is always present.","2019-08-14 15:38:21","8","ontrack","1747886051.573937","sea level projections","manual"

Hello fascism. You’re basically advocating genocide, since there will be mass starvation, thirst, and heat death among poor countries that lack infrastructure.

But in general, I do agree that the old ecosystem must die (it’s inevitable at this point) and our only option is to replace it with a new one that suits our needs. But a big part of this will be public housing projects to meet the need of immigration, not militarizing borders.","2019-08-19 16:48:22","3","Enkidu420","1747886066.7956188","sea level projections","manual"

""Need""? Maybe. But will they be? No. 

And it is very simple to understand why. War-like effort is only possible when whole nation(s) are highly motivated to do it. Take most-known example of WW2: germans were motivated by several years of Nazi propaganda, millions believed they _need_ to go to war; soviets were motivated simply because it was literally survival for their people - they had no choice but to make that war-like effort, as otherwise most of them would be simply killed in a few years under nazi occupation, and they knew it from both nazi propaganda - and actual genocide nazis did on territories they occupied; US was only doing large-scale war effort - above and beyond the usual business-on-war, - after Pearl Harbor happened, and again with lots of propaganda involved. 

But what exactly will motivate modern citizen to do great sacrifices in their personal well-being, which are required for any kind of true war-like effort? 

If you think it's the knowledge of climate catastrophe - wake up, we here in /collapse are not mainstream. Far from. You go around and you ask people how much they are ready to sacrifice, personally, right now, in order to ""fight climate change"". Most will just tell you you're nuts. No wonder: mainstream propaganda keeps the subject ""controversial"", and for good reason - business as usual needs to proceed, and like one smart person once said, ""the world is a business""...","2019-08-19 19:39:53","2","Fins_FinsT","1747886066.7996182","sea level projections","manual"
