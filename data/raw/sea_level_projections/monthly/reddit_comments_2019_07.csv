Mitigation is about concentration, 450ppm is a fuck load better than 850ppm.

Adaption is about moving off fossil fuels so we don't get to stupid levels and recgonise what needs to be done to do that eg no more airports, moving infrasture away from sea levels and flood plains, switching to PT and bikes (escooters/pedelecs for inner city living)) and rail for intra city transport (hydrogen or electricity there), no more fucking highway upgrades, changing building codes building out wind and solar.  Hell it's it's illegal to build in Austria to meet the changing climate, as this article shows.

If this information and the reliability of so many of these resources and ecosystems was presented to mankind showing how it sustains human life it would become more important. Mankind truly destroys all it comes in contact with, it’s a sad reality, but it’s the truth. There is more potential in the world. I’ve had it told to me many times that Homo sapiens are the only species that can think about long term future gains. The example is with the study on chimpanzees, I believe. Researchers have placed food inside a basket (something a monkey would want to eat, obviously) and let the monkey try to get it out through the gaps and openings in the basket. Monkeys apparently only think of the now rather than the long term sustainability of not eating whatever’s in the basket for the sake of using your hand to its full potential.
