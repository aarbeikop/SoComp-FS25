"9mdgb6","climatechange","action-oriented","In the future, will it be possible to reverse the rising sea levels after inland flooding?","I looked this up online, but couldnt seem to find a basic theory (although i saw some mention of aerosal geo-engineering to cool off areas- but didnt quite understand it). In the future if sea levels rise, and the water floods inland, is there way to create any man made tech where we get the polar ice caps recovered/back, and then the waters would recede back again? is this even possible for us to create? Or maybe somehow the inland flood waters would evaporate from transforming into dry/arrid areas?

sorry if its a dumb question...","2018-10-08 09:43:07","9","17","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9mdgb6/in_the_future_will_it_be_possible_to_reverse_the/","True","Tyler_Lockett","1747876326.8639343","sea level projections","manual"
"9kgefn","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2018 q3","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for almost 3 years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.
