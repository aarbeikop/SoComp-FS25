It is useful but challenging as a datasource. 

Here is a visualisation of current sea level rise from tidal guages

 [https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level)

There is a difference between no sea level rise at all, and no acceleration in sea level rise. The claim that is being made by Climate Scientists, based on satellite altimetery is that the SLR of today is twice what it was 100 years ago, and 50% more than it was 30 years ago.

I've checked out the tide gauges in my area.  We have tide gauges that have been in use for the last 100 years, and are reliable.  The thing, here, is that we know that the land is sinking at a known rate.  Where I live right now is sinking more rapidly than the sea is rising.  I have a house, north of here, but by less than 50 miles, where the land is sinking at half the rate. 

Between those two areas, and several other tide gauges in a 100 mile radius of me, the sea level rise shown on the gauge, minus the rate of land sinking, is consistently under 2 mm per year, and has been for the last 100 years.  There is some noise in the signal, of course, but averaged out even a little, the rate is consistent.  There has be zero acceleration since the 1920s.  None. Zip. Nada.  

We know, for certain, that the sea level rise from the glaciation period until about 8,000 years ago was huge - more than 100 meters over a time period of maybe 7,000 years.  That's 14.3 mm per year.  After that period, there was a dramatic change to more like 2 mm per year 8000 years ago, and falling off slowly.  But, it's not been perfectly smooth. We've had warm periods and cool periods, and the cooler periods would have less SLR.  We just came out of a Little Ice Age, where the SLR is likely to have been closer to 1 mm per year, or even less, while now we're all the way up to about 1.9 mm per year, based on tide gauges. 

The difference, of course, is a combination of thermal expansion and terrestrial storage of water, often in the form of ice. While we are still in the Holocene, the ice caps and glaciers are still melting.  At some point this will turn around and they will begin growing again.

Let me say this again, a slightly different way.  Our records indicate that over the last half a dozen thousand years, the seas have risen up by several meters. Eight thousand years ago, they were around 10 to 12 meters lower than they are today.  There's really no way to escape the conclusion that the seas have not been static for most of the holocene. They have been rising.  Exactly how much is up for debate, but one simply can't plausibly say that they have been stable for the last 5000 or 10,000 years. 

So, the idea that sea levels are not rising? Your debate partner is wrong.  The idea that we are now seeing faster SLR than we did in the 1950s?  Sure, I'll buy that.  Or, even faster SLR than we did in the 1700s, during the last bits of the Little Ice Age.  We didn't have tide gauges or satellites in 1100 AD, at the top of the Medieval Warm Period, or during the Roman Warm Period, or during the Minoan Warm Period, so it's really hard to know exactly what the rates of SLR were during those times.  But!  since we've come up several meters in the last 6 thousand years or so and we probably didn't see huge rates of SLR during the Little Ice Age or the Dark Ages, we can be fairly certain that the rates of SLR during the climate optimums in the last several thousand years were at least as high as today.","2019-10-30 19:33:04","1","deck_hand","1747887496.86751","sea level projections","manual"

Changes in water and atmospheric pressure will probably be very small, so they can be ignored. 

The sea surface will indeed evaporate faster, but water doesn't stay in the atmosphere very long. This is why (despite what many climate deniers say) water vapour can't be driving climate change, even though it's a potent greenhouse gas - it doesn't hang around in the atmosphere long enough to cause long term changes. Any that falls on the land will end up in the seas pretty quickly however, unless it is in the form of snow somewhere like Antarctica. I think the amount that will fall (and stay) as snow is too small to have a noticeable effect on sea level rise however.","2019-10-17 11:53:39","2","donaldosaurus","1747887517.2421649","sea level projections","manual"

One last question. What are your thoughts on nebula genomics business model? I am skeptical that it increases donor interaction with their data, I am concerned that participants in their program can see have their data used in a predatory manner.

I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, Hypermobility type which the gene hasn’t been identified for yet. I also had 23&Me and have answered 99% of their research questions. 

While I would usually be more hesitant to share info like that, I’m also pretty desperate to find the hEDS gene. I’m hoping one day crowdsourcing will do what the traditional medical avenues haven’t. Considering how many hEDS patients there are on disability, I really think everyone would benefit from that.","2019-10-03 14:33:34","2","bendybiznatch","1747887705.2737465","sea level projections","manual"

We are living in the the age of information, where a vast ammount of our personal data is already stored in some form and, while belonging to us, can still be used by 3rd parties ( I am looking at goverments for the purpose of my question ).

What are your stances on using genetic information of individuals for advancing the human species as a whole? 

Every now and then we see some news about a person being found with ""a rare blood trait that could cure X"". Is it possible that these traits could be found sooner and in greater numbers if goverments kept this information in a similar fashion they keep personal info? 

Also, could this information be protected in the way, if not better, as the info thr goverment keeps on their residents (like SSN or info on our IDs)?

"f2aqglx","t3_dcqmq9","dcqmq9","science","scientific","Genetic end-user and computer systems administrator here.  This conversation feels very similar to to other data security and ownership discussions and is especially similar to caring for biometric data used for computer authentication.  Rather than asking the question ""Who should have access"" I think one of the questions that needs to be answered is ""Who *could* gain access?"".  You need to assume the data will be retrieved by hackers or adversarial governments via search or seizure simply because the data has value.  

If a user password is compromised its something that be be disposed of and replaced, but that concept isnt possible with biometric data.  Due to this fact, biometric login data is typically encrypted at the device level so that the platform you authenticate against does not hold and can not get the bio-data.  The fact that companies like those that provide fast airport check-in aggregate biometric data is terrifying to me.

Using this idea that the genetic data is unable to be changed by the owner and has potentially catastrophic consequences if accessed by certain sources, you simply should not hold personally identifiable genetic data in a way you can access it.  In this situation a person who does a genetic study for medical reasons should not have their data stored in a manner accessible by the study holder after the study is complete.  A separate system with fully anonymised  data could be made accessible to researchers for broad study on a patient volunteer basis.","2019-10-03 15:29:02","2","kurbycar32","1747887705.2887623","sea level projections","manual"

 The insulting breach of trust that happened with HeLa should never be repeated. 

I understand that you as individual researchers may have a moral compass regarding this but the people/companies who pay your bills certainly don't. I can just imagine someones genetic information that resulted in a multi billion dollar spin off industry getting skimmed and made anonymous 'accidentally' or the person in question gets occasionally invited to cut a ribbon somewhere and then has to go back to their slum and put a trophy of appreciation that cost six months of their rent next to a high-school bowling trophy or something.

 I want to be optimistic about this and I am excited for the future of genetic engineering and gene therapy but I feel like this will end up being a ""the meek shall inherit the earth but not its mineral rights"" kind of situation where massive multinational corporations just steam roll anyone trying to get any sort of compensation from their genetic data with lawyer team with a million dollar retainer. 

I think this is a terrible time to be an individual with unique genetic information that could be beneficial to society because the implications and practices of genetics is so far ahead of not only the general public, but the vast majority of lawmakers, that having a meaningful conversation about it is nearly impossible. Not to mention many companies who are involved in genetic research are not locked to one country and there are always hungrier economies with more lax regulations. 

In 25, 50, ? Years I think the fruits of this labor are going to be fantastic but I feel like a lot of people are going to get screwed hard in the process. It would be interesting to have a process where the intellectual property rights of an individual's genetic information are shared between the original source(person) and the discoverer for a set period of time. Although I suppose whats to stop you from just editing the gene sequence enough to make a similar but legally distinct analogue.

Ozone production/use near the surface of the earth does not affect ozone levels in the stratophere, which is what we're concerned about when we talk about he ozone layer.

Ozone is produced in the stratophere when UV rays break apart oxygen molecules and the oxygen atoms (O) then combine with oxygen molecules (O2) to form ozone (O3). The problem is that we're producing and releasing into the atmosphere chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons) which are very good at breaking down ozone, and that's a bad thing.","2019-10-01 04:55:51","3","mrrp","1747888014.2892","sea level projections","manual"
