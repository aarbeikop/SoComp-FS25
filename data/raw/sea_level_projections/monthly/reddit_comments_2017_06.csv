That is locked in, but it will only take a certain amount of more storm surge, on a too frequent basis, to fuck up infrastructure, like underground utilities, to the point where it's abandon because it costs too much. Look at Miami Beach for an example of a wealthy city throwing hundreds of millions at the problem just to buy a couple more minutes. Soon there will be a real estate rush to the exits that will almost instantly devalue hundreds of billions to a trillion dollars worth of private and municipal property. 

Here is the latest, but it's just a continuation of a string of band aids and is happening all over America and the world for those who have the resources.

**Miami Beach to begin new $100 million flood prevention project in face of sea level rise** 

""The city will embark on a $100 million project to raise roads, install pumps and water mains and redo sewer connections during the next two years across a swath of single-family homes in the La Gorce and Lakeview neighborhoods of Mid-Beach. A sizable chunk of a citywide effort estimated to cost $400 to $500 million, the work is meant to keep streets dry in the face of sea level rise.""

Most people don't seem to understand that long before they see the Hollywood disaster scenarios, civilization will be upended by the cumulative effect of AGW consequences. It's already going down everyday and getting worse by the year. Most of the infrastructure (already highly neglected in the US) was not engineered for the poundings (frequency & intensity) it is now taking and no society on earth can repair and rebuild forever. AGW will break economies even if the masters of the universe somehow mange to keep them from imploding due to debt, greed, corruption & stupidity. Sea level rise has already started it's destruction of some of the best agriculture land in the world through salt water intrusion. Again, it does not need to be permanently underwater. Frequent flooding is enough to ruin it. The list goes on and on.

Yes.

Good thing that humanity is more economically and socially divided since the Gilded Age, otherwise I might be worried.

Seriously though, people need to realize that humanity has never united against any threat, and we will continue to NOT do so. We are far too tribalistic and there are more of us than ever. All the economic and cultural elite do is divide the common people from uniting against the real threats. Bread and circuses, but today it's more like the bread and internet. 

Why worry about impending environmental catastrophe when you can look at 10/10 asses on Instagram all day and listen to FUTURE for free on Spotify? ","2017-06-29 08:52:22","1","[deleted]","1747862259.4965699","sea level projections","manual"
