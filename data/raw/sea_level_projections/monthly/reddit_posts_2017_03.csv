"62h7a7","collapse","skeptical","Overpopulation: You're not going to solve this voluntarily","The story you've heard from liberal optimists like Bill Gates is that by focusing on reducing infant mortality and sending girls to school, people would stop having children and overpopulation would sort itself out. Sounds great right? We can focus on giving everyone what they want and no tough choices will have to be made, ever. Life is little more than a giant puzzle that's solved by discovering the right technologies and being nice to other people. But unfortunately, reality intervened:

>http://www.bitsofscience.org/21st-century-forecasts-for-sea-level-rise-and-world-population-growth-7279/

>In 2002 the UN Population Division made a world population growth forecast for the year 2050 – stating (medium variant) we’d be at 8.9 billion people then. Two years later (2004) the UN said – oops – make that 9.1 billion. Then in 2006 they said hang on, 9.2 – only to revise that number upwards to 9.3 in 2010.

>And then just two years later (2012) that same UN Population Division made another forecast. The target year stayed the same – yes, 2050 – but now we were to believe world population would by that time have risen to 9.6 billion people.

>And just when you won’t believe it anymore last year, in 2015, they again upped their forecast by another 100 million people – to 9.7 billion (medium variant) for again 2050.

>The news of the day? It’s no longer 2015, but 2016 – so time for a new forecast. This time the projection does not come from the UN Population Division, but from the ‘Population Reference Bureau’ – an agency that thinks the UN has been overly optimistic still about the rate of the global population growth – and that the world population forecast for 2050 should be increased with another 200 million – to 9.9 billion in 2050 (see report – PDF).

>Now… we are almost tempted to make another chatter plot and do a regression – to predict what forecasts will be in 2 years time, 5 years time.

If the demographic transition theory was correct, you wouldn't have to raise the population projections every year, now would you?

This is something we could have predicted. Charles Galton Darwin, the grandson of Charles Darwin, warned that the ""educate reproduction out of existence"" approach would never work. From Wikipedia:

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Galton_Darwin

>On his retirement, his attention turned to issues of population, genetics and eugenics. His conclusions were pessimistic and entailed a resigned belief in an inevitable Malthusian catastrophe, as described in his 1952 book The Next Million Years. He first argued in this book that voluntary birth control (family planning) establishes a selective system that ensures its own failure. The cause is that people with the strongest instinct for wanting children will have the largest families and they will hand on the instinct to their children, while those with weaker instincts will have smaller families and will hand on that instinct to their children. In the long run society will consist mainly of people with the strongest instinct to reproduce. This would ultimately have dysgenic effects.

Or to quote Garret Hardin:

>It is a mistake to think that we can control the breeding of mankind in the long run by an appeal to conscience. Charles Galton Darwin made this point when he spoke on the centennial of the publication of his grandfather's great book. The argument is straightforward and Darwinian.

>People vary. Confronted with appeals to limit breeding, some people will undoubtedly respond to the plea more than others. Those who have more children will produce a larger fraction of the next generation than those with more susceptible consciences. The differences will be accentuated, generation by generation.

>In C. G. Darwin's words: ""It may well be that it would take hundreds of generations for the progenitive instinct to develop in this way, but if it should do so, nature would have taken her revenge, and the variety Homo contracipiens would become extinct and would be replaced by the variety Homo progenitivus. [16]

>The argument assumes that conscience or the desire for children (no matter which) is hereditary-but hereditary only in the most general formal sense. The result will be the same whether the attitude is transmitted through germ cells, or exosomatically, to use A. J. Lotka's term. (If one denies the latter possibility as well as the former, then what's the point of education?) The argument has here been stated in the context of the population problem, but it applies equally well to any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself for the general good -- by means of his conscience. To make such an appeal is to set up a selective system that works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.

This principle can be seen at work in Israel. Israel started out as a secular nationalist project but is rapidly becoming a religious Zionist state, [because Haredim have 7.7 children on average](http://www.columbia.edu/~yc2444/pages/Demographic%20Success%20of%20the%20West%20Bank%20Settlers.jpg). Trump has similarly won the American election, because of the high fertility rate of groups like the Amish.

This brings you to a conclusion that people don't want to hear, which is that some problems can not be solved voluntarily, but only through coercion.","2017-03-30 22:10:08","55","109","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/62h7a7/overpopulation_youre_not_going_to_solve_this/","True","iuseupyourusernames","1747859382.5066247","sea level projections","manual"
