Coral reefs around the world are dying with the Great Barrier Reef taking a major hit this year. Ocean acidification attacking the shells of  small plankton could cripple some of the oceans food chains. Oyster farmers in the NW US cannot start oysters in the ocean because it is too acidic already so they have to be started in tanks on land.
Northern areas are getting much less snow and for shorter periods which is changing the albedo along with the melting sea ice.

Still with all this information about half the population still does not understand what is coming down the pipe and how quickly.

Climate change videos on YouTube don't have many visits but Katy Perry videos get 1.3 billion views. I can't believe how many of my friends still just don't get it at all.

Soldiers fought and died for our freedom in WW2 in horrid conditions. Our generation won't even look at climate change information. It's not that we tried and failed - most people were too weak to look or too stupid to listen.

If we are seeing this much change now with a with 1 degree change I feel so sorry for young people as large feed backs such as the loss of the reflective ice and snow in the north and Arctic will continue to ramp up, and as the article states the warming is accelerating quickly.

"d1mfvqd","t3_4cyian","4cyian","collapse","skeptical","When it comes to climate change, it seems to me that there's the stuff we pretty much know or can guess at, that we base our projections on, and there's the stuff we don't know.  The problem is that the stuff we don't know is more likely to be bad news than good news.  Sort of like, if your car is starting to have a lot of mechanical problems due to being poorly maintained or old, and you do a full inspection on it, you're more likely to add more problems to the list than take problems off it.  

We're starting from a standpoint of ""the earth before our meddling is perfect because it's the environment we evolved to survive in, and anything we do to change it is probably bad."" Just like ""the car from the factory is in ideal condition and anything we inadvertently do to it is probably bad.""

Therefor, since there's still a lot we don't know about climate change, we can pretty much assume that ""it's worse than current projections based on established science would lead us to believe.""

Of course, there is the possibility of discovering good news, but on the whole, as we add things to the list of ""things we now know that we have done to the world"" it just seems logical that most will be negative changes rather than inadvertently making the world *more* like the ideal condition we started off with.  Does that make sense to anyone else?  It's sort of how I have started viewing environmental science.","2016-04-01 23:53:35","25","8footpenguin","1747849502.4952614","sea level projections","manual"

Attempts at geo-engineering projects are going have a lot of unintended, possibly **entirely negative or worsening** consequences - including projects that show initial early promise, but swing things in the wrong direction a few decades later (just think of how global dimming from pollution is actually keeping temperature rises down right now). Once such projects are announced, every company will want to profit off of the cash being tossed at ""saving the planet"". But funding and resources earmarked for such misaligned efforts would necessarily starve other less-popular proposals that may stand a better chance of actually working.

Just look at China's attempts at afforestation to combat desertification. This paper has page after page that reveal decades of work to combat desertification through planting forests has led to unintended consequences: unsuitable tree species planted, depleted water tables, erosion, a low survival rate, reduced biodiversity, and in some cases further desertification - but China's Bureau of Forestry has a vested interest in keeping their budget and personnel:

"d1mm6us","t3_4cyian","4cyian","collapse","skeptical","We must change our current lifestyles. We need to develop alternatives to eating meat. I now consume bean burgers instead of meat burgers. We need to use aquaculture, hydroponics, and aeroponics to grow food indoors with highly efficient led lights which uses 90% less water. Lets turn the rust belt into a new network of indoor farms. We need to replace all coal plants with renewables. We need a new era of nuclear power sources that are much safer, like thorium. We need to move to cities and tear down suburbs replacing them with forests. We must consider different kinds of geoengineering. We have to paint every roof top white.

It seems the only solution is to starve the 3rd world of energy so they don't start polluting on 1st world levels, stop *socialist* China from modernization, and jack up the cost of fossil fuels so much that no one can afford them. So what if supply chains break down and millions starve. Overpopulation is a huge problem too! 

Sorry, but if fixing the climate takes great EVIL than we don't fix it. We adapt like humans to our changing environment. If you want to really worry about the collapse of society, look into economic inflation and nuclear proliferation. These are present and direct threats, now.
