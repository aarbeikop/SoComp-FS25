"4z4co3","environment","emotional","Environmental theme of Rio Olympics with colors, curves and coolness","It may not have had the power and glamor of Beijing 2008 or the sophisticated elegance of London 2012. But Rio de Janeiro showed that low budget could be high impact as it delivered an Olympic opening ceremony that will long be remembered for its color, imagination, passion and profound message of hope.

Some 21 million US dollars were spent on the four-hour extravaganza at the Maracana stadium, about half London's outlay four years ago. During the week the show's executive producer, Marco Balich, said the figure was irrelevant, vowing the creativity of his production team would ensure Rio's curtain-raiser was the ""coolest"" in history. The 54-year-old Italian, participating in his 17th Olympic opening and closing ceremony, was as good as his word.

The ceremony began with a two-minute video showing how sports are an integral part of Rio's lifestyle, where nature and urban life coexist in harmony. The video was accompanied by the song ""Aquele Abraco"", That Hug, composed bossa nova legend Gilberto Gil. The song, performed here by Luiz Melodia, was seen as a symbol of the struggle against Brazil's military dictatorship.

The focus then turned to the center of the stadium where silver-clad performers reproduced a pattern created by Athos Bulcao, whose work is widely seen to reflect the founding elements of Brazil's culture, with its African and Portuguese roots. Giant waves were created by the movement of some 250 metallic sheets along with the music Samba de Verao, or Summer Samba.

It was followed by a countdown in which the squares were inflated by their own movement. The sheets turned into giant cushions, which percussionists hit to perform a drumming ""batucada"". In the center of the stage a design of a tree was raised, symbolizing peace with the earth.

The main element used in the segment was the Abrigo, developed by Rio artist Franklin Cassaro. The ""peace with the planet"" symbol was designed by cartoonist and writer Ziraldo.

The next section was dedicated to the Amazon region, home to the world's largest rainforest. Producers recreated the ""birth of life"" with a three-dimensional projection of micro-organisms that moved frenetically and divided among themselves. Microbes, represented by large kinetic sculptures, fluttered across the stage. Then a giant forest filled the center of the stadium.

Two indigenous groups, interpreted by Parintins Festival dancers, emerged from the converged shadow of yellow butterflies. The groups recreated patterns of their art, performing their native dances while holding elastic bands that formed giant huts, known as ocas.

Rio de Janeiro is a city of more than 1,000 favelas - communities where much of the country's rhythms and dances originate. Funk artist Ludmilla delighted the audience with her rendition of ""Rap da Felicidade"", an anthem in Rio's favelas, while a boy danced.

Elza Soares then performed Canto de Ossanha, a song which played a major role in helping Afro-Brazilian music break into the mainstream. The segment was completed by Zeca Pagodinho and Marcelo D2, contemporary Rio artists that have created their own styles by fusing samba, pop, pagode and hip hop.

Credited with empowering black women, Brazilian rappers Karol Conka and MC Sofia sung while a dancer performed a combination of break dance with capoeira. MC Sofia, who is only 12 years old, showed all the makings of a global pop star with her confident and compelling on-stage presence. ""Look and listen to this black girl. Focus only on the empowerment, respect our fight and our movement,"" she sang.

The stage was then swamped by Maracutu and Bate Bola dancers. In a warning about the danger of intolerance, a battle broke out between the two groups that convulsed the stadium. The energy and tension of the artists portrayed disputes throughout Brazil and the world that are yet to be resolved.

Actress Regina Case brought the crowd to its feet by dancing to Pais Tropical while Jorge Ben Jor played the guitar. Their performance was followed by choreographies from a typical Madureira Baile Charme, or soul ball, featuring some 1,500 dancers. The upbeat segment ended with a short fireworks display.

The next part of the ceremony was a reminder of the fraught impact of climate change. Screens with Nasa-type data showed the spread of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, climbing temperatures, melting ice caps and rising sea levels. Meanwhile a boy tried to find a way out of maze of buildings in a dry, treeless landscape.

The sombre scenes were followed by a message of hope as the boy spotted a plant emerge from the arid ground. Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem, A Flor e a Nausea, was read by Fernando Montenegro and Judi Dench, its verses providing hope the planet can be saved. ""Stop business,"" the poem said. ""A flower has sprouted in the street."" Meanwhile screens showed the benefits of planting new trees and told us that Brazil has reduced deforestation in the Amazon by 80% since 2005.

In an Olympics first, athletes participated in the opening ceremony's creative program by receiving a seed and a cartridge with soil. The 11,000 seeds will be planted in Radical Park at Rio's Deodoro Olympic site, forming the Athletes' Forest. There will be 207 species of Brazilian trees with a different one for each Olympic nation.

Rio Olympics seeks to embody green, environmentally friendly and low carbon life. According to some reports, Rio used HHO Carbon Clean Machine to reduce emissions and protect the environment.

"4xz8gv","collapse","skeptical","climate sensitivity and mass extinction.","so looking at this graph, which i hope you've seen by now: http://next.greenacton.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Volstok.png

it would seem to imply that the earth is in for an ultimate rise of at least a guestimated 10C, and that's if we stopped polluting *now* (and not taking into account CO2e). if humanity keeps on much longer in it's path, that's going to easily double. or do we have some way to know that CO2 forcing doesn't stack linearly like that? that each 100ppm doesn't cause 10C of warming in the homeostatic equilibrium state of the earth? seems unlikely to me. 

___________________________

EDIT: that is antarctic ice temperate, not global temperature. this means we should expect 10C at the poles (3-4C globally) for 100ppm increase, which in accordance with data for a thermal maximum 3 million years ago: https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/2013/12/03/what-does-400-ppm-look-like/

> The Pliocene is the geologic era between five million and three million years ago

> Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4C  higher than today’s and as much as 10C warmer at the poles. Sea level ranged between five and 40 meters higher than today.

_____________________________

the only super-arching question that remains to me is how fast it's going to take to hit that. i keep hearing estimates of 1.5-3C by 2100, but i fail to see how they know that. if they are projecting simply along how CO2/temperature has already risen, i feel that could be a mistake. CO2 (and other green house gasses) simply set the input rate of heat to temperature increase. the time to CO2 increase and time to temperature increase are probably not precisely correlated, because it's not CO2 limiting how faster temperature increases, once in the atmosphere it's just present and accounted for in the thermal insulation of earth. it's other things on earth that need to heat up to maintain the higher air temperatures. it's the oceans that need time to heat up. and the land, maybe, i'm not sure if that's a significant head sink? and the ice that needs to time to melt, shoot once all the non-polar glaciers are melted, what's going to stop temperatures from rising just that much faster in those regions? *what's stopping it from rising really fast right now? what is taking time to heat?*

... freaking chaos man. I do not trust numerically computed projections of chaotic systems, miss a couple details and those whole thing could just be completely wrong. seriously. question: do error bounds even exist when trying to model chaotic systems? and how would you know them? brute force search of all the inputs to the model? as a something who's given thought to the decidability of a problem, this sounds to me like that might be uncomputable. lol. how ironic that would be ... *we can't compute the errors bounds on climate models.*

i feel like i'm looking directly at the precursor to a mass extinction event, of at least 10C, which would put us on the order of end-Permian Triassic, and fail to see how this *isn't* going to complete within my lifetime. the heat input rate is *already* there, but what is the trigger for the sharp rise that shifts climate too fast for ecosystems to catch up? or has it already happened?

see, the thing about mass extinction, is it's not the temperature rise itself that causes extinction, it's how *quickly* it rises, causing climate zone to shift faster that species can keep up ... which is already happening:

https://robertscribbler.com/2016/08/04/its-not-just-subtropical-cornwall-climate-zones-everywhere-are-on-the-march-poleward/

> At an average decadal march away from the Equator of about **35 miles,** *these respective climate boundaries* have moved by around 140 miles over the last four decades

> Movement of these climate zones is driven by a rate of global warming in the range 0.15 to 0.20 degrees C every ten years, a pace of warming about 30 times faster than the warming at the end of the last ice age. As a result, plants and animals are finding that the habitats to which they’ve adapted are swiftly and dramatically changing

>  *Plant and animal ranges* have moved behind these climate zones at a rate of only about **four miles** every decade. Basically, habitats are moving too quickly for the creatures they support to catch up.

basically, the quality of climate change that prevents mass extinction from happening is *slow shifts* in climate. we're already shifting it what looks like to be ~10x faster that what plants/animals could do to keep up. heck, we probably won't need that full 8-10C to cause mass extinction, we might be shifting it fast enough with just 2-3C that the environment is already *completely* boned. and there is zero hope of this really slowing anytime soon, these are decadal averages, it's probably worse this year given the extreme rise in temperature we're currently experiencing. and since 2000, CO2 output doubled from like 1.5ppm to what looks like 3 ppm. *'civilization', what a thrill this will be*.

let's not bring up the fact that humanity gimped ecosystem resilience by building towns, cities, and agriculture on 50% of the earth. many ecosystems probably have little room to shift because of human activity, and will likely just die.","2016-08-16 12:30:06","41","57","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/4xz8gv/climate_sensitivity_and_mass_extinction/","True","dart200","1747853080.6344955","sea level projections","manual"
