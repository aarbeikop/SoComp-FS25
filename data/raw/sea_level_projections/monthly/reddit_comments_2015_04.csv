Have you guys ever created a contest focused on this issue? 

It is quite a difficult issue to provide solutions to, mostly due to the massive scale that any chemical application would require, the fragility of marine ecosystems, and the various regulations that can make geoengineering the oceans a difficult task.

"cqfswk7","t3_32ww7t","32ww7t","science","scientific","Perhaps this is out of the scope of your area of focus, but I'll ask just in case you can answer this question:

In the developed world, members of the public get a lot of messages about lifestyle changes that we can make to lessen the destructive impact that our lives on the environment (e.g. recycling, buying locally grown foods, minimizing automobile usage, etc...). There doesn't seem to be a publicly understood picture of what an adequately environmentally responsible life might look like, though.

So the question is, how much is enough? What would the average lives and consumption patterns of all people need to look like in order for us to get to a sustainable state in which collectively, we are no longer pushing the world in the direction of environmental collapse?

Specifically, I lived in Berkeley, California for a short while, and my anecdotal impression was that the average person there was far more focused on living their life in an environmentally responsible manner than the average American, and often made lifestyle choices that were dramatically different from the average American out of that concern (growing much of their own food in large backyard gardens, not owning or driving cars, etc...). How close might the average Berkeley resident be to that ideal lifestyle, and how much further might we have to go?

Or, alternatively, is approaching the problem on the level of consumer choices asking the wrong question? Is it more the case that we as societies need to do the harder work of being involved on a mass level in consciously and intentionally changing some of the fundamental economic/social structures and systems that our societies are built on in order to reach an environmentally sustainable state? If so, what might that process look like, how might it gain momentum, and what might the restructured societal systems look like?","2015-04-17 19:34:01","2","Robin_Claassen","1747838840.626918","sea level projections","manual"
"cqfuxxs","t3_32ww7t","32ww7t","science","scientific","Years ago, I read an article that talked about the potential to make a huge dent in the carbon level in the atmosphere by changing around the practices of large scale farming.  The idea was that major agriculture sucks out a huge amount of carbon into plants every year, but then allows it to go right back in the air after harvest (or even forces it, by burning it).

On the other hand, if all the plant matter were instead buried, it would sequester the carbon, and even could be done in a way that lowered the need for commercial fertilizers and soil improvements. 

Governments could encourage this transition by creating incentives for the new approach, and that such a system would be far cheaper than other proposed methods.

It all sounded quite compelling at the time, but I've never heard another word about it.  Googling finds a bunch of discussion about much less feasible ideas of building new types of sequestration facilities to trap gas out of the air.    Plants already do this.
