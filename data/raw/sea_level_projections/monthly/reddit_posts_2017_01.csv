"5pt6b9","sustainability","action-oriented","Looking to work in the green architecture/design field","Sorry this is so long! TL;DR: recent graduate with econ/math wanting to be in the green industry. What's the best way for me moving forward?  
Hi sustainability, I hope this is the right sub for this!  
So I graduated last spring with a double major in economics and math. I really wish I had realized when I was picking schools and programs and things that this is what I want to do for a career, but I really only realized it once I decided to write my thesis on the alternative energy industry. Since graduating, i have been contracting (min wage) in a start up software project/product development team role for 5 months and living at home. It's really great experience and I'm not trying to quit this moment, but I'm trying to make plans towards a career (and ideally move out soonish).   
My absolute dream job would be to work with a green design or architecture company. obviously at the moment I'm totally open to doing work with any firm in the sustainability field, any entry level project job on linkedin, indeed, glassdoor, monster, etc require at least a bachelor's degree in sustainability and/or architecture and I have neither of those.    
My job-hunting plan is to send my resume to jobs that I'm qualified for (and some that I'm not) and just contact a ton of people on linked in / finding the company online and asking if they would be willing to have a 15-20 min informational interview.  
I'm in the process of applying for some summer fellowships, studying for the gre, and applying to some jobs (but haven't buckled down to seriously start searching like that yet) - my question is, how feasible would it be for me to get a job in this area or do I need to put my efforts toward applying to get a degree or certification first? I want to get an MBA or masters in clean tech or sustainable design. But maybe there are other certifications that I don't know about?
