"awt89k","collapse","skeptical","What I think everyone here is missing: Carbon sequestration","I´ve been looking at the cornucopian vs neomalthusian debate for over ten years now. I´ve generally found myself on the side of the neomalthusians. Permanent growth on a finite planet is impossible. Lately, I´ve found my position growing more nuanced: Permanent economic growth may be impossible, but if you shift your resources away from one sector of the economy and into new sectors that did not previously exist, you can have something akin to economic growth, without a growth in resource consumption. Economic growth can decouple from material consumption.

The thing I´ve tended to notice over the years, is that the neomalthusians have been too pessimistic about the impact that technological innovations can have on our way of life. As an example, peak oil was supposed to occur in 2008 and the economy was supposed to enter a gentle slope downwards afterwards. What happened in reality is that there was an economic shock, but it was followed by the exploitation of unconventional oil. So far, we see no evidence that the economy is suffering from cheap oil shortages. The goalposts were then moved further, now the problem was declining EROI from these unconventional oil deposits.

Simultaneously, we saw the emergence of electric passenger vehicles. Again, there was widespread skepticism. The vehicles merely drive on electricity from coal plants, they´re subsidy dumpsters, the battery range is inadequate and can´t be improved, there´s not enough lithium in the Earth´s crust, etcetera. And yet, here we are today, in a world where passenger vehicles can travel 300 miles on a battery. The batteries have become cheaper, more efficient and allow people to travel further.

Now if I have to extrapolate from what I´ve seen so far, the same principle will apply to carbon sequestration. Ask the average Neomalthusian what will happen to these projects that sequester carbon in the rocks of Iceland or similar projects elsewhere and you´ll hear that it can´t be scaled, that it´s too expensive, that governments have no incentive to work along on it, etcetera. And yet, we´ve seen these arguments about every previous innovation that saved the day. In fact, I wasn´t around back then, but I´ḿ somewhat willing to hazard a guess and say that I would have seen the same scenario play out in the 1970´s, when optimists were pointing to rising yields and declining fertility rates, while pessimists were predicting imminent global mass starvation.

It´s true that carbon sequestration is too expensive today, but what everyone seems to be missing is that we have every reason to expect the same thing to happen that we saw in most other technological domains: Improvements in the technology itself will allow the price to come down to the point where we find ourselves able to deal with the crisis we face. Based on the decline in costs we´ve seen so far and extrapolating into the future, we would expect the technology for carbon sequestration to become viable for broad deployment [in the 2040´s](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/if-carbon-tech-follows-batterys-path-co2-capture-could-be-super-cheap-by-20).

So, there´s an argument to be made that the 2040´s will be way too late to avoid catastrophe. There are a few things that have to be noted however. To start with, it´s generally agreed that the impact of climate change will be disproportionately felt in those nations with the least economic development. In sub-Saharan Africa we can expect major problems by 2040. In Europe and North America, the scientific consensus doesn´t necessarily suggest major problems would emerge by that point in time. Hint: Guy McPherson doesn´t just find himself far outside of the consensus interpretation of the available evidence, his conclusions are simply irreconcilable with the available evidence. Sea-level rise is a process that decades to catch up with the temperature rise, agricultural yields are generally thought to increase in most developed countries as winter gets warmer.

Finally, we have to note that the impact of climate change is catastrophic, precisely because it happens to people who are isolated from the economic system around them. As a farmer in Africa you die of hunger during a drought, because you depend on animal husbandry or a narrow range of crops. You depend on your traditional method of food production, because you don´t have a bank account, because don´t have crop insurance that would allow you to buy food from the local village during a year of drought, because you didn´t receive the education that allows you to figure out which crops are drought-resistant. The lower your level of economic development, the greater your dependence on a narrow range of ecological variables. The hunter-gatherers of Papua New Guinean highlands die of hunger when the local megafauna are hunted into extinction, the Japanese cultivate seaweed in the ocean and consume fermented soybeans.

Overall, based on the evidence I have seen, my conclusion is as following: Don´t place all your bets on one outcome. I´m not in a position where I can comfortably rule out catastrophe, but based on what I read, I really don´t arrive at the conclusion prevalent here, that catastrophe is already baked into the equation.

My suggestion instead would be to live within our ecological means and to encourage other people to do the same. Don´t be a nihilist who pretends that nothing matters anymore. Live a sober life. Enjoy the little things. Nature is beautiful. You don´t need to visit a tropical beach on the other side of the world to figure that out. You´re healthier and happier if you eat less meat, the planet as a whole benefits too. Your body thrives when you ride a bicycle or walk around. You´ll save money too. You grow weak and decadent if you travel everywhere by car.

We live in a bridge period, where we have to live within our means, as we work to develop the technologies that will allow us to reverse the damage we inflicted on our surroundings. If you pretend that everything is already lost and hopeless, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Let me end with an example of what I mean. When I was a ten year old boy, I decided to become a vegetarian, when I found myself capable of comprehending the suffering necessary to put meat on the table. This was a difficult decision. Restaurants had no vegetarian options, teachers and parents suggested they could just scoop up the meat balls out of soup for me. Today it is no longer difficult. These days I experience that there are enough of us at every party, at every company, at every occasions, to require people to take us into consideration. It´s a faux pas if you don´t have vegetarian food options, supermarkets have entire vegetarian shelves, every takeaway outlet now has vegetarian options, even vegans are catered too. Some music festivals in Amsterdam now serve only vegetarian food. The world has changed in my own lifetime. The reason the world changed is because some people chose to live by example and the society around them had to adjust to it. Instead of choosing nihilism, I want to recommend to everyone: Live by example, in accordance to the values that you find important in life.","2019-03-03 11:33:36","19","29","0.66","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/awt89k/what_i_think_everyone_here_is_missing_carbon/","True","milkversussoy","1747881462.9391928","sea level projections","manual"

Imagine that the world faced a global catastrophe that would harm all living things on the planet and threaten to bring down the entire human edifice of modern civilization. Imagine that this growing threat would affect the very ability of the human species to feed and sustain itself in the not-too-distant future. Imagine a threat so powerful that its biogeochemical impacts would reverberate throughout the Earth's geologic record for millennia. Imagine that despite decades of warnings by the scientific community of this gathering threat, world leaders chose to downplay, deny, or outright ignore it in order to protect the profits of polluting industries whose money bankrolled their political careers. Then imagine a global society so ill-informed, jaded, and oblivious to these grim realities that they fell into the sway of fascist-leaning leaders who rose to power by fomenting dark undercurrents of fear, racism and xenophobia.

Of course we don't have to imagine such a nightmarish scenario because we are living it, each and every day. The power of corporate money has corrupted the body politic and its decision making process. Rampant mass consumerism has depleted the planet's natural resources and left a trail of toxic waste and environmental destruction. Reports grow [more dire](https://www.unenvironment.org/zh-hans/node/24615) by the day. Contrary to what some may have you believe, [globalization is not unwinding](https://mronline.org/2019/03/04/capitalist-globalization-is-not-unwinding-tncs-continue-to-increase-their-power-and-profits/). Transnational corporations continue to expand their power and profits at the expense of nature and the common good of humanity while western governments abdicate their responsibilities to the supposed benevolence of private capital.

The existential threat of climate change, biodiversity loss, and the multiple other catastrophes from capitalism's infinite growth Ponzi scheme are hurtling us into a barbaric future of societal breakdown in which war, rape, murder, starvation and mass extinction are the end results. Born from this colossal failure of governments to protect their citizenry from such devastation is a courageous group known as Extinction Rebellion. They see the writing on the wall and have organized in a last ditch effort to move the governments of the world to act and mitigate this unfolding disaster. I have the honor of interviewing one of the group's co-founders, Clare Farrell:

**ML**: Tell us a little about your background. How did you help establish XR? What are your goals for XR and what timeline do you have for it to produce results that would satisfy you?

**ML**: Here we are at the doorstep of modern civilization's collapse and most people are worried about their next paycheck or medical bill. We know that organized human societies, the way they are presently structured, will not survive this century with the environmental damage that has already been put into the pipeline, and we also know that a rapid drawdown and cessation of fossil fuel burning is imperative if future generations are to have any chance of survival at all. XR is a work in progress and part of your organization is made up of research groups tasked with working out such technical details. I imagine a new type of economy would be required to replace our current profit-based capitalist system which externalizes environmental and social costs while maximizing short-term gain. A lot of vested interests are preventing society from changing this system. Can you share with us any details on how our society can quickly phase out fossil fuels within the next six years?

**ML**: There are around 454 nuclear reactors around the world with several dozen more currently under construction. At least 100 U.S., European and Asian nuclear power stations are built just [a few meters above sea level](https://truthout.org/articles/what-are-coastal-nuclear-power-plants-doing-to-address-climate-threats/). With [accelerated sea level rise](http://www.johnenglander.net/sea-level-rise-blog/how-long-to-fill-a-soccer-stadium-with-water/) and stronger storms on the horizon, we should be planning right now to decommission and close down these future nuclear disasters. What is XR's stance on nuclear energy?

**ML**: What do you think of people who carry out or consider carrying out violent acts in response to inaction by governments and corporations on climate change? Do you have children? If you knew for certain your children faced a horrible death due to the inaction of such institutions, would your present-day tactics change? Have they not already condemned billions to death? Would you give up your life if it meant the end of planetary ecocide?

**ML**: Who, living today, serves as a role model and inspiration for you and in what way? Do you follow any particular philosophy in your life?

**ML**: What do you think about [geoengineering schemes](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/03/scientists-maybe-if-we-only-dim-the-sun-a-little-it-wont-backfire-horribly/) by scientists to dim the sun in order to reduce global warming and buy humanity more time to ""fix"" the problem? Proposed technology that could pull CO2 out of the atmosphere at the scale required is generally considered a [pipe dream](https://cleantechnica.com/2019/03/14/air-carbon-captures-scale-problem-1-1-astrodomes-for-a-ton-of-co2/)? Do you think our society will ever loose faith in the capacity of technology to solve are problems and if so why and when?

**ML**: One thing that struck me about another XR co-founder, Roger Hallam, was the story he told about his organic farming business which became more untenable over the years due to crop failure from increasingly unpredictable weather in Wales. His business finally went belly up and another farmer he knew commented that growing conditions had become so unpredictable that simply plunking your money down on a casino table would be a surer bet. How do you see the world feeding itself in such an uncertain future, especially when industrial monoculture is actually [increasing worldwide](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190206161446.htm)? This would be another area of interest for XR's research teams.

**ML**: What do you think of the Dark Mountain Project whose members have ""stopped believing in the stories our civilization tells itself""? What new stories should we be telling ourself in this age of ecological catastrophe?

**ML**: I understand wealthy countries have much larger carbon footprints per capita than the rest of the world due to our inherently unsustainable set of living arrangements, but the other much overlooked factor is overpopulation. We are adding roughly 90 million more people onto the planet per year, many of which are striving to attain a similar western standard of living. Is there any ethical way to control population growth or will nature be the final arbiter? What do you think is the maximum carrying capacity for the Earth's human population?

**ML**: Many mainstream scientists feel that to “work within” the system, they have to use language that politicians and other economists can understand in order to maintain credibility, i.e. the “value of ecosystem services”. Attempting to place a monetary value on every aspect of nature appears to be a major flaw of our current economic system. We threw the precautionary principle to the wind and, in the end, failed to understand that nature was priceless! Is XR a proponent of making ecocide an International crime?","2019-03-14 21:08:32","19","13","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/b15tu8/1st_draft_for_interview_with_extinction_rebellion/","True","xrm67","1747881480.6791432","sea level projections","manual"
