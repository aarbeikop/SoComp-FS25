"dzkysri","t3_8m4r6y","8m4r6y","climatechange","action-oriented","If you boil water away and the water vapor forms clouds, they would probably just rain and put the water back into the ocean =/

On the other hand, if the water vapor doesn't re-condense into clouds, then increasing the water vapor content of the atmosphere would increase greenhouse warming because water vapor is such a strong greenhouse gas.  If you add extreme quantities of water vapor to the atmosphere (as you might in order to counteract sea level rise in this way), you might even run the risk of pushing the earth into a runaway greenhouse, in which all the liquid water boils away and warming proceeds at a really alarming rate.  

Clouds are complicated and I'm not sure what their effects would be, but I certainly wouldn't assume those effects would be positive without further study.  It's an interesting question, but even leaving aside the possible costs and pollution associated with boiling the water, I don't think this idea will work.

water vapor is a greenhouse gas, global warming causing more water vapor causing more global warming is one of the major feedback loops that have been started by climate change. There is some doubt but clouds are likely to cause warming since they trap heat despite reflecting some","2018-05-27 21:49:41","1","Dazvsemir","1747871767.8003004","sea level projections","manual"
"dzqa79x","t3_8m4r6y","8m4r6y","climatechange","action-oriented","There are a few reasons why this won't work. 

1. Once you get to a certain concentration of water vapour, it just rains out of the atmosphere. The amount of water vapour held in the atmosphere is temperature dependent.
2. Water vapour is the most prolific greenhouse gas, so if it did stay in the atmosphere it would make things worse.
3. The latest research on clouds suggests that overall they tend to warm the atmosphere rather than cool it, unlike sulphur dioxide that reflects heat when it is high in the atmosphere.

However, the big plus with a hydrogen powered ship is that it wouldn't emit fewer greenhouse gases, so if they did become a reality, they would reduce greenhouse emissions \(and pollution\) from shipping.   


Just as an aside, one of the things I discovered working with climate scientists was that ocean\-going ships burn two different types of fuel \- a cleaner version with less smoke close to land and a much cheaper and dirtier version once they are in the middle of the ocean. It's yet another out of sight, out of mind bit of environmental vandalism we don't hear about. ","2018-05-28 22:04:50","1","Steerpike13","1747871767.8003004","sea level projections","manual"
