&#x200B;

You can also read his books on energy as well, but the lecture is a good summary. Smil takes a historical approach and makes a compelling case that we are far from getting off fossil fuels.

&#x200B;

Your line of reasoning reminds me a little bit of the economic fallacy where you can create economic growth by breaking windows. If you break a window, you create work for the window makers. So why not break all the windows and get the economy going? Well, because those repairs actually take up energy that could've been used elsewhere. Carbon sequestration is environmental cleanup, it's garbage collection.    Oil spills create jobs for oil spill clean up crews -- but that doesn't mean you can create a prosperous society by \*increasing\* the oil spills. Or having an economy based mostly on cleaning up oil spills.

Actually I don't say it can't be scaled or that it's too expensive, I ask CAN IT be scaled, or how much will it use - not cost, that's really not the factor, if it has to use more energy than we have or energy sources that do their own pollution, then it's a null. If it cannot be scaled, then frankly it's not going to solve anything. Perhaps one day I'll be shown a process and ask the same questions and get something positive.

Here's the thing, OP. You may be entirely correct and something in the near future (it better be soon) we'll find some ways to counter and even draw back from where we are now. But assuming that will happen and using the past in other areas to claim that technology always fixes things, that's not only hopium in its finest, but it's dangerous because it gives excuses to not be alarmed at what we're doing now...because hey, we'll fix it later. It's interesting that this is actually the same thing that Mann argued about in that one interview, except he blames those trying to raise alarms, not the ones who say that we'll figure it out. At least the alarmists are trying to get everyone's attention.

If there's no fixes, then we're just accelerating even more with a lack of concern, and we're already pushing down on the pedal.","2019-03-03 17:12:19","5","Rhaedas","1747881463.3844008","sea level projections","manual"

And then you have to store the CO2 somewhere, that doesn't leak, forever. So implicitly you don't understand the scale of the problem, or the fact that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics makes any technological ""fix"" highly inefficient and dependent on massive amounts of energy to undo the entropy we add to by dumping carbon into the air. 

It's like the tech to convert atmospheric carbon into nanofibers. Yeah it's great but it would require building enough plants to cover the Sahara desert to even to begin to make a dent in atmospheric carbon. And then you would have gigatons of carbon fiber waste to store somewhere so it didn't adversely affect the environment. 

When you actually look at the thinking behind CCCS, you quickly realize it exists to absorb valuable dollars that could be spent more effectively in other areas fighting climate change, even something far off and unlikely as fusion research. I think nuclear fusion is a more probable and realistic solution than CCCS in terms of research and development.

people new to reading about this stuff obsess about CO2.  If only we could power everything on renewables, we'd be okay.

The Green New Deal believes this.  Jay Inslee believes this.

The global economy is a giant horrific machine that shovels resources, nature, and people into its insatiable mechanical maw and shits out cheap trinkets on the other side.  It currently runs on fossil fuels.

But you say -- what if we could run the machine on good intentions instead?

Going negative carbon won't regrow the forests; it won't stop the trawlers and bring back the fish, it won't stop the spraying of pesticides, etc.

So, your point seems to be that technology (carbon capture in particular) will save us and we should not be so pessimistic. I am not going to debate that: other people can do that better. Take the time to go through the links under the Resources heading on the right-hand pane.

You also seem to believe that collapseniks are nihilists who believe that we should not try to do anything for the world since it is going to end anyway. That I can disprove: I \*walk\* to my work, recycle, eat mostly organic and very little meat or fish, I have not flown in years, I do not own a smartphone, buy second-hand as much as I can, own a Prius and have a bank account at Triodos Bank. I do not have solar panels mostly because my energy bill is so low, that it would take too long to pay them back. I ""grow my own food"" (although I am remarkably bad at it) and I spend long hours in the woods. I am a ""consuminderaar"", I gather you know what that means. I tick all the liberal/environmentalist checkboxes, and I still think that none of this matters.

I am sure many redditors on r\\collapse can paint somewhat similar pictures of themselves. Many of us used to have hope, and acted accordingly. Then we informed ourselves and got disillusioned and cynical.

To conclude, ponder on two simple facts: we have never had as much renewable energy, as many electrical cars, as many people going vegan/vegetarian as today. But CO2 emissions have never been higher.

We can not have all this people eating all this stuff, simple as that. We have only 60 years until the soils are all gone.

Each and every day we go into yet another giant experiment by adding 250.000 people to this planet. Population overshoot does not play out smooth and the overshooting species will never be in control.
As we are in overshoot we will deplete the natural world.
Maybe we could have taken one percent from mother earth each year, but we just take whatever we can.
Our overshoot is so extreme that we need this global civilization to produce and move energy around the planet to keep us alive.

How many people has been added just due to fossil fuels? How many have been added just due to agriculture, the destructive way to produce food in a way which it never was intended to be produced, which is not sustainable since it destroys soils etc?

You could give an 'imagine' example because I find it telling that there's lots of resources allocated to a potential asteroid impact (low probability, high impact) including but not limited to NASA's NEAR project while climate change (high probability, high impact) is ignored. Perhaps you could ask something along those lines. 'Why do you think decision makers are fine with spending resources and global collaboration on tracking down potentially colliding asteroids but ignoring climate change, the fact considered both threats are equally devastating for humanity and rely on a similar body of widely accepted scientific evidence?' This may be an additional question.

I would rephrase

>At what point do you think our civilization will lose faith in technology to solve all our problems?

into 'do you think our society will ever loose faith in the capacity of technology to solve are problems and if so why and when?
