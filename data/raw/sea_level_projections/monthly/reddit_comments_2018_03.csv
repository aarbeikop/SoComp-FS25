The 130cm figure appears to be the *very likely* upper bound, meaning only 5% chance of exceedance, whereas the IPCC's 98cm is a *likely* upper bound, meaning 17% chance of exceedance.

Table 12.3 says the USNCA Intermediate scenario is equivalent to the IPCC's *likely* upper bound for RCP8.5 and indicates 2100 SLR of 100cm compared to the IPCC's equivalent 98cm. Table 12.4 also says the chance of exceeding the 100cm Intermediate estimate is 17%, which is the same as the IPCC's probability of exceeding 98cm.

The difference appears to be use of research post-2013 for much better and clearer quantification of possibilities and probabilities beyond the likely.","2018-03-29 12:31:34","2","skeeezoid","1747869797.4103022","sea level projections","manual"

As the sea ice retreats and the surrounding lands lose their reflective snow this will add and equivalent of 50% of the radiative forcing increases caused by our emissions of greenhouse gases.

The program mentions other feed backs and there are many that are not in the models due to uncertainty such as

Last month, we predicted annual volume & extent for Feb 28:

Volume: 13.1✅ (ST) and 12.9❌ (LT)

Extent: 9.9✅ (ST) and 9.9–10✅ (LT)

The test of a prediction is of course whether or not it turns out correct, which means we will have to wait till the data are in. We’ll then keep tabs on which is best for predictions; volume or extent, and ST (short–term) or LT (long–term) trends. Expectations are ST will be best at next–month predictions, and LT at next year, volume over all better than extent.

Prediction for March 31st:

Volume: 13.2 (ST) and 13–13.1 (LT)

Extent: 9.9 (ST) and 9.9–10 (LT)

And LT for Dec 31 2018: 12.1–13 (volume) and 9.8–10.2 (extent)

(All numbers are of course in annual averages, as those are the only ones you can perform this sort of math on. Volume is in thousands and extent in millions, of km³ and km², respectively.)","2018-03-01 10:47:10","1","IceGoingSouth","1747870474.9985738","sea level projections","manual"
