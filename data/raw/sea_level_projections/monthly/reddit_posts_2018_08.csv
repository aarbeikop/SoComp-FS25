**Flooding Hot Spots: Why Seas Are Rising Faster on the U.S. East Coast**

> Scientists are unraveling the reasons why some parts of the world are experiencing sea level increases far beyond the global average. A prime example is the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, which has been experiencing “sunny day flooding” that had not been expected for decades.

Hi, I am a chemical engineer by trade. I worked in the oil and gas industry in Alberta for 3 years. I quit my job last December, I have been volunteering and networking with people since then to get into this field. 

What I am looking for:

Meeting 2030 emission targets for Canada. It’s a big challenge but its exciting.  It will involve everything with localization of food through urban farming, more public transit and bikes, green tech, less consumerism etc.  To achieve them, we need more social awareness and policies at city/federal level. 

What is existing:

There are few companies which are developing green technologies ( solar, wind, biomass etc) but not going mainstream. There are think tanks  which are giving good reports to governments and corporations, but the implementation of those reports not happening. I have applied to few of these companies, but no luck yet. Some universities have campus sustainability coordinators who are doing good work for the campus but scale up to rest of the city is missing. I have applied to those jobs too, no luck there too so far. 

Due to greenwashing in the media, ppl think driving electric car and recycling stuff is enough. This is harming the cause too. 

What is missing:

To achieve the 2030 emission targets, energy replacement with renewables and focus on energy efficiency is not enough.   We need to focus on energy conservation and energy regeneration. We can achieve that  by temporary degrowth of the economy( tough to convince ppl on this as they are worried about losing their current jobs) with circular economy principles. We need a critical mass of people to develop such an economy so that ppl can transition to this economy. That’s where catch 22 situation comes up. We need people to come out of fossil fuel economy to develop the green economy, which can be a big ask. 

Another important thing is this field is inter-disciplinary in nature. Urban growers, ecological economists, technologists, psychologists, artists etc need to integrate their work for sound policy development and for awareness.

Is there anyone thinking on these lines. I look forward to your feedback and open to other ideas. I am looking to colloborate with like minded people and any project suggestions will be helpful to me. Thanks a lot in advance.
