"5bugrh","climate","scientific","Has anyone invested in the market according to predicted AGW effects?","We know these impacts, sea level rise namely, that will render significant portions of cities unlivable. Has anyone made market bets in an attempt to capitalize on this? 

For ex:

1. We know the collapse of coastal housing markets will occur at some point, those people will have to move making non-coastal housing markets increase.  5-20% of the population moving in a generation would have huge impacts. 

2. 2 companies are competitors. Company A is on the coast and will have to move their factory in the next X decades, costing a fortune. Company B is far inland and won't have to. Therefore, invest in company B. Perhaps don't invest all in 1 company but make a mutual fund of companies projected to be insulated from climate change. 

Thoughts? Other examples? ","2016-11-08 17:10:22","4","3","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/5bugrh/has_anyone_invested_in_the_market_according_to/","True","CroMagnum_PI","1747855273.2895002","sea level projections","manual"
