"737klj","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: Beef without cows, sushi without fish, and milk without animals. We're cellular agriculture scientists, non-profit leaders, and entrepreneurs. AMA!","We've gathered the foremost experts in the burgeoning field of cellular agriculture to answer your questions. Although unconventional, we've chosen to include leaders from cell ag non-profits (who fund and support researchers) as well as representatives from cutting edge cell ag companies (who both do research and aim to produce commercial products).

Given the massive cultural and economic disruption potential it made sense to also include experts with a more holistic view of the field than individual researchers. So while you're encouraged to ask details on the science, feel free to also field questions about where this small, but growing industry and field of study is going as a whole.

Bios:

Andrew Stout

^(Andrew became interested in cell ag in 2011, after reading a New York Times article on Mark Post’s hamburger plans. Since then, he has worked on culturing both meat and gelatin—the former with Dr. Post in Maastricht, NL, and the latter with Geltor, a startup based in San Francisco. Andrew is currently a New Harvest fellow, pursuing a PhD in Dr. David Kaplan’s lab at Tufts University. For his research, Andrew plans to focus on scalable, scaffold-mediated muscle progenitor cell expansion. Andrew holds a BS in Materials Science from Rice University.)

&nbsp;

Erin Kim

^(Erin has been working in cellular agriculture since 2014. As Communications Director for) [^New ^Harvest](http://www.new-harvest.org)^(, Erin works directly with the New Harvest Research Fellows and provides information and updates on the progress of their cellular agriculture research to donors, industry, the media, and the public. Prior to her role at New Harvest, Erin completed a J.D. in Environmental Law and got her start in the non-profit world working in legal advocacy.)

&nbsp;

Jess Krieger

^(Jess dedicated her life to in vitro meat research in 2010 after learning about the significant contribution of animal agriculture to climate change. Jess uses a tissue engineering strategy to grow pork containing vasculature and designs bioreactor systems that can support the growth of cultured meat. She was awarded a fellowship with New Harvest to complete her research in the summer of 2017 and is pursuing a PhD in biomedical sciences at Kent State University in Ohio. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in psychology.)

&nbsp;

Liz Specht, Ph.D.
Senior Scientist, The Good Food Institute

^(Liz Specht is a Senior Scientist with the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit organization advancing plant-based and clean meat food technology. She has a bachelor’s in chemical engineering from Johns Hopkins University, a doctorate in biological sciences from UC San Diego, and postdoctoral research experience from University of Colorado. At GFI, she works with researchers, funding agencies, entrepreneurs, and venture capital firms to prioritize work that advances plant-based and clean meat research.)

&nbsp;

Saam Shahrokhi

^(Saam Shahrokhi became passionate about cellular agriculture during his first year of undergrad, when he learned about the detrimental environmental, resource management, and ethical issues associated with traditional animal agriculture. The positive implications of commercializing cellular agricultural products, particularly cultured/clean meat resonated strongly with his utilitarian, philosophical views. He studied Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at UC Berkeley, where co-founded the Cellular Agriculture Society, and he conducted breast cancer research at UCSF. Saam is now a researcher at Hampton Creek focusing on scaffolds and bioreactors for the production of clean meat.)

&nbsp;

Santiago Campuzano

^(Santiago Campuzano holds a BSc in Food science from the University of British Columbia. As a New Harvest research fellow and MSc student under Dr. Andrew Pelling, he wishes to apply his food science knowledge towards the development of plant based scaffold with meat-like characteristics.)

&nbsp;

Yuki Hanyu

^(Yuki Hanyu is the founder of Shojinmeat Project a DIY-bio cellular agriculture movement in Japan, and also the CEO of Integriculture Inc., the first startup to come out of Shojinmeat Project.
Shojinmeat Project aims to bring down the cost of cellular agriculture to the level children can try one for summer science project and make it accessible to everyone, while Integriculture Inc. works on industrial scaling.)

**Edit 3:45pm EST: Thanks so much for all of your questions! Many of our panelists are taking a break now, but we should have somewhere between 1 and 3 people coming on later to answer more questions. I'm overwhelmed by your interest and thought-provoking questions. Keep the discussion going!**

**Edit 10:35pm EST: It's been a blast. Thanks to all of our panelists, and a huge thanks to everyone who asked questions, sparked discussions, and read this thread.** We all sincerely hope there's much more to talk about in this field in the coming years. If you have an interest in cellular agriculture, on behalf of the panelists, I encourage you to stay engaged with the research (like through the new harvest donor's reports, or the good food institute newsletter), donate to non-profit research organizations, or join the field as a student researcher.

Lastly, we may have a single late night panelist answering questions before the thread is closed.","2017-09-29 12:50:05","26002","2318","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/737klj/science_ama_series_beef_without_cows_sushi/","True","Cellular_Agriculture","1747864555.6849058","sea level projections","manual"
"6xe6qq","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: Hi Reddit, this is Jerry Dickens, an oceanographer and professor at Rice University. I have been studying mud and water beneath the seafloor for over 25 years to understand topics such as the migration of natural gas, variations in sea level and past climate change. AMA!","Right now, I am at 34°26.7 south latitude and 171°20.8 east longitude, or about 400 km northwest of Auckland. Along with a large crew and international science team, I am on board the research ship JOIDES Resolution partaking in Expedition 371, a two month long mission to drill submerged portions of northern Zealandia. Per background, Zealandia is a large (~5 million km2), mostly underwater fragment of continental crust, and thus increasingly referred to as Earth’s hidden continent. From a science perspective, Zealandia provides an end-member piece of Earth’s surface in which to understand plate tectonics, particularly the initiation of subduction, the process where one plate moves beneath another. Unlike exposed regions of more familiar continents, where erosion often dominates, much of Zealandia has been accumulating sediment records at relatively shallow water depth for the last 50 or so million years. Expedition 371 is a major push by the broad science community to understand the geological history and past climate of the region. I am always happy sharing my fascination with oceanography and the evolution of our Earth. You can check out some recent articles on Zealandia as well as photographs and videos of Expedition [here](https://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/tasman_frontier_subduction_climate.html)

I’ll be back at 5PM ET today to answer your questions on all sorts of things, including Zealandia, marine mud and gas, the generation of paleoclimate records, to living and working on a drill ship for months at a time.","2017-09-01 12:26:58","149","39","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6xe6qq/science_ama_series_hi_reddit_this_is_jerry/","True","IODP","1747864630.0547965","sea level projections","manual"
