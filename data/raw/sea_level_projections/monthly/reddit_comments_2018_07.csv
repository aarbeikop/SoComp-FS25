"e1wmcxs","t3_8wfti0","8wfti0","climatechange","action-oriented","I agree, and I've thought this for years.  There is a good argument to say that the oceans are the perfect ""thermometer"" to use for a variety of reasons.  Expansion and landed ice melt (not floating ice) combine to cause the ""thermometer"" to rise.  It's been rising for over 250 years.  Any acceleration in sea level rise is an indication that we're warmer, a deceleration indicates that we're cooling back again.  If SLR stops, we've stabilized our temperature, but it would take years to be able to make that determination.

The ocean is a lagging indicator, of course, and doesn't tell us what the temperature is today. It tells us what the long term average of temperature (sometimes called climate) is doing.","2018-07-06 18:30:26","2","deck_hand","1747873404.3528943","sea level projections","manual"

"e1tg4l0","t3_8w7541","8w7541","climatechange","action-oriented","Here's the actual paper abstract:

Over the past 3.5 million years, there have been several intervals when climate conditions were warmer than during the pre-industrial Holocene. Although past intervals of warming were forced differently than future anthropogenic change, such periods can provide insights into potential future climate impacts and ecosystem feedbacks, especially over centennial-to-millennial timescales that are often not covered by climate model simulations. Our observation-based synthesis of the understanding of past intervals with temperatures within the range of projected future warming suggests that there is a low risk of runaway greenhouse gas feedbacks for global warming of no more than 2 °C. However, substantial regional environmental impacts can occur. A global average warming of 1–2 °C with strong polar amplification has, in the past, been accompanied by significant shifts in climate zones and the spatial distribution of land and ocean ecosystems. Sustained warming at this level has also led to substantial reductions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, with sea-level increases of at least several metres on millennial timescales. Comparison of palaeo observations with climate model results suggests that, due to the lack of certain feedback processes, model-based climate projections may underestimate long-term warming in response to future radiative forcing by as much as a factor of two, and thus may also underestimate centennial-to-millennial-scale sea-level rise.

"e1sr9xa","t3_8w4tvr","8w4tvr","sustainability","action-oriented","Hey Dave!!

  I’m a new sub, so this is the first one of your posts I’m reading. I read through about half of the articles before I had to take a break, so this post isn’t as much about the content, but rather the context of the post. I wanted to first say what an amazing job you’ve done collecting these sources. It is imperative that we know the information presented here, and because it’s not sexy enough to sell papers, I don’t think it gets presented often. This leads me to a couple questions.   
  
  1. How can I assist you in doing what you’re doing? I truly believe presenting facts in the face of folly is important, and if I can help, I want to. 
  
  2. How best can we share this information? Have you found a way that works best?  
   
  I hope these questions find you well, and I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks again.
