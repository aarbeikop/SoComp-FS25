Are any specific types of oceanic aerosols you've worked with correlated to a greater localized atmospheric temperature relative to their layer concentration in the atmosphere?

Beyond simple human industrial pollution (and I know it's anything but!) does the regional ground cover have a noticeable affect on the dispersion of naturally occurring aerosols?  Does it actually have an affect on industrial pollution as well?

Do you consider warming of the ocean to provide an addition of oceanic originating aerosols due to increased evaporation, or do you think that it is balanced or negated by decreasing wind (relative to lower atmospheric temperature difference) and less wave action/surface exposure?","2015-07-28 12:39:01","38","foxhunter","1747841435.1607466","sea level projections","manual"

My first question is with regard to aerosols. The leveling off in global surface air temperatures between the 40s and 70s, and the subsequent rapid acceleration, is often attributed to industrially sourced aerosol pollution and then the clean air act respectively. We are now seeing China rapidly clean up it's act and reduce pollution levels. Might we see a substantial acceleration in global temperatures rise over the next few decades as a result?

On science communication, there has probably never been as big a battle between the scientific reality and corporate interests as we see now over climate change, with many myths and anti-climate change/science propaganda so pervasive within the public debate.

"ctizjks","t3_3evxgv","3evxgv","science","scientific","I have heard before that the net effect of increased water in the atmosphere is the biggest source of uncertainty in climate models, but this is the first time I've heard that it's the relationship between clouds and aerosols. I attributed it to how much water will remain as invisible vapor versus how much will form into clouds since the former is a purely positive forcing while clouds contribute to albedo. 

Can you give us some idea of the contribution to the uncertainty of these two (amount of cloud formation versus interaction of clouds with aerosols)? I'm sure these two sources of uncertainty are related, ie because cloud seeding may reduce cloud cover, but they seem distinct enough to be separated out. I'm okay with answers in W/m^2 but degrees C by some year would obviously be more widely accessible.

What's the latest, greatest research on global albedo changes? Has net albedo changed on a global level? 

Are you optimistic about the Paris climate talks? Shouldn't we be talking about carbon budgets rather than percent cuts from/by whatever years? Regardless of what that budget might be, how do you think the remaining carbon budget should be divided? Should historical emissions play a role? Should we just divide the remainder in a per capita way?
