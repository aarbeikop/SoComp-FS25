"7bwtiz","collapse","skeptical","Plan B in case current action on climate change isn't enough","If the United States continues to only put effort into stopping climate change every other administration, possible that devastation to the biosphere will be unstoppable and irreversible, even with the majority of the world trying its best to cut emissions. If we ever get to a point where we have seemingly run out of options, I suggest doing something drastic to save some of the world's great cities - and that thing is building a massive seawall across the Strait of Gibraltar. While you might recognize this scheme from some of the many hypothetical scenarios in which the Mediterranean is drained, that would not be the intention here. Rather, the seawall would have huge tunnels bored into its base to allow the flow of water (and sea life) from the Atlantic to continue relatively undisrupted. That way,  the water levels of the Mediterranean and Black seas would not be changed, and several big cities in Europe and North Africa would be spared. The same thing could be done with the Red Sea and the Persian Hulf, albeit with much more massive seawalls. 

As a side note, this kind of project also has the benefit of providing a surface on which to pave a highway, allowing Western Europe to easily trade with northern Africa without the use of boats.
