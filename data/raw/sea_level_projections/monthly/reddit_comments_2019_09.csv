"f15t03n","t3_d7tl32","d7tl32","climatechange","action-oriented","No.  I'm not sure about the posts you saw on reddit, but the IPCC reports deal with changes through the end of this century (ie to 2100), while the figures for 5m to 15m SLR come from studies that address possible impacts for the next 200-500 years.  (For instance [this study](https://phys.org/news/2018-10-global-sea-meters.html).)

This doesn't detract from the seriousness of projected SLR by the end of the century, though.  Even with that much sea level rise, island countries like the Maldives and Seychelles may not be habitable by 2100, and coastal flooding and damage from hurricane storm surge, for instance, will be significantly more severe.","2019-09-22 23:42:21","3","janequeo","1747886419.8815534","sea level projections","manual"

If we drive down emissions a lot, impacts from climate change will be less. Also, the mechanics of glacier melt are still being figured out. 

Unfortunately, there's a lot of sea level rise already baked into the system, particularly that resulting from thermal expansion. 

The other thing that most laypeople don't recognize is that it's not about highest high tide, it's that plus storm surge that will result in catastrophic inundation.","2019-09-23 16:46:48","1","Independent_wishbone","1747886419.8915813","sea level projections","manual"
"f17m0vv","t3_d7tl32","d7tl32","climatechange","action-oriented","""This study found that during this period, global mean sea level was as high as 16.2 meters (with an uncertainty range of 5.6 to 19.2 meters) above present. This means that even if atmospheric CO2 stabilizes around current levels, the global mean sea level would still likely rise at least that high, if not higher, the scientists concluded. In fact, it is likely to rise higher because of the increase in the volume of the oceans due to rising temperature.

The Church of Gaia needs you to panic, [according to Saint Greta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjsLm5PCdVQ)... so they are just straight up lying about the predicted impacts of climate change.

There is absolutely zero realistic scenarios where we would see multiple meters of sea level rise from Co2 emissions by the end of this century. Anyone parroting that bullshit is lying to push an agenda.

Now that this rabbit hole is open... you should read about the other fantastical claims made by the church of Gaia.","2019-09-22 22:22:59","-8","FireFoxG","1747886419.8965812","sea level projections","manual"

A few more things to consider, which are impossible to predict, are the thawing out of old pathogens, the evolution of diseases, and the changing of disease vectors.

I don't know how much thinking has been done on the last two items except the spread of mosquitos, but consider how rapidly microbiotic environments are going to be evolving given the stress organisms are going to be under given the rapid changes of ecosystems. The interactions between organisms are also going to be wildly different as populations change and migrate, which suggests new disease vectors.

Could be some major black swans here.","2019-09-30 15:21:44","27","AArgot","1747887102.0294564","sea level projections","manual"

"f20q13t","t3_dbb5n2","dbb5n2","collapse","skeptical","I like it, however I would say 2 things are missing/off. You don't mention greenland at all, which will be melting at an alarming rate, esp once a BOE event occurs. This will raise the oceans faster than Antarctica will at least until Antarctica starts to really melt... which is 2050+.

India will 100% run out of water around 2025. First nation to collapse.

Also the ocreans will be 150% more acidic by 2050. This kills a lot of ocean life. Certain species are having issues today because of it. 

Also based off the data it looks like a BOE will now occur between 2025 - 2029. once this ice is gone and is unable to cool the oceans, the artic oceans will absorb the sun and heat up 80x faster.

And as a side note, everyone is worried about hard/mineral/energy resources. However i'd like to argue we will run out of food worldwide before we hit these resource limits. Aka by the time we are about to hit resource limits, we will have already lost 6.5 billion people (50% of our food will be destroyed by climate change), thus those resources will now last much longer with only a billion people on earth left. the only places left to live will be near the poles/west Antarctica. majority of all factories and enegry plants will be shutdown at this point and the aerosol dimming effect will vanish, giving us another +2c added on to our already +4c at 2050.

And war will definitely break out in Asia. I suspect will will be india and pakistan will go to war over water like you mentioned. I just think it will happen around 2030.
