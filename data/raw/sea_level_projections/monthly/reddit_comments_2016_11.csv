As I see it, the main climate-driven investment themes are:

1) Avoid all fossil fuels, which are already a drag on indexes that will only grow much worse. 

2) Urban real estate will grow more valuable as denser living becomes both more necessary and more desirable.

3) Own railroads with the least fossil fuel exposure and most intermodal potential. UP is my fave.

4) Own tech, which will only grow more important. 

5) Until we get serious about pricing or banning carbon pollution, renewable energy will continue to be undercut by fossil fuel producers eager to liquidate their assets (as Saudi Arabia now is). Avoid it, unless you're investing in a solar installation business in a hot market like Hawaii, California or New Jersey.

6) Food will grow in importance as climate events like the 2010 heat waves impact crops.","2016-11-08 23:47:40","2","Splenda","1747855273.526611","sea level projections","manual"

Domestic production will become more important than overseas as rising tides makes port facilities unusable.

But honestly, the best investment opportunity right now is in cannabis.  I also see it as a play on climate change, as people look to self-medicate more and more as society while they know it begins to fail.","2016-11-10 00:12:04","1","DrTreeMan","1747855273.526611","sea level projections","manual"
