Depends on the temperature. Actually, water contracts as it heats up close to 0 deg C and expands as it cools down.

"cu6djns","t3_3hcv8k","3hcv8k","climatechange","action-oriented","First, you're looking at decadal time scales rather than multi-decadal ones. Natural variation is so noisy on decadal time scales that it may seem as if it's not warming even though it really is if you take a step back to look at longer (and more statistically-significant) time periods.

Second, why only look at satellite records? The land-based datasets are just as useful and accurate, and perhaps even more so.

>Though the recent trans indo-pacific paper entails there is no heat below 700m, and likely lies within 100-300m of the ocean's surface.

Yeah, it appears most of the ""missing heat"" was indeed between 100m and 300m in the Pacific and Indian oceans.

> About 6% of the landmass on earth, but none the less one of the best built to purpose networks we have...shows no significant warming.`

You said it: they only represent 6% of the landmass, so you can't use them to argue that *global* temperatures have not gone up, especially when [these kinds of situations happen.](http://assets.decodedscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/201502.gif)

>So logically the heat (not in the atmosphere, likely not on the land, but in the ocean) should be causing expansion and thus increase SLA exponentially as heat continues to rise exponentially.

Where do you get that ""exponentially"" from? First, sea levels *are* increasing. Second, we're not expecitn ""exponential"" rise on decadal time scales.

I'm sorry, but it's painfully obvious you have no idea what you're talking about.

>Along with evidence that mankind has no affect on the sea level.

There is no such evidence.

>So no rising heat in the atmosphere,

There is rising heat in the atmosphere when you look at time scales that matter.

>no rising heat from the CRN.

Regional dataset.

>Most papers agree it's in the ocean, but the ocean doesn't appear to be responding.

Wrong. The ocean is showing a temperature increase and sea levels are rising.

>So either the heat is negligible, or the ocean is handling it. 

The heat is not negligible, but of course the thermal inertia of the oceans is much larger than the atmosphere's. However, as we can see from ocean-atmosphere heat exchanges, there is no guarantee that the heat will *stay* in the oceans. You might notice [we're heading into what appears to be a record-breaking El Nino...](http://robertscribbler.com/2015/07/27/possible-strongest-el-nino-on-record-gets-another-kick-from-upper-ocean-heat/)

Not only that, but we *should*, because our continued use of fossil fuels in indeed causing temperatures to rise, and according to the IPCC this could reach up to 5C by 2100.

>Though the heat either appears to be far less than what was predicted

> Jeff Jacoby promoted the Oregon Institute petition as delegates convened for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1998. Jacoby, a columnist for the Boston Globe, said event organizers ""take it for granted"" that global warming is real when scientists do not agree ""that greater concentrations of CO2 would be harmful"" or ""that human activity leads to global warming in the first place.""[17] George Woodwell and John Holdren, two members of the National Academy of Sciences, responded to Jacoby in the International Herald Tribune, describing the petition as a ""farce"" in part because ""the signatories are listed without titles or affiliations that would permit an assessment of their credentials.""[18] Myanna Lahsen said, ""Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few."" The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics ""added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved"".[19] Approved names on the list included fictional characters from the television show M*A*S*H,[20] the movie Star Wars,[19] Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as ""I. C. Ewe"".[21] When questioned about the pop singer during a telephone interview with Joseph Hubert of the Associated Press, Robinson acknowledged that her endorsement and degree in microbiology was inauthentic, remarking ""When we're getting thousands of signatures there's no way of filtering out a fake"".[20] A cursory examination by Todd Shelly of the Hawaii Reporter revealed duplicate entries, single names lacking any initial, and even corporate names. ""These examples underscore a major weakness of the list: there is no way to check the authenticity of the names. Names are given, but no identifying information (e.g., institutional affiliation) is provided.""[22] According to the Petition Project website, the issue of duplication has been resolved.[23] Kevin Grandia offered similar criticism, saying although the Petition Project website provides a breakdown of ""areas of expertise"", it fails to assort the 0.5% of signatories who claim to have a background in Climatology and Atmospheric Science by name, making independent verification difficult. ""This makes an already questionable list seem completely insignificant"".[24]

> In 2001, Scientific American took a random sample ""of 30 of the 1,400 signatories claiming to hold a Ph.D. in a climate-related science.""

> Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition —- one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages. Crudely extrapolating, the petition supporters include a core of about 200 climate researchers – a respectable number, though rather a small fraction of the climatological community.[25]

> Former New Scientist correspondent Peter Hadfield says scientists are not experts on every topic, as depicted by the character Brains in Thunderbirds. Rather, they must specialize:

 > ""In between Aaagard and Zylkowski, the first and last names on the petition, are an assortment of metallurgists, botanists, agronomists, organic chemists and so on. ... The vast majority of scientists who signed the petition have never studied climatology and don't do any research into it. It doesn't matter if you're a Ph.D. A Ph.D in metallurgy just makes you better at metallurgy. It does not transform you into some kind of expert in paleoclimatology. ... So the petition's suggestion that everyone with a degree in metallurgy or geophysics knows a lot about climate change, or is familiar with all the research that's been done, is patent crap.""[26][27]

According to Wise's calculations linked to above, if we want to stop climate change, but also want 9 billion people by 2050 to have the standard of living the EU has in 2007, CO2 per dollar of GDP will have to decline from 768 in 2007, to just 14 grams per dollar by 2050.

That looks really difficult to me on first sight, so I have the following questions:

As both a moderator here and somebody who frequently spends (perhaps ""wastes"") a lot of timing debating with climate change deniers online, it's clear to see that many of the online commenters are just the tip of a mass media effort to redefine climate change as a political argument in order to detract from the science and make the implications of climate change something to dismiss as socialist/liberal alarmism. Many popular mass media publications regularly ridicule the scientists and science of climate change, and anyone that accepts the science in general, all the while driving home the point that it's a political issue, not a scientific or even societal one. Then reaching further up the ladder, we see entire political parties express almost venomous hate toward anything climate science, while even the governments that claim to believe the science are still mostly allowing and often encouraging fossil fuel explorations.

The plan to *prevent* meaningful action on climate change does appear to have been an enormous success.

So, my main question is, what will it take to change this?

Protesting and writing letters to our representatives doesn't appear to have done enough so far. Often it seems that people are even more politically entrenched in their opposition to climate change actions nowadays than a decade ago. Almost every national and international scientific institution has declared that climate change is real and caused by human activities, thousands of scientific reports and papers are published every year, evidence is constantly accumulating to show that we are the cause and things are already becoming unstable, yet here we still are, applying all this work and effort only for our wheels to continue spinning in the mud.

Because if the basic income is not vegan then we would be making the problem bigger , but if we can create a system that incentives a plant-based diet and begin growing food locally where possible and build permaculture systems and a massive reforestation campaign using the land that is now growing corn and soy to feed farmed animals etc, We can also create a job program whereby each community has vocational training to grow food for their communities and learn to prepare meals.

Also, I have noticed that you started much earlier than 1 PM and I made a post on r/vegan announcing your AMA here so if you would like to some day do a AMA on r/vegan you are welcome to do so and we would love to talk and help you as we have been educating ourselves of the effects Animal Agriculture is having on our environment and we now have 55,000 subscribers with so many people passionate and wanting to do more.

I've seen many mainstream news articles about the latest dire climate science that report the findings accurately, and then conclude by suggesting (often by citing a quote from you) that a carbon price will be enough to prevent the worst.

A carbon fee-and-dividend, as Citizens' Climate Lobby proposes, seems like a great first step, but it seems clear that much more is needed, very soon, to draw down emissions as rapidly as necessary to prevent a rise of 2C or more (and even more to avoid 1.5C, as you advocate).

Other climate scientists like Michael Mann have advocated for an [economic mobilization on the scale of the American World War II mobilization](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org) to eliminate and withdraw excess greenhouse gas emissions, and a growing number of people, including CCL founder Marshall Saunders, are [signing a pledge](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/notable_pledge_signers) to endorse this platform and build toward the massive political will necessary to achieve it in the U.S.

Do you agree with their assessment that such a mobilization is necessary?

I've been feeling conflicted lately, so I just have a quick question. It's true we need to start taking action, and with all of this attention drawn to needing an **urgent** reduction in GHG, I find it frustrating that some drivers get ignored. I recently came upon a number of studies that put animal agriculture as a very major driver of climate change,^[1](http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm),[2](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)  and that they will only get worse^[3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v515/n7528/full/nature13959.html). How can we tackle the contributions to carbon dioxide emissions due to animal agriculture, and should this be something we deal with as a nation? Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.^[4](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294) As a very politicized topic, is it ever possible for our government to endorse a slow reduction of consumption of animal products, or a similar initiative? How can we ardently push for reduction in transportation and reorganization of our energy sources (which I completely agree with) but willingly ignore this very integral part of climate change?

"cu0cmvd","t3_3gporh","3gporh","science","scientific","A multi-meter rise in ocean levels seems beyond the usual claims, so to what extent would a multi-meter rise in ocean levels mitigate ocean acidification?

It's scientifically clear that anthropogenic warming is happening, but it seems less clear to me that the consequences will be a global cataclysm for humans. By which I mean, possibly many areas will experience increased drought, possibly many areas will experience increased storm frequency and intensity, possibly many species in the oceans would die from increased acidification, and consequently we would probably see drastically reduced biodiversity.

However, none of the above necessarily entails that *many human lives would be lost* due to climate change, which is what most people care about. Drought is handled by transportation or relocation, storms are handled by construction or relocation, and loss of biodiversity is handled by our reliance on agriculture. So even if climate engineering were to fail, our other means of mitigating the problems aren't necessarily inapplicable simply because the climate changes. Would you agree with this assessment? I think this belief that humans aren't really at risk may hold many people back from endorsing swift and immediate change.

I endorse change simply because tens of thousands of people per year *already die* from air pollution in the US alone, which is a *real and quantifiable cost* we're paying right now. The costs of anthropogenic warming seem less clear by comparison, and if you can't quantify it in real terms as being *even more costly* than the tens of thousands of lives per year we're clearly already willing to sacrifice, then convincing such people would be difficult indeed.","2015-08-12 13:52:01","4","naasking","1747842191.7358015","sea level projections","manual"

The PDO was cold from the late 1940s to the late 1970s, and it was warm from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, similar to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).""","2015-08-03 13:33:11","15","Dark-Star7","1747842233.970006","sea level projections","manual"

Is it true that glaciation has only relatively existed in the past 250k years of the Quatenary Glaciation.  

Though we often cite only the recent 10k years on temp changes and carbon in the atmosphere on climate change studies.  I thought we have ice cores going back millions of years?

And that we have an average warming period documented in the Middle Ages prior to the industrial revolution  


Source of reading on my interest of the historical North American climate.

https://www2.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html
The images presented here show the paleogeography of North America over the last 550 million years of geologic history. The 40 images shown here are selected from a suite of approximately 100 maps that are in time slices mostly 5-10 million years apart. By using such tightly spaced time slices, individual paleogeographic and tectonic elements can be followed and intuitively related from time slice to adjacent time slice. Because of space limitations only 40 of the 100 images are presented here but but most shifts of tectonic elements and depositional systems can still be followed. The maps were prepared with the core of North America (Laurentia) fixed. All other tectonic elements are shown moving against or splitting away from Laurentia, thus showing clearly accretionary and rifting events in North America's geologic history. The views were prepared by wrapping a rectangular outline map on a sphere and viewing the globe rotated to 35° N and 100° W. Various stratigraphic, tectonic, and sedimentologic data were added to the map. Topography was ""cloned"" from digital elevation maps of modern Earth from the USGS, NOAA, and other sources. Colors were adjusted to portray climate and vegetation for the given time and location. The geologic data were gathered from the references listed below.

"ctptwvi","t3_3flzb4","3flzb4","science","scientific",">most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. 

This seems to be a very important distinction, and I'm amazed that the observation that the models and observations were actually showing different measurements has not been made public before this.  

There has been a claim that most of the warming i the last 15 to 18 years has gone into the oceans below the surface, and that's why the models and observations have diverged over that time period.  There are models of projected sea temperature changes, and I believe those models do not model the air 2 meters above, but actual water temperatures. 

Given that the models that we are normally presented with have historically depicted air temperatures, and 71% of the planet is ocean, where air temperatures are not measured, but water temperatures are, and given that we know that the ocean depths are warming, but water takes a lot more energy per unit temperature change, is the current use of air temperature at the surface in any way a reasonable way to depict Climate Change?  

The biggest, most often used warning issued by Climate Scientists and activists is that the world will warm by 3º ± 1.5º C after a doubling of CO2.  But, is that ""air temperature, 2 meters off the ground?"" and if we're not measuring the air temperature, 2 meters off the ground for most of the planet, should we be using a different warning altogether?

"ctpvyht","t3_3flzb4","3flzb4","science","scientific","Playing devil's advocate here, this is basically what a Ph.D nuclear physicist told me at my University...  Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are not a significant driver of global warming.  CO2 gas holds far less energy/heat than water vapor, and water vapor of course is present in staggering amounts in our atmosphere. So basically all the CO2 we've put into the air is a mere drop in the bucket and insignificant in driving climate change.

The primary driver of climate change is essentially cities, buildings, roads, parking lots, etc which absorb an absurdly high amount of solar radiation when compared to the plant life that would have been in it's place.

So he is saying that humans drive climate change but we are erroneously fixated on CO2 because the graphs people make linking CO2 and global mean heat seem to correlate; an example of correlation but not causation.

One. I've come to the realization that one of the reasons the debate has been about ""If there's a connection between fossil fuels and AGW"" instead of ""How much of a connection,"" is because a significant percentage of the US population doesn't have the slightest understanding of the greenhouse effect. 

In my opinion, your biggest challenge in getting the public to accept your climate modeling will be getting them to first understand the greenhouse effect.   Are there any efforts to do this?

Two. I saw the 2007 Arctic summer ice melt as one of the turning points over the last decade. I got the sense that a lot of scientists and politicians realized that events could be accelerated decades ahead of expected predictions.
