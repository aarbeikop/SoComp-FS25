"erag8wf","t3_c1290l","c1290l","climatechange","action-oriented","> You see before and after pictures of the ice caps from like 1970 to now and a massive amount has melted off. Yet the sea level hasn't risen. 

First you have to distinguish between sea ice and land ice.  

Since sea ice is floating, it doesn’t change sea level when it melts (you do get some due to density differences, but it is a rounding error compared to land ice melting).

Land ice divides up like this: Antarctica and Greenland (99%), all the other land ice in the whole world (1%).  So it matters that glaciers are melting, but it’s more that people will lose the fresh water that comes from them rather than them being a major cause of sea level rise.  Also, it still snows in cold places, in fact it even snows a bit more than it used to ...

https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2836/antarcticas-contribution-to-sea-level-rise-was-mitigated-by-snowfall/

so the “mass balance” of the land ice changes slowly, like thousands of years slowly.  When you read a newspaper article that says “Greenland could melt and raise sea level 20 feet” you have to mentally add “which would take 3000 years.”  (Geologically, this is a short amount of time).

This slowness cuts both ways though.  Even if we stopped global warming tomorrow, land ice mass balance would keep changing for hundreds of years.","2019-06-15 23:58:37","9","technologyisnatural","1747883671.5772676","sea level projections","manual"

[This graph](https://bonjourplanetearth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ar5sl2030.jpg) shows projections for sea level rise out to 2030, published in IPCC AR5, against tide gauge (Dangendorf) and satellite altimeter (aviso) observations. Sea level rise has proceeded very much in-line with expectations. That's for the RCP8.5 pathway but there's very little difference between pathways by 2030.

[This graph](https://bonjourplanetearth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ar5sl-contrib2030.jpg) shows projected individual contributions to 2030 sea level rise from different factors.

"eraig0y","t3_c1290l","c1290l","climatechange","action-oriented","According to the IPCC's most recent assessment report a few years ago, sea levels have already risen about 19 cm between 1901 and 2010. This rise has accelerated greatly in the last few decades. According to the NOAA, this rise was based about equally on thermal expansion of the ocean water and ice loss, but after, ice loss has contributed the bulk. One thing to keep in mind is that the rise is unevenly distributed around the world. 

Far from exaggerating the rise, the IPCC has historically underestimated it. Since the 90s, sea level rise has tracked their highest estimates. Most recently, the IPCC has predicted that sea levels will rise up to 1 meter by 2100 with continued emissions. According to many, this is actually a very conservative guess, and a rise of twice that by then is ""plausible."" 

The source of most of that uncertainty lies in the lack of clarity regarding the mechanisms of ice melt. While thermal expansion is fairly well modeled on a direct physical level at this point, the physics of ice melt are more emergent and there is less certainty. 

A final point, it is also clear that sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even without emissions due to feedback loops and continued warming may force ice sheets to a tipping point beyond which sea level rise will be hard to mitigate.

Idk about half the US, but with continued emissions through the century, perhaps more than 100 million people will be displaced from coastal areas, small islands will face devastating impacts, and the magnitude of storm surges will increase. Even in a pathway that keeps us below 1.5 degrees of warming since 1850, the results are disastrous, and they just get worse the warmer it gets. Most importantly, the uncertainty regarding sea level rise skews towards more, not less; we know it'll be bad, and it is very unlikely it'll be better, and much more likely it'll be worse. The effects will be very unevenly distributed to poorer marginalized people and countries.","2019-06-16 00:28:52","2","magalouge","1747883671.5948553","sea level projections","manual"

>>“Look, the press, the city, everybody here needs to have a good bedside manner about this issue (of climate change)” says Ben Solomon, president of the South Florida Builder’s Association, which represents Miami’s politically powerful developers.

>>Basically, he talked about Miami as if it were a patient suffering a terminal disease.

>>“It’s definitely going to affect the market here,” he assured me. “I just hope that this thing is far enough away that we still have at least five or six good business cycles left.”

>>Solomon’s cynical calculation hinges on the fact that many developers don’t quite care about what happens to Miami 30 years from now, since they don’t really plan on owning the properties they construct for anywhere near that amount of time.

...

>>It’s a complicated ecosystem, but at the top of its food chain sits the world’s giant reinsurance companies. Corporates titans like Swiss RE or Lloyd’s of London, which make their money off of insuring other insurer’s insurance policies, might very well decide to pull out of the South Florida real estate market long before the water starts lapping at our door.

>>“That would definitely be one of the worst case scenarios,” says Mr. Murley.

>>Such a decision would lead to a cash crunch in the region that could bring house prices – including that of any I might own – tumbling. Ominously, the regional bank BankUnited has already quietly stopped generating mortgages in the area.

>>County officials have spent the past three years holding high-level talks with major reinsurers, assuaging their fears. Murley doesn’t think they’re pulling out anytime soon, but he’s looking ahead to a Miami that might have to abandon the beach and pull back from its barrier islands.","2019-06-01 16:32:42","1","naufrag","1747883713.230393","sea level projections","manual"

What if we could modify a mitochondria (not for the purposes of replacing the mitochondria but as a template for an entirely new artificial organelle with its own metabolism and DNA) to process data, network together on some kind of cloud network, synthesize oligonucleotide sequences from scratch, and express them from its own dna rather than integrating them into the nuclear genome? These mechanics would be all you need to download and express genes like apps without risking the health of the nuclear genome, as well as to monitor the health of the nuclear genome by sequencing and comparing the RNA expressed by it with other cells. Even if the processing capacity of every modified mitochondria was in the kbs, with trillions of cells you'd have an incredible amount of processing capacity and could run programs on the cloud network that are stored directly on DNA. Like running antivirus software that scans for actual viruses. This network could even be programmed to simulate a brain machine interface, giving the individual subjective access to their internal, cellular cloud network. 

There are countless applications. You could run thousands of genetic studies in parallel in a single petri dish. Every cell would be its own lab. And forget labs on a chip when you can directly express any cell type you want by programming it into a live cell culture. You could run these tests in parallel IN VIVO if you wanted.  

And I often imagine the kind of complex mechanics that we could engineer with this level of control. One of the proteins I imagined being expressed from these artificial mitochondria (I call them nanosomes) could lock together passively using modified nucleophiles. I imagined modifying a nucleophile so that it would have a dipole tail rotating on a single carbon bond. If arranged on a plane at an angle, you could create a 2d surface that switches between hydrophobic and hydrophilic states via phosphorylation. I imagined these little proteins to be in the shape of blocks, and they would be able to auto assemble into larger complexes by selectively locking each of their faces together like lego or a transformer. You'd only need to phosphorylate a junction once to lock it, and then again to unlock it. Over and over again. 

I guess amine/carboxyl groups already do this, minus the phosphorylation, but they don't auto-assemble in free space. And so far that's only one degree of motion. I also imagined building protein based optical tweezers for interacting with and grabbing onto dielectric molecules around the cell, which most polar molecules are. Single plasmon lasers can be built using complexes of only 10 or 20 atoms. If we could modify an amino acid to act as a single plasmon laser when phosphorylated, we would be able to produce an extremely efficient, directed light source that could have countless applications around the cell, and could be integrated into a protein by associating a codon to it. And again, this is expressed from an artificial organelle, so we'd have the luxury of being able to modify the codon language. From optical communication systems to microscopic spacial light modulators using chiral molecules abundant around the cell as the liquid crystal. A flexible lens made out of cholesterol or an even more simple chiral lipid would be able to change both the phase and focus of a microscopic light source. And while its difficult for us to make use of optical tweezers on the macroscopic scale, interacting with other molecules is ideal if you just want to identify single molecules or push/pull a neighboring proteins in a protein complex. And here's your second degree of motion. 

Also plasmons may sound like particle physics but they play a role in photosynthesis, especially for purple, sulfur based bacteria, which basically relies on sunlight and a plasmon cascade to produce an energy surplus from excitons when the cascade runs into the cell membrane. I read another paper demonstrating that this structure, the entire cell membrane, can become coherent and entangle with a quantum cavity. The largest structure to ever be entangled. And I think a lot about using these single plasmon lasers for quantum logic functions inside the cell, but given the ambient temperature of the cell, that's mostly speculative. 

Again, this isn't really formatted in the form of a question, but I would love to hear your thoughts on these or similar applications of using biology for the purposes of synthetic nano technology.","2019-06-13 17:28:43","3","Asrivak","1747883850.758977","sea level projections","manual"

I have predicted a lot of stuff as of late, and I believed it was too late a long time ago due to real news articles on the matter. I still believe in the invisible though. It is truly amazing. Do you think that after humanity faces the cliff and dies, for the most part, these invisible things would help humanity more? I've had dreams of the future. It isn't pretty, but some people don't deserve what is coming. They wanted change, but the system is so antichange, it was impossible alone to go against it. 

The world can't function without the invisible. I really think we threw spirituality in the trash as our masters and disciples of materialism told us to do. Those who follow spirituality are left poor and with a hard time to survive.  

The reason I don't give up hope is. 1) we are conscious beings, at least a few of us unless this is a simulation and I am the only conscious being in the simulation everyone else is an npc. 2) science doesn't know everything. It mostly knows this world and there is evidence there are more worlds or universes. Now science says the universe is all just ideas, so we are going back full circle.
