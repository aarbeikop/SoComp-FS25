Don't pin me down on the exact numbers, but I believe that in order to produce 1 kilogram of beef you need north of 20 kilogram of organic matter. These ratios are different for chicken, fish and dairy products, but all these products are very inefficient.

Instead of producing beef, it would be much more efficient to produce 20 kg of organic matter suitable for humans to eat instead (i.e. vegetables etc).

Would cellular agriculture be (much) more efficient, if these processes are developed into industrial scale?

What is the intended use case for cellular agriculture? What is your ultimate objective and how do you think it would work in the society? 

Western societies eat more meat than ever in history and it's so cheap it doesn't even make sense. Also, many people, including me, are moving away from processed food and paying a premium price to eat locally grown food from responsible farms (even if I don't buy ""full"" organic, as I think it's unscientific). How would cellular agriculture products fit into this consumer preferences shift?

For background, in europe you can get ground **beef** for prices lower than 5€/kg!!!! Such a low price doesn't even make sense. From a policy perspective it would make sense to try to make meat production more difficult, so that prices could rise back to levels when families ate beef once a week. 
I'm poor, I decided to buy exclusively unprocessed locally produced food. And I still can afford much more food and meat than it would be healthy!!

Obviously this work is quite different from what you're doing, but stem cell work and a lot of tissue and cell culture work requires adding a number of antibiotics, hormones, growth factors, cytokines, etc. directly to cell media to promote the growth of the correct cell/tissue type and to prevent infection. A lot of people currently take issue with the use of hormones and antibiotics in commercial meat and dairy - do you think it would be possible to circumvent this problem when creating meat in a dish, or is it unavoidable? Are there certain components of cell media that you are looking to avoid or replace to commercialize these meats? Though I'm sure it's a pretty small amount, I would be particularly concerned because the small molecules, hormones, etc. and all are being added directly to tissue in this case, rather than going through the first-pass metabolism in a live animal.

Was wondering if there is any evidence of a bigger island that maybe Maori people have lived on before migrating to New Zealand? Something that could explain the homeland of Maori people? 

My apologies if the question is silly :) ","2017-09-01 12:51:39","1","ArmedProphet88","1747864630.5364573","sea level projections","manual"

Since yesterday, we have transited to a new site on the eastern edge of the Lord Howe Rise. We have just stopped the ship and placed in dynamic position mode. Should be getting material from an area never drilled before in about 8 hours -- always exiting to see the unknown appear.

I've been looking into the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis and I noticed something. We used to have far warmer environments that didn't seem to set off the Clathrate gun, example being during the [Pliocene climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene_climate) the Earth was 2-3 °C higher than today. Since we're on a path to surpassing the 2 °C mark, it's reasonable to assume that the Earth will be very similar to the way it was 5-2 mya. In that case, then shouldn't the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis be proven false since the conditions for which it would have occurred have existed before but didn't set it off?","2017-09-03 22:10:25","1","[deleted]","1747864630.5583906","sea level projections","manual"
