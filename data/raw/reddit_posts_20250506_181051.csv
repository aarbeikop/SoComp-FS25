There’s a lot of confusion online about Jevons Paradox — especially when it’s used to argue that making renewables cheaper somehow *keeps fossil fuels alive*. That’s not what the paradox says. Let’s clear this up.

---

###  **What is Jevons Paradox?**

Jevons Paradox comes from 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons. He observed that **as steam engines became more efficient**, they made coal-powered energy cheaper — and total **coal consumption increased**, not decreased.

**In short:**  
> *Making a resource cheaper or more efficient to use can lead to *more* demand for that same resource.*

Example:
- In the 1800s, **more efficient steam engines** made coal more useful. This led to an explosion in coal use and **displaced older tech like waterwheels** and manual labor.

---

### **What Jevons Paradox is *not***:

It’s not a law that says efficiency always backfires.  
It’s not a reason why fossil fuels will persist forever.  
And crucially, it **does not apply** when one energy source **replaces** another — that’s called **substitution**, not Jevons.

---

###  **Substitution is not Jevons**

Let’s look at some examples of substitution — cases where *new* energy or transport technologies displaced *older* ones:

-  **Cheap fracked natural gas** in the U.S. displaced coal in electricity generation. Gas was cheaper and cleaner, so coal plants shut down. That’s **not** Jevons — that’s substitution.
-  **Cheap automobiles** replaced horses. Nobody said, “cars got so cheap that we started breeding more horses.”
-  **Electric lighting** replaced gas lamps and candles. We didn’t suddenly consume more whale oil because LEDs got cheaper.
-  **Cheap solar and wind** are now displacing coal and increasingly gas, because they’re becoming the cheapest sources of electricity in many markets.

If Jevons Paradox applied in these cases, we’d see *more* of the old resource being used. But we don’t — we see it being pushed out.

---

### **So what *is* happening with energy today?**

Yes, total electricity demand is rising — from EVs, heat pumps, data centers, and development. That’s true. But that doesn’t *require* fossil fuels to grow. It just means **we need more energy** — and the cheapest sources will win.

If fossil fuels aren’t being phased out quickly enough, the reasons are:

- Political lobbying and regulatory capture
- Market inertia and grid bottlenecks
- Subsidies that favor incumbents

Those are real problems — but they’re not Jevons Paradox.

---

###  **Bottom Line**

Jevons Paradox says that making a *resource* more efficient can increase its use.  
It **does not** say that switching to a new, cheaper energy source will keep the old one alive.  
In fact, history shows the opposite: **the cheaper resource usually wins** — and pushes the old one out.

---

**TL;DR**:  
Cheaper solar ≠ more coal.  
Cheaper gas ≠ more coal.  
Cheaper cars ≠ more horses.
