Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

https://preview.redd.it/jnvvpx5j9aye1.jpeg?width=2329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5212929e12e6c3092885e908d8cf2f10a454c1e0

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:

I write and post on a number of sites and have been attacked for having no “academic credentials” in any field related to climate science. I do not wish to misrepresent myself as a “climate scientist” or “climate expert” to anyone who is reading this or any of my other climate related posts, so let us be clear:

I am not a climatologist, meteorologist, paleo-climatologist, geoscientist, ecologist, or climate science specialist. I am a motivated individual studying the issue using publicly available datasets and papers.

The analysis I am presenting is my own. I make no claim to “insider or hidden knowledge” and all the points I discuss can be verified with only a few hours of research on the Internet.

The analysis and opinion I present, in this and my other climate articles is exactly that: my opinion. I hope anyone reading it finds it useful, informative, and insightful but in the end, it is just my opinion.

So i'm pretty sure there must be more than one anomaly with at least a full degree jump somewhere else.
