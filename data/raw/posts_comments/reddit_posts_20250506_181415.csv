1kbi0si,climatechange,action-oriented,Need people to weigh in if ethical or moral (carbon credits),"I run a webservice which replaces single use hardware (fax machines). A single fax machine consumes on average 7 watts per hour idle. Based on my calculations we are saving approximately 250 kilowatts per hour by having these theoretical machines offline. That is 6 megawatt hours per day.

I could conceivably sell carbon credits and make some additional income doing so.

However, morally I feel this may be short sited as all that does is create a license for polluters to exhaust more co2 guilt free. 

Is my analysis incorrect? I am leaning towards not doing this, but if there is a way to not feel like this would undo all the good benefits we created, please let me know. I do not know much about the ethics of carbon credits, to be honest.",1746023652.0,5,16,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1kbi0si/need_people_to_weigh_in_if_ethical_or_moral/,True,Adam7288,1746548016.7669451,CO2 is good,skeptical
