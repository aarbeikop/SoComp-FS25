Richard Muller, funded by Charles Koch Charitable Foundation, was a climate sceptic. He and 12 other skeptics were [paid by fossil fuel companies, but actually found evidence climate change was real](https://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/climatechange-denier-changes-mind/news-story/e0433a661400feb82345e5d5108cc2ce)

In 2011, he stated that “following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.”

If you’re looking for an example of the opposite, a climate scientist who believed in anthropogenic climate change, and actually found evidence against it… there isn’t one. Needless to say the fossil fuel industry never funded Muller again.

If there was a way to disprove or dispute AGW, the fossil fuel industry would fund it and there would be examples of it. But they are more than aware with humanity’s impact

mr424gd,t3_1kh3nh7,1kh3nh7,climatechange,action-oriented,"It is a well known fact that climate change is caused by humans. Let’s look at the evidence:

1. CO2 causes warming. This is easy to prove. You can look up tabletop experiments you can try in your kitchen. Tl;dr is that CO2 absorbs light and release it as heat. 

2. Humans are the main source of CO2. We know this because CO2 picks up as the Industrial Revolution began, which is when we started combustion billions of tons of carbon rich materials that used to be locked in long-term geologic storage. We know this from measuring gas bubbles in ice cores. We know exactly what was in the air for the past few thousand years. 

3. The only modeling and uncertainty is where the climate is going. But those models are really good. In fact, the climate models are so good that major petroleum companies used to use them to predict where to find fossil fuel deposits (while funding climate denial campaigns). 


In terms of one figure, I don’t think there’s one that will convince them. Mauna Loa shows a persistent, increasing rate of CO2 in the atmosphere. ShowYourStripes shows persistent increased tropospheric temperatures. If I had to pick one, I’d do this one from [New Scientist that shows air and sea surface temperatures](https://images.app.goo.gl/nAWB8sEXZ8gTw7sS8) for the past few years (notice how similar those temperature curves are to CO2!). 

I work in industrial decarbonization and it’s remarkable how many companies who used to say climate change isn’t real are now pouring billions of dollars into climate technologies.

3. Runs an extensive vegetable garden.

From an economics perspective, in particular - with the massive growth in a range of global multi-billion solutions industries and a broad range of commercial clean innovative technologies - to what extent do we need to keep working on building ""belief in the problem""?  

The world's innovators and entrepreneurs were convinced there were opportunities decades ago - and many have been relentlessly commercialising solutions since the 1990s. (Though solar panels actually date back to the 1860s - because innovators just want to innovate.)

Today, renewable energy, EVs and regenerative agriculture are high-growth multi-billion dollar global industries, and many more solutions are scaling.  In parallel, 21st century design approaches such as full-spectrum Circular Economy and Biomimicry are driving trillion-dollar innovation opportunities in industry with rapidly shrinking payback periods.

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Large corporations and investors have the resources to access this information and shift their operations away from high-risk areas. Worst case scenario, they will refuse to serve some potential customers, just like [insurance companies](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5269609/la-fires-homes-insurance-state-farm-allstate) and [power grid operators](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2024/10/08/796380.htm) already do in areas of California that are the most exposed to fire hazards.
