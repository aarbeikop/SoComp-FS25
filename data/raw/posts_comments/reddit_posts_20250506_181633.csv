1kain92,sustainability,action-oriented,Plastic bag production energy and petroleum consumption,"So, as you know there have been quite a bit of studies comparing paper or cotton vs plastic bag carbon  footprint. I wanted to know what methodology was used to calculate the environmental costs of each bag particularly the plastic bags. And while i see raw material production for paper and cotton bags such as eutrophication due to fertiliser use etc but not much mention on environmental impact of oil drilling. Plastic bags are lighter and use less materials than both cotton and paper bags so their carbon emissions being less makes sense but i really wanted to know the carbon emissions of oil production and PE production etc and whether they're added into plastic bags production or not? Any leads related to this topic would be greatly appreciated",1745913771.0,1,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/1kain92/plastic_bag_production_energy_and_petroleum/,True,Tuotus,1746548186.931554,carbon footprint,solutions
