The failure is TIME, Need, and Opportunity Cost.

Who has the time to increase driving that much?

And don't we have better things to do than just drive?",1746237742.0,9,LakeSun,1746547811.678426,renewables now,action_oriented

We shouldn't have replaced cars because of fossil fuels but because they are generally inefficient and costly to the environment.


But we didn't, we chose to ""reform"" our consumption, not revolutionise it.",1746218332.0,4,Glittering_Chain8985,1746547811.680217,renewables now,action_oriented
mqaw63r,t3_1kda74q,1kda74q,climatechange,action-oriented,"When photovoltaics drive electricity prices into negative territory there will be a strong market incentive to utilize that surplus energy.  Otherwise it is just wasted.  

Almost no one uses crude oil in any applications.  Instead crude oil is usually distilled and then fed into a catalytic cracker: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking.  

Petroleum refineries burn some of the crude oil in order to create heat and/or pressure.  That means that they produce less products for a given quantity of crude feedstock.  Refineries also often make low value byproducts like petroleum coke.  However, if electricity from photovoltaics is cheap and abundant the refinery can use the electricity to create heat and pressure.  They can also use electrolysis of water or electrolysis of process fluids to produce hydrogen.  Feeding hydrogen gas into the cracker avoids all of the difficulties of storing or transporting hydrogen gas.  Today it is common to use methane as a hydrogen source in petroleum cracking.  

Photovoltaic electricity can also be used to pump oil in oil fields.",1746236315.0,1,NearABE,1746547811.682914,renewables now,action_oriented

This is not the case for most energy sources used since the late 1700s. Thinking of energy in terms of ages/transitions has so far been empirically wrong, read Fressoz's book on it.",1746279287.0,1,wokepatrickbateman,1746547811.684024,renewables now,action_oriented

Of more relevance to the sub, having an efficient use for sunlight has greatly increased our consumption of sunlight. This will have an environmental impact.",1746313526.0,1,TimJBenham,1746547811.685247,renewables now,action_oriented
