mptxe6p,t3_1kb2n59,1kb2n59,sustainability,action-oriented,"A lot of sustainability practices will save you money.

In an extreme example of buying local, I grow vegetables in my back yard.  This saves me money.  Last summer I spend $20 a month on groceries.  It also helps the environment.

In the interest of making my backyard garden better, I started composting.  I get free nutrient rich dirt and I've also diverted roughly half of my waste stream away from the landfill.   

I walk or ride my bike anywhere I have to go that's less than 6 KM away (which includes work, which is exactly 6 km away).  Saves me money on gas and wear and tear on the car, saves CO2 from the environment, and helps keep me fit and alive.

Buying foods in bulk saves you money and cuts down on packaging.  I buy flour in 10 or 20 kg bags, which admittedly was difficult to bring home on my bike before I got the bike trailer.",1746017101.0,3,KnoWanUKnow2,1746548309.606645,eco friendly habits,solutions
