For example, China has a huge amount of solar and wind however their coal generation is still increasing also because of increased demand.  We now have to contend with huge power consumers like AI and cryptocurrency mining.  So to me it feels like we are meeting new needs with renewables rather than reducing fossil fuel usage overall.

The key metrics are carbon levels in the atmosphere and estimated carbon emissions per annum, and on both of these we are still going in the wrong direction.

I am an optimist. I honestly believe that we will tackle climate change and avoid the absolute worst case scenarios predicted. Some amazing work is being done by millions of people. and the prospects from the likes of renewable energy really excites me, as it shows what can be done through concerted effort.

But blind optimism achieves nothing, in the same way that blind doomerism does the same. The facts and the evidence need to inform what we do, and those facts are not promising at the moment.

No, over half of Europe's electricity is already renewable. Energy is not only electricity. Electricity represents a part of the energy mix, but energy also include things such as the petrol in combustion vehicles, the gas used for heating. Yes, the portion of energy being used as electricity can be increased, but when we say more than half of Europe's electricity is coming from renewables. It means that out of the portion of energy being used as electricity, more half of it is coming from renewables, but says nothing about the rest of energy use.",1746689865.0,1,Imagine_Beyond,1746700544.121002,CO2 emissions,scientific

mr7seba,t3_1khjgbo,1khjgbo,climatechange,action-oriented,"“Now we have people complaining about getting 2 degrees above preindustrial levels by 2100 which is not good but kind you won’t probably happen” 
So much wrong with that comment I don’t know where to begin. First in a round about year you are not wrong, we aren’t set to be above 2 degrees from preindustrial levels, we are set to go well over that within the next 25 years. Also even if we somehow where to not no over the 2 degrees number that would still mean that many environments would see catastrophic changes in their ecosystems with mass extinctions, inhabitable land, reduced crop yield, etc. 2 degrees above pre industrial level is not a “good” goal to aspire to, that’s just a goal that was set on that was atleast somewhat realistic and that didn’t substantially pose a threat to first worlds counties production/ economy.

“Let’s not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable…electric vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by normal people” 
The main issue with this line of thinking is that solar panels/electric cars being economical or more practical doesn’t substantially change the way that people in the first world pollute to maintain standard of living. Like think of this what good does it make to use solar panels if we are suing it power stuff like air conditioning(which is really bad for the environment btw), machinery to make unnecessary cheap consumer goods, or to power things like large data centers for example which don’t just need power but large amounts of computers, communication infrastructure, land, and the construction of all that? Like of course if their is a choice between getting something powered by fossil fuels or solar panels obviously solar panels are the much better choice but the issue is that this is a change that is ultimately not nearly enough to make a substantial change in how our way of life impacts our environment. Like think about it like this, if someone close to me was telling me how bad smoking is and that I should stop, would it be reasonable for me to respond with “but my cigarette has a filter on it so it’s not as bad”? Like yes there are things that can make harmful behavior slightly better but the overall issue is not substantially being addressed with the marginal improvements.

“EV adoption is at record highs”
And why is this a good thing? Now if you were to tell me that instead all developed countries had limited their car production and were investing more in public transport then you would have some argument but this ultimately doesn’t help solve the issue. This relates to my last point in that this is just, in the grand scheme of things, this marginal improvement is just a way to make people feel better about a frivolous purchase in cars. Yes of course people have to buy cars, especially in a country like the U.S. but if we had a  more robust public transportation system that would mean less pollution since these public transit systems are more efficient per person per mile than cars(amount other things). Also electric cars tend to be higher weight than normal cars in the same class, and high weight cars means more wear and tear on roads which means more maintenance, which means more digging up of things like cement which are very carbon heavy. Like obviously public transport isn’t perfect and face similar issues(land use, rare earth minerals, building up of infrastructure) but the difference is that their is a substantial difference is in environment cost with transporting people via public transport vs cars.

“The enemy is a mere shadow of what is once was” 
That is really not the case in sorry my friend. I hope I didn’t sound mean in my response but people all across the world are suffering as a result of climate change. Look abt many island nations in the pacific that have lost islands or a substantial part of their land due to sea level rise. Or look at the rising number of extinct species and endangered species in Africa alone and how that affected their local ecosystems. How many record hot days have been recorded in just this decade and that number is rising pretty much every few years at this point. Like I don’t mean to harp on this point but I think that your optimism is misguided, perhaps because you are(I’m assuming) from a first world country that is not as severely affected by climate change as many developing countries but if you start looking at the effects of climate change in the global south you will see how fucked we are. I don’t means this to sound pessimistic but it’s the truth we are really fucked and we are well on our way to get even worse.

Obviously we have to continue to fight to mitigate the worst effects of climate change but these ultimately marginal improvements that make some changes to how badly we affect the environment is not a sign to be happy. I mean I think it’s actually kind of sad to see that the only reason renewable energy is being embraced is because it’s economical and not because it’s actually something that is of beneficial regardless of the cost.",1746696163.0,1,Odd-Garlic-8838,1746700544.128266,CO2 emissions,scientific
