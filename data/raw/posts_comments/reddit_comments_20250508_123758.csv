Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

Nobody has 'priced this in' yet.  Those that have saved, will be a great deal better off than those that haven't, but just having 'money in the bank' will not spare you from the worst effects of climate change.  

If you have the ability, it's a good idea to take a small portion of your savings and invest in things that cut your dependency to the outside world as much as possible.  Some ideas I've posted elsewhere:

* A one year supply of food, medicine and essentials.
* Raised beds, aquaponics, and egg hens for fruit, vegge and protien.  Honestly just learning *how* to raise your own food is more valuable than the food itself.
* A well or metal roof and rainwater collection system, as well as the parts to repair it.
* A solar / battery install capable of handling your average usage in winter
* An EV, and e-bike, service manuals and 'consumable spare parts' for both
* A ham radio setup.  Cell networks get overloaded during an emergency and towers go down after a few days without fuel during an extended outage.
* A firearm, and enough experience with it to be effective.  A simple 12ga pump is a great all rounder.

I'm not saying you should be a crazy prepper kitting out his dooms day bunker planning on riding out the apocalypse alone.  Get to know your neighbors.  Share your knowledge and teach them to be more resilient too if they're open to it.  When societies break down, communities stand up.  Take care of your 'tribe' to the best of your ability.

So much wrong with that comment I don’t know where to begin. First in a round about year you are not wrong, we aren’t set to be above 2 degrees from preindustrial levels, we are set to go well over that within the next 25 years. Also even if we somehow where to not no over the 2 degrees number that would still mean that many environments would see catastrophic changes in their ecosystems with mass extinctions, inhabitable land, reduced crop yield, etc. 2 degrees above pre industrial level is not a “good” goal to aspire to, that’s just a goal that was set on that was atleast somewhat realistic and that didn’t substantially pose a threat to first worlds counties production/ economy.

“Let’s not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable…electric vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by normal people” 
The main issue with this line of thinking is that solar panels/electric cars being economical or more practical doesn’t substantially change the way that people in the first world pollute to maintain standard of living. Like think of this what good does it make to use solar panels if we are suing it power stuff like air conditioning(which is really bad for the environment btw), machinery to make unnecessary cheap consumer goods, or to power things like large data centers for example which don’t just need power but large amounts of computers, communication infrastructure, land, and the construction of all that? Like of course if their is a choice between getting something powered by fossil fuels or solar panels obviously solar panels are the much better choice but the issue is that this is a change that is ultimately not nearly enough to make a substantial change in how our way of life impacts our environment. Like think about it like this, if someone close to me was telling me how bad smoking is and that I should stop, would it be reasonable for me to respond with “but my cigarette has a filter on it so it’s not as bad”? Like yes there are things that can make harmful behavior slightly better but the overall issue is not substantially being addressed with the marginal improvements.

“EV adoption is at record highs”
And why is this a good thing? Now if you were to tell me that instead all developed countries had limited their car production and were investing more in public transport then you would have some argument but this ultimately doesn’t help solve the issue. This relates to my last point in that this is just, in the grand scheme of things, this marginal improvement is just a way to make people feel better about a frivolous purchase in cars. Yes of course people have to buy cars, especially in a country like the U.S. but if we had a  more robust public transportation system that would mean less pollution since these public transit systems are more efficient per person per mile than cars(amount other things). Also electric cars tend to be higher weight than normal cars in the same class, and high weight cars means more wear and tear on roads which means more maintenance, which means more digging up of things like cement which are very carbon heavy. Like obviously public transport isn’t perfect and face similar issues(land use, rare earth minerals, building up of infrastructure) but the difference is that their is a substantial difference is in environment cost with transporting people via public transport vs cars.

“The enemy is a mere shadow of what is once was” 
That is really not the case in sorry my friend. I hope I didn’t sound mean in my response but people all across the world are suffering as a result of climate change. Look abt many island nations in the pacific that have lost islands or a substantial part of their land due to sea level rise. Or look at the rising number of extinct species and endangered species in Africa alone and how that affected their local ecosystems. How many record hot days have been recorded in just this decade and that number is rising pretty much every few years at this point. Like I don’t mean to harp on this point but I think that your optimism is misguided, perhaps because you are(I’m assuming) from a first world country that is not as severely affected by climate change as many developing countries but if you start looking at the effects of climate change in the global south you will see how fucked we are. I don’t means this to sound pessimistic but it’s the truth we are really fucked and we are well on our way to get even worse.

Obviously we have to continue to fight to mitigate the worst effects of climate change but these ultimately marginal improvements that make some changes to how badly we affect the environment is not a sign to be happy. I mean I think it’s actually kind of sad to see that the only reason renewable energy is being embraced is because it’s economical and not because it’s actually something that is of beneficial regardless of the cost.",1746696163.0,1,Odd-Garlic-8838,1746700635.67408,global temperature rise,scientific

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

https://preview.redd.it/jnvvpx5j9aye1.jpeg?width=2329&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5212929e12e6c3092885e908d8cf2f10a454c1e0

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.
