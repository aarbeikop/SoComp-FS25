1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,I'm a complete ignoramus about this topic: Please educate me and give me some pointers,"Hello wonderful folks: I'm coming down to earth after years of denial in a radical section of the Church, that is intent upon looking away from climate change and the catastrophic effects of human choices upon plant and animal life. Climate change, they say, is a left wing hoax. I used to believe it for a long time and scoff at people who suggested something was seriously off with the planet.

They say the first step towards change is admitting there is a problem. While I understand that our current use of natural resources is unsustainable in the long run, and accept that climate change is real, I hardly know what I can do to make a change.

I hardly buy clothes, and when I do, I keep them for life. I buy them from military hardware store (Silvermans) so as to have extreme durability and lifespan. I have started to recycle. As you can see from my user name, I am a incense enthusiast. I've learnt a lot about the exploitation of trees for incense and only buy sustainable resins and from sources that ethically source plant resins. But what else can I do? The amount of information online is overwhelming.

Could you please give me a good starting point about learning about sustainability. I'm an intensely pragmatic person who believes in *doing* rather than *talking.* I live modestly, and I say this not as a matter of virtue signalling; just as a matter of fact. I don't drive. I eat vegetarian food. Milk is still hard to quit. Use public transport exclusively. But that's about it.

But I'd love to *do* more. If you know resources that I can use to convince some of my other friends, please point these out to. There is deep denial in some quarters. And I believe the answer is in providing so much information that denial becomes impossible. This is how I began to see the problem.

It's been a humbling and somewhat terrifying journey as I am starting to reckon the impact of my choices. I still don't want it to be true. It causes me serious anxiety as I deeply love the natural world and the thought of it all fading away is giving me sleepless nights. Is it really as bad as I think it is, and is the situation beyond hope? Please provide scientific, meaningful, practical responses. I'd rather hear the bad news than live in the land of lotus eaters.",1746468630.0,12,20,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/1kfijtv/im_a_complete_ignoramus_about_this_topic_please/,True,IncenseHound,1746547956.401126,climate hoax,skeptical
