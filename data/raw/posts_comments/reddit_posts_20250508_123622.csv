1khjgbo,climatechange,action-oriented,Why aren't we celebrating progress on climate change?,"It seems to me that we would rather be pessimistic than optimistic.

Like ""oh we are not doing enough"" or whatever.

But why aren't we celebrating what has already been done?

Let's not forget that just 50 years ago rivers would catch fire (see [Cuyahoga River Fire](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cuyahoga-river-caught-fire-least-dozen-times-no-one-cared-until-1969-180972444/), and it was a perfectly normal occurence too). Smog was everywhere in the cities. Coal plants released a lot of soot into the atmosphere.

Let's not forget that 20 years ago, at the turn of the millenium, scientists were predicting that the temperature would rise 4-5 degrees by 2100. Like think about this. Does this seem absurd to you? Now we got people complaining about getting to 2 degrees above pre industrial levels by 2100 which is not good but mind you probably won't happen anyways.

Let's not forget that just 10 years ago we were talking about how solar panels will never be economically viable and will only be for environmentalists. That electrical vehicles had too many shortfalls to be used by everyday people for everyday uses. That coal will still be used for the coming future (now granted it's replacement natural gas isn't exactly better but at least it doesn't create smog).

We are changing. And we are changing fast. EV adoption is at record highs, especially in China. When I went there before covid (Feb 2019) you'd be lucky to find an EV car that wasn't a taxi or a bus. I would say maybe only 1 in 20 or so (very very vague guess) were EVs. Now? The roads are a lot quieter (visited again in Mar 2025). The air is a lot cleaner. The infamous chinese smog? Gone. Just gone. And this has barely been a few years. The increasing economic viability of EVs has also made them appeal to many developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil. We are transitioning to solar energy at record speeds. Even Saudi Arabia, of all countries, is making huge leaps towards renewables (now granted whether or not they achieve that is another mystery).

Over half of Europe's energy is already renewable. China is adopting renewable energy at record speeds too with its solar adoption having increased by 1000x since the economic crisis (when the country started caring about solar). California is leading the country with green energy with over half of our energy being from renewables too. It is pretty common to see solar roofs everywhere. Even red states like Texas is adopting wind energy at record speeds. Everywhere around the world we are adopting renewables. Fast.

The fight is still ongoing. We have not defeated it. But the enemy is a mere shadow of what it once was. Self-combusting rivers are no longer a thing. Leaded gasoline aren't in road vehicles anymore. The ozone layer is rapidly recovering after CFCs got banned. Most of the bad stuff in our atmosphere half a century ago is gone. Knowledge of climate change is higher than it has ever been. CO2 emissions have finally plateaued and peaked in 2024. Renewable adoption is happening at speeds we could have never imagined just a few years ago and it is showing zero signs of slowing down.

Maybe we should just stop. Take a breather. And look at everything around us. It isn't as bad as we would like to believe.",1746685951.0,0,66,0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1khjgbo/why_arent_we_celebrating_progress_on_climate/,True,___Cyanide___,1746700543.479018,CO2 emissions,scientific
