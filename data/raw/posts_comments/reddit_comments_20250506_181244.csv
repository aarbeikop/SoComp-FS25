mquiutf,t3_1kfijtv,1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,"You can't tackle everything at once, so pick a few things at a time. A few suggestions for things you can do right now are:

Get rid of plastic in the kitchen. Cutting boards add microplastics to your food, plastic bags break down quickly, containers leech plastic into your food in the microwave. Glass jars are cheap or free storage. Hit the thrift store first. 

Pay attention to what goes down your drain. Aim to capture and use as much water as you can before it goes down the drain. Read the label of cleaning supplies and ask yourself if you really think the chemicals should be in the water.

Recognize where responsibility lies for the problems that were facing. Recycling sounds good, but it was actually intended to keep us happy using more plastic. The plastic industry knew full well that recycling was unworkable, which is a good reason why only about 9% of what we toss in the bin ends up actually recycled.",1746516054.0,8,khyamsartist,1746547956.655624,climate hoax,skeptical
mqug74j,t3_1kfijtv,1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,"Welcome to  the good side.   There are many advances being made in shifting to alternate energy sources, more sustainable choices in food, etc.  It's such a big subject you can look into Universities and legit NGOS for information.  One really excellent book I read that delves into how the corporate world has gaslighted us  is   The Playbook.  How to deny science, sell lies, and make a killing in the corporate world.  By Jennifer Jacquet  Very eye opening and easy to read and discuss.",1746514382.0,3,kulukster,1746547956.659758,climate hoax,skeptical

Unfortunately the impact that one person has is miniscule compared to corporations. So if you have the bandwidth for it, supporting environmentally sustainable policies and politicians is important.


But thank you again for being intentional and building sustainable habits! Actively pushing against the single use mentality is wonderful!",1746527391.0,3,TungstInChic,1746547956.664963,climate hoax,skeptical
mqv9428,t3_1kfijtv,1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,"Cool! Good on your for seeking reality, regardless of the social-costs. 

In terms of literature, I found the Bill Gates; How to Avoid Climate Disaster to be a great introduction to the problem and how society is poised to either solve it or perish. As posited in the book, I am a big proponent of businesses changing, vs. personal consumption changing. I feel as though this sub, and many sustainability movements focus on the personal choices we can make (ie; consumption) vs collaborative and business related efforts. Even if you don't work in oil-n-gas, you can make significantly more impact if you get a business or corporation to alter their strategy in a way that is beneficial for the planet. 

What's beneficial for the planet? If you really want to go deep, come over the Lifecycleassessment sub; where we discuss life cycle analysis; the only quantified method of environmental impact measurment that is universally agreed upon. One has to measure before they can effectively reduce...

The summary of how to make an impact though personally, is consuming less, of everything.

mquv49c,t3_1kfijtv,1kfijtv,sustainability,action-oriented,One of the biggest positive changes you can make for the planet is stop eating beef. As a planet we are destroying millions of acres of rainforest in order to create areas to raise beef. Then the excessive amount of beef creates methane which is 5x more harmful than CO2.,1746524050.0,2,intothewoods76,1746547956.6882281,climate hoax,skeptical
