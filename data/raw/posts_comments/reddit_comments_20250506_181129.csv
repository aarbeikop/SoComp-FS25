Almost no one uses crude oil in any applications.  Instead crude oil is usually distilled and then fed into a catalytic cracker: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking.  

Petroleum refineries burn some of the crude oil in order to create heat and/or pressure.  That means that they produce less products for a given quantity of crude feedstock.  Refineries also often make low value byproducts like petroleum coke.  However, if electricity from photovoltaics is cheap and abundant the refinery can use the electricity to create heat and pressure.  They can also use electrolysis of water or electrolysis of process fluids to produce hydrogen.  Feeding hydrogen gas into the cracker avoids all of the difficulties of storing or transporting hydrogen gas.  Today it is common to use methane as a hydrogen source in petroleum cracking.

We cannot build renewables fast enough to keep up with the MASSIVELY increasing demand for electricity. AND, that's just electricity for households and manufacturing. It doesn't include the fossil fuels we use for shipping, mining, farming, air travel, and heavy industry.

Hell, we haven't stopped BURNING WOOD for energy yet.

""Globally, wood is a significant energy source, particularly in developing countries, accounting for a substantial portion of household energy consumption for cooking and heating. While a precise global percentage is difficult to pinpoint, a considerable amount of wood is burned for energy, with some studies suggesting that half of all wood harvested worldwide is used as fuelwood. In many developing countries, this figure can be as high as 90%.""

Even in the US burning wood accounts for about 4% of energy demand.

After all, if you move to a cabin in the woods, unless it has a solar array, electric heaters, electric water heating, and an electric stove. You are going to burn wood and wood IS as bad as a ""fossil fuel"" in terms of the pollution it causes.

We CANNOT build enough ""renewables"" to provide everyone on earth with a ""US equivalent"" lifestyle.
