The Conditional and Unconditional NDC scenarios which present us with this amount of warming is basically from keeping our current emissions at roughly the same by the middle of the century, but we still can achieve a 2 degree range of warming if we bring our emissions down by roughly 50% by 2050? So if I read this correctly, the headline is slightly misleading and should read as:

""World on pace for 3-4 degrees of warming by 2100 if it doesn't reduce emissions by over half by the middle of the century""

So is this really not new news, or is just the temperature amount being 3+ just news?

Also am I wrong to have assumed it would have warmed between 3-4 degrees because CO2 levels are 400+ ppm, which would be consistent to what occurred during the Pliocene? How is it the planet could be at 400 ppm of CO2 and not be projected to rise by 3-4 degrees?","2019-11-26 18:48:49","9","[deleted]","1747908623.7105944","global temperature rise","manual"

But anthropogenic emissions (caused by humans) “alone are unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5 degrees.” I emphasize that I am not trying to twist the IPCC’s meaning.

Well, he may not have been *trying* to, but he did. [Here's where the quoted portions come from](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/sr15_headline_statements.pdf).  The full quote for the second part:

>>Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high
confidence), but these emissions alone are unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence).

In other words, just based on how much we've increased greenhouse gas concentrations *so far*, if we stopped all emissions immediately, we probably wouldn't reach 1.5 degrees C after all the lags and feedbacks run their course. This is NOT the same thing as saying that continued emissions are not likely to increase temperature by that much. As both that ""summary for policymakers"" and [the full report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SR15_Chapter2_Low_Res.pdf) clearly explain, the models indicate that we have the best chance of limiting future warming to 1.5 degrees (by the year 2100) if we cut emissions nearly in half by 2030, and go net-zero by 2050.

You cannot de-carbonise, and reduce the appetite for carbon (depopulation and the widespread substantial reduction of living standards in the modern world) without inciting monumental levels of violence, genocide and war.

The world will end in a nuclear holocaust before it finds a sustainable environmental solution to climate change. 

The safer policy option is to essentially let nature balance itself; temperatures will rise, and in the same way a body raises it's temperature to rid itself of a virus, it'll massively cull the human population that makes this planet ill. We are in essence at this point, a virus. Once we are gone, carbon will be sucked out of the atmosphere; biodiversity will recover and over thousands of years the planet will flourish again.

A small percentage of humans will survive; the fittest or the elite. Those who have the resources and capital in place NOW, courtesy of raping the environment harder now to cement in place their superiority will have the highest odds of surviving. Those who have access to the height of human technology and the resources to ensure their physical security will be able to leverage it to their advantage and live on. Humans can live in some fucked up conditions and amongst scarcity with far less available to them, so there is no reason billionaires can't leverage the merits of hundreds of years of human civilisation, backed up by many many weapons, and live through the shit.

So lets all take the red pill here, the strongest in society have chosen a modern form of Darwinism as their climate control strategy and their most realistic chance of survival. The rest of us are fucked.","2019-11-07 23:22:42","31","GosuBen","1747909286.1665893","global temperature rise","manual"

"f6v0idt","t3_dt45cx","dt45cx","collapse","skeptical","None of this is astonishing when you imagine it's possible that it's already been decided—geoengineering is the unannounced policy solution to the issue in the U.S.

It may have been before this, but I think this became the de facto shadow resolution at the start of the Obama administration in 2009. I suspected this for some time, but what really convinced me of this nearly 100% was a relatively recent [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZnZP7C7ddA) I heard with [Daniel Schrag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_P._Schrag) from Harvard. Who counts [David Keith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Keith_\(scientist\)) as a colleague there. Keith is heading up one of the largest public geoengineering experiments ever conducted. Schrag's nonchalant nature of addressing the issue as seemingly non-existential was eye-opening. Granted, this is speculation on my part. But remember, Harvard famously hasn't divested their endowment from fossil fuels. 

Schrag was at Harvard when [Lawrence Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers) was the president, and via this relationship, I think it's possible that Summers had an influence on this issue when he was brought in at the start of the Obama administration in 2009 as an economic advisor. Soon after this oil and gas exploration within the U.S. took off unlike anything in decades, with the U.S. now set to overtake Saudi Arabia in terms of output. 

I could very well be wrong in total or in part about this, but many of the choices and decisions made in the last decade make a lot more sense when you realize it's possible that an unannounced geoengineering solution has been shadow U.S. policy.

I know many people already think this is happening via chemtrails. Although, if this is the case they aren't doing a very good job of protecting the Arctic from melting. Albeit, I do think it's possible that unannounced tests have already taken place—and some of the ridiculous quackery found in the chemtrail movement could have been deliberately generated as a means of discrediting any valid investigations or mainstream discussion of the issue. Akin to how Alex Jones makes all conspiracy investigations seem farcical.

Given all this, it increasingly appears we have a choice in what to believe; that the whole world has gone completely crazy in a mad dash to drive human civilization off a cliff. Or some shape of a conspiracy is occurring—and in light of the history of conspiracy on the part of the oil and gas industry over the last century; I lean towards the latter. ","2019-11-08 00:36:08","13","AllenIll","1747909286.172607","global temperature rise","manual"

We are now in a situation where this generation, in fact, in the next few years, is going to have to make a decision of cosmic significance which has never arisen before: Will organized human society survive? And there are two enormous threats. The threat of environmental catastrophe, which at least is getting some attention, not enough. The other is the threat of nuclear war, which is increasing sharply by the Trump administration, in fact. These have to be dealt with quickly. Otherwise, there’s nothing to talk about.
