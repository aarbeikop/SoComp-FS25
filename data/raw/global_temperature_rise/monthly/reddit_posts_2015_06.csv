Aerosols from industrial activity play an important role in temporarily cooling the planet. James Hansen called this the [Faustian Bargain](http://www.ecosanity.org/blogsanity/faustian-bargain-david-spratt-climate-code-red):

>…Human activity modifies the impact of the greenhouse effect by the release of airborne particulate pollutants known as aerosols. These include black-carbon soot, organic carbon, sulphates, nitrates, as well as dust from smoke, manufacturing, wind storms, and other sources. Aerosols have a net cooling effect because they reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground and they increase cloud cover. This is popularly known as “global dimming”, because the overall aerosol impact is to mask some of the warming effect of greenhouse gases.

>Hansen’s new study estimates this aerosol “dimming” at 1.2 degrees (plus or minus 0.2°), much higher than previously figured. Aerosols are washed out of the atmosphere by rain on average every 10 days, so their cooling effect is only maintained because of continuing human pollution, the principal source of which is the burning of fossil fuels, which also cause a rise in carbon dioxide levels and global warming that lasts for many centuries…

The average global temperature rise thus far is about 0.85°C since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Once industrial activity ceases and its accompanying aerosols fall out of the atmosphere, the average global temperature will jump to about 2°C, but it won’t simply stop there because there is a [lag time involved with CO2 emissions](http://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html). 

This “committed warming” of past CO2 emissions whose effect will be manifested in the coming [decade(s)](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/co2-emissions-peak-heat-18394) is about [0.6 degrees Celsius](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/climateqa/would-gw-stop-with-greenhouse-gases/). This estimate of ""committed warming"" can also be found with the calculations of the IPCC:

>...So even if carbon emissions stopped completely right now, as the oceans catch up with the atmosphere, the Earth’s temperature would rise about [another 1.1F (0.6C)](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-7.html#10-7-1). Scientists refer to this as committed warming.... - [Link](https://theconversation.com/what-would-happen-to-the-climate-if-we-stopped-emitting-greenhouse-gases-today-35011)

Adding up the current warming of 0.85°C from the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the loss of aerosols with global dimming at 1.2°C, and the “committed” temperature rise from the lag time of CO2 emissions equal to 0.6°C, we get a total of 2.65°C. If all industrial activity and all positive feedbacks ceased today, we would already be committed to 2.65°C, a global average temperature rise of three times what we are currently experiencing. [According to the Climate Accountability Institute, half of all emissions have been produced in the past 25 years.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/20/90-companies-man-made-global-warming-emissions-climate-change) Adding to the warming are numerous self-reinforcing feedback loops which have already been triggered, such as [loss of Arctic albedo](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/08/reflections-on-a-changing-arctic-less-ice-means-faster-warming/). A [recent study](http://www.climatecodered.org/2014/02/arctic-sea-ice-loss-adds-25-to-carbon.html) calculated that the loss of Arctic ice reflectivity from 1979 to 2011 added an amplifying feedback to human warming equivalent to 25% of the heat captured by CO2 emissions during that same time.

The following will not be considered at the next UNF Convention on Climate Change in December of this year:

* Exponential decline of Arctic Sea Ice and the resultant catastrophic changes in weather patterns as well as methane venting

* The observed changes in Jet Streams and weather patterns, critical for modern agriculture, that are causing megadroughts and massive floods

* The imminent threat of a world food crisis triggered by the prior two manifestations of anthropogenic climate change

* Accurate projections for sea level rise since the latest findings of ice melt from Greenland and Antarctica will not be considered

We have shifted the dense, concentrated fossil carbon from beneath the earth back into the air, where it has been entering the carbon cycle [at least 135 times greater than volcanic eruptions](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/climate.php), disrupting the balance of the carbon cycle to which life has evolved on this planet. The CO2 we have emitted will [last for thousands of years](http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html) and the earth won't reach a temperature equilibrium with current CO2 levels for many centuries, so warming will continue through that time. We've already raised CO2 in the air over 43% from the natural peak of 280 ppmv. So slow are geological processes that it will take 500 years for a fifth of that CO2 to settle out, 30,000 years or more for half of that excess to go back underground, and 100,000 years for it all to return to its natural state[(1)](http://www.climate-change-knowledge.org/carbon_dioxide.html). [We have emitted enough CO2 to negate the next ice age that would have occurred 50,000 years from now.](http://press.princeton.edu/TOCs/c8719.html)

We have entered a major climate disruption unlike anything humans have ever known, one of sudden shifts in weather patterns and sea levels, of plant distribution and the spread of flood, drought, and wastelands. Not all the changes will always be gradual since tipping points and sigmoid curves are the rule in complex systems. Black swan events, turbulence and chaos come out of external forcings like the fossil carbon dumping humans are creating. Some of the change from the natural world to the world we have made will happen as sharp, steep steps, both costly and painful. In any one day, year or decade, the changes may be small, but they accumulate and move only in one direction.

"38nt2y","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: Pulling the plug: Melting ice and draining lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We’re Laura Stevens and Dr. Sarah Das, glaciologists at MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, here to talk about all things ice! AMA!","Yesterday we published a [paper in Nature on supraglacial lake drainages on the Greenland Ice Sheet](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=50242&tid=3622&cid=217909). Supraglacial lakes form on the surface of the ice sheet during the summer, when temperatures get above freezing in the daytime. In a 2008 study, we discovered that these lakes, some of which are miles wide, can drain in a matter of hours through long cracks known as hydro-fractures that open in the lakebed. These drainage events send a flood of meltwater comparable to Niagra Falls thousands of feet straight down to the bottom of the ice sheet.  The meltwater causes the ice to temporarily speed up, moving more ice to the edge of the ice sheet where it calves off into the ocean as icebergs. It’s important to know where and when lakes will drain in order to predict how fast the ice sheet is moving and how much the ice sheet contributes to sea level rise.  

Since that study in 2008 we have been working hard to figure out what triggers these hydro-fractures, and what that might mean for the future of the ice sheet (and for people elsewhere on the planet) in a warming climate. We do this by traveling every summer to lakes on the ice sheet via helicopter, setting up GPS stations around the lakes, and then using our measurements to observe how the ice sheet surface moves during lake drainage events. We found that enough meltwater gets down to the bottom of the ice sheet before the lake drains to cause the ice sheet surface to be pushed up and stretched. This stretching causes new fractures to form, and once one of those fractures intersects the lake, water from the lake drives the crack open and the lake is history. 

We will be back at 1:00 pm EDT (10:00 am PDT, 5:00 pm UTC) to answer your questions about Greenland lakes, global warming, or the life of a scientist doing research on the ice sheet. AMA! 

EDIT: Thanks, everyone for your questions. We're signing off now. You gave us a lot to think about next time we're out on the ice. Until then, you can keep up with recent information about glaciers and ice sheets here.[](http://www.whoi.edu/main/topic/glaciers-ice-sheets)
