"8uqjw3","climatechange","action-oriented","Is deforestation more urgent than global warming?","**This is a question on the IELTS test**

While some people consider global warming to be the most pressing environmental problem which we have at the moment, others believe that deforestation has a more devastating impact on our world. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.  


**This is my response**

Some people think that climate change should be addressed first, whereas others propose that deforestation takes on greater urgency. Although each side makes a valid point, I would argue that both are important issues that must be addressed in our generation.

Those who favor climate change may argue that rising temperature will make our planet uninhabitable. The emission of CO2-gases trap heat from the sun, creating the well-known ""green-house effect."" If such changes are unchecked, the ramifications can be enormous. Rising tides will reshape our coastlines. Large areas near the ocean will be rendered uninhabitable. Were this to happen, coastal cities must redefine their coastlines and create infrastructure that controls flooding. Global warming also creates unpredictable weather patterns. Large-scale hurricanes and typhoons will continue to scourge us and our children if temperatures continue to rise. The heat itself can also threaten our health, as the 2003 heatwave in Europe has clearly demonstrated. The effect of global warming cannot be overlooked.

On the other hand, those who favor deforestation also have a point to make. They argue that diminishing forest area will mean the extinction of species, many of which are yet to be discovered. These uncatalogued species can potentially hold the key to treating certain diseases.  It is anyone's guess how many ""penicillins"" are yet to be found among them. If these habitats are lost, there will never be another chance to make these discoveries. Deforestation can also adversely affect our climate. Because plants use photosynthesis to convert CO2 to O2, large-scale destruction of forests can throw our fragile system out of balance. With increased CO2 level, this can in turn cause global warming and create a vicious cycle.

With these arguments considered, it is evident that both issues must be seriously looked at. The problems they create and counter-measures we can take are not independent, but inter-related. Therefore, instead of concentrating all our energy to alleviate global warming before deforestation, both should be tackled at the same time. When we create economic incentives to curb clear-cutting, for example, we are not just saving trees, but we are also saving clean air and CO2 absorbers. When we create policies to discourage CO2 emission, we are not just lowering atmospheric temperature, we are creating conditions for forests to thrive, especially those found at warmer and coastal regions.

Having considered the above, I would argue that actions should be taken to address both deforestation and global warming in parallel.","2018-06-29 05:11:56","7","5","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/8uqjw3/is_deforestation_more_urgent_than_global_warming/","True","ChineseZeroToHero","1747888854.4069974","global temperature rise","manual"
