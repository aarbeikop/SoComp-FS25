I then link to sources from the IPCC and NASA to make my points. What can I say to statements like the following that are dismissing these as credible sources?

„IPCC is biased and can not be trusted. They will never come to a different conclusion than AGW because that’s their purpose of existence.“

„IPCC are not scientists, they are politicians with a left and green agenda.“

„Scientist working against AGW are silenced and their funds are cut.“

„These AGW-Scientists are biased because of their fund sources expecting certain outcomes. Unlike for example the Heartland Institute (or the German EIKE) that are telling the truth.“

„Your whole AGW-bubble just burst, as Dr. Mann lost in court. His hockey stick is now officially a fraud and he refuses to make his raw data and methods public.“ (Against this i have this: https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2019/8/28/1881956/-Tim-Ball-Pleads-For-Mercy-As-An-Irrelevant-Sick-Old-Man-Gets-It-Declares-Victory)

„There is still no proof for AGW. They just fail to deliver one, probably because AGW is a hoax.“

„All this climate hysteria is just to come up with new taxes to rip the small citizens off their money.“","2019-09-06 10:32:28","14","98","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/d0euyq/what_can_be_responded_to_these_statements_of_agw/","True","simpleasitis","1747906786.853109","global temperature rise","manual"

I’m not trying to be pessimistic but I just generally want to get an educated answer as to how likely it is that the earth becomes inhabitable before the necessary changes are made. 

I understand that there are many different numbers, dates etc that are thrown around by scientists but if anyone who has a good, realistic insight into my question, I’d love to hear your input.

Climate change, despite still being denied by many, is a well established theory with overwhelming evidence to support it. Climate scientists have been warning governments around the world for decades to take necessary steps to reduce global carbon emissions to avoid climate catastrophe, but so far not enough has been done to combat this major problem.

&#x200B;

**Effects of climate change**

The destabilisation of the climate negatively impacts just about every area of life. Below are three areas of life that are being impacted due to climate change:

**1) Ecosystems**

* **Erosion of the coral reef** \- “experts project that 90% of the world’s reefs will be gone by 2050. Coral reefs are among the earth’s most precious natural resources. They harbor a million species and provide food for 500 million people around the world. But warming waters, pollution and overfishing have badly damaged these precious ecosystems; roughly 50 percent of the world’s corals have been lost in just the last 30 years. [http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/](http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/)
* **Species extinction** \- “Human-caused climate change appears to have driven the Great Barrier Reef’s only endemic mammal species into the history books, with the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lives on a tiny island in the eastern Torres Strait, being completely wiped-out from its only known location. It is also the first recorded extinction of a mammal anywhere in the world thought to be primarily due to human-caused climate change.” [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change)
* **Toxic red tide** \- ""Florida is having a 10-month streak of toxic red tide. This so-called red tide has killed hordes of marine animals and is entering its 10th month of existence—making it one of the longest-lasting cases documented to date...According to Glibert, there are two key factors contributing to this worldwide shift: increasing nutrient run-off from farms, lawns, and other land-based sources, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns occurring as a result of climate change. [https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632)

**2) Social**

* **Water** **shortages**: ""Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought in many parts of the United States and the world in the decades ahead."" [https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/](https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/)
* **Increased** **nutrient** **deficiency**: “**Climate** **change** will make hundreds of millions more people nutrient deficient. Crops grown in a high CO2 atmosphere are less nutritious, containing less protein, zinc and iron” [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient)
* **Increased** **risk** **of** **diseases**: “After West Nile virus kills 22 people in heatwave, experts warn of more mosquito and tick-borne diseases due to climate change...“ [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise)

**3) Energy**

* **Wind** **turbines** \- “Heatwave knocks wind out of onshore turbines” [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp)
* **Hydropower** **dams** \- ""African nations could face devastating blackouts as rising temperatures dry up their hydropower dams. Based on recent years in which extremely dry conditions saw electricity drop off in large areas, a new report by climate scientists has warned that the trend for dam construction may be misguided.” [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html)
* **Nuclear** **power** \- ""Europe’s heatwave, however, hasn’t just increased air temperatures but also water temperatures. Regulations protecting wildlife mean that the usual water sources drawn on by nuclear plants cannot always be used for cooling, leading to shutdowns. It’s not the first time this has happened: Heatwaves forced nuclear shutdowns or curtailments across Europe in 2003, 2006, and 2015. Worse still, scientists warn that thermal power interruptions will worsen because of climate change—not just because of heatwaves but also droughts. It’s ironic that human-induced climate change is threatening a climate-friendly source of electricity.

**How can veganism help**

There are many things an individual can do to reduce their carbon footprint, including: have fewer or no children, recycle more, walk, cycle and use public transport more, use automobiles and planes less, use less electricity, and educate others.  
One of the best ways, that is often not talked about, is to go vegan and switch to a plant-based diet.

>“Which diet is best for the environment? **According to the most comprehensive analysis of farming’s impact on the planet, plant-based food is most effective at combatting climate change**. Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, who led the study, said adopting a vegan diet is “the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth...""

**1) Less water use**

[https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable](https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable)

* About one-third of the world’s water consumption is for producing animal products.
* According to data from the Pacific Institute and National Geographic, a single egg takes 53 gallons of water to produce, a pound of chicken 468 gallons, a gallon of cow’s milk 880 gallons, and a pound of beef 1,800 gallons.
* Growing crops to feed animals killed for food consumes 56 percent of water in the U.S.
* Animal agriculture is responsible for 20 to 33 percent of all fresh water consumption in the world.
* Because animals are so densely packed on today's industrial farms, they produce more manure than can be absorbed by the land as fertilizer. The runoff from these facilities grossly contaminates rivers and ground water.
* Tyson, America’s largest meat producer, is responsible for dumping more toxic pollutants into our waterways than companies like ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical.
* Animal excrement and agricultural runoff have polluted nearly one-third of rivers in the U.S.
* One hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce—the equivalent of two months’ worth of showers.
* A pound of chicken requires 71 percent more water to produce than a pound of soy.

**2) Less pollution**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock operations on land have created more than 500 nitrogen flooded deadzones around the world in our oceans. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of ocean dead zones…water pollution. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**3) Less environmental destruction**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* The meat industry is the cause of 85% of all soil erosion. [https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/)

**4) Less species extinction**

* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction…and habitat destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Up to 137 plant, animal and insect species are lost every day due to rainforest destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**5) Less energy waste**

* “In general, each trophic level relates to the one below it by absorbing some of the energy it consumes, and in this way can be regarded as resting on, or supported by, the next lower trophic level. Food chains can be diagrammed to illustrate the amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to the next in a food chain. This is called an energy pyramid. The energy transferred between levels can also be thought of as approximating to a transfer in biomass, so energy pyramids can also be viewed as biomass pyramids, picturing the amount of biomass that results at higher levels from biomass consumed at lower levels. However, when primary producers grow rapidly and are consumed rapidly, the biomass at any one moment may be low; for example, phytoplankton (producer) biomass can be low compared to the zooplankton (consumer) biomass in the same area of ocean” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic\_level#Biomass\_transfer\_efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level#Biomass_transfer_efficiency)
* “Th**e ten percent law** of transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next can be attributed to Raymond Lindeman (1942), although Lindeman did not call it a ""law"" and cited ecological efficiencies ranging from 0.1% to 37.5%. According to this law, during the transfer of organic food energy from one trophic level to the next higher level, only about ten percent of the transferred energy is stored as flesh. The remaining is lost during transfer, broken down in respiration, or lost to incomplete digestion by higher trophic level.” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological\_efficiency#Ten\_percent\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_efficiency#Ten_percent_law)

&#x200B;

**Summary**

Climate change is real, human activity has been proven to be a major cause, and there are several things you can do to reduce its impact:

1. Have fewer or no children
2. Recycle more
3. Walk, cycle and use public transport more, and use automobiles and planes less
4. Switch to a plant-based diet
5. Use less electricity
6. Educate others
