"e522v30","t3_9bc1q4","9bc1q4","climate","scientific","> I’ll leave you with what seems to me to be a very hopeful alternative. If we could make hydrogen gas (H2) from water (bacteria do it and, on a small scale, we can too), we could take that H2 and burn it with oxygen to make energy and water, which we could remake into hydrogen gas as a never-ending, nonpolluting source of energy. No CO2 in the equation. 

This was something that people looked at quite a bit about 15 years ago.  GM even built a [hydrogen-powered truck for then-governor-of-California Arnold Schwarzenegger to drive](https://newatlas.com/go/3378/), and there were several hydrogen-fueled bus demonstration projects. They generally turned out to be quite expensive to operate, and battery-electric systems have come to dominate the zero-emissions vehicle market.","2018-08-29 20:39:41","2","silence7","1747890901.4618123","global temperature rise","manual"
"e3wrs2t","t3_95zy7n","95zy7n","collapse","skeptical","2 things: first, that graph is for Antarctica, which is the only reliable record we have, mostly from ice cores. The poles (and nighttime lows) are most sensitive to CO2 increases, and poleward temps are already responding to it (the arctic is already 5 C above baseline now) so 10 C above baseline is a reasonable estimate for Antarctica. 
second, planet earth has 3 metastable states, icehouse, interstitial and hot house. we are in interstitial now, moving towards hothouse. once global temps get a few degrees warmer, the feedback loops will abate (the ice will be gone, human populations will dwindle), and a new hothouse state will emerge, where new feedbacks will/should (hopefully) arrest further warming. feedbacks like more cloud cover, increased weathering of rock, and diminishing biological activity/increased carbon burial will slow down the heating. Planet earth, IIRC, has never been more than 8 C warmer than now. More relevant to us, the transition is devastating, but the transition has happened before.","2018-08-09 20:47:51","28","cheeseitmeatbags","1747891084.4208486","global temperature rise","manual"

"e3xvway","t3_95zy7n","95zy7n","collapse","skeptical","That's a global CO2 and a local temp. Not a global temp. 2C will see likely >5C at the poles, due to polar amplification.  So 10C at the poles might be 4 C global ? We're at 1C now, increasing just under 0.2C per decade, that may speed up but there is no sign of that yet.  What it probably won't do is slow down,.

That does not mean we won't see higher global annual spikes, particularly in El Nīno years , it just means the rolling 30 year average is going  up at about 0.2C per decade.

These are very rough numbers.","2018-08-10 09:44:18","6","Capn_Underpants","1747891084.4365027","global temperature rise","manual"

Nobody knows for sure but it doesn't look good.  Read books, papers, watch youtube lectures.  We are *probably* pretty screwed but we have not yet begun to fight!
