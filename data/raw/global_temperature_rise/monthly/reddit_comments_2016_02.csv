Antarctic sea ice surrounds the whole Antarctic continent and spreads Northwards from it. Greenland borders just one part of the Arctic sea ice region. Much of Greenland land ice loss is towards the South of the island, which is actually South of most sea ice formation.

While a lot of people talk about the influence of land ice loss on Antarctic sea ice I don't think it's really been proven that it is the main factor. It probably is contributing but there are other variables.

One is an observed increase in wind speed around the Southern Ocean, where Antarctic sea ice forms. As I understand it this has been proposed to be causing a spreading effect, increasing sea ice extent without much change in ice volume.

It's also suggested that increased wind speed should produce more sea spray aerosol, which enhances cloud albedo in the region with a consequent relative cooling response. I've seen a paper recently indicating observational support for increased cloud condensation nuclei (CCN - essentially aerosol particles which have been used as nuclei for cloud droplet formation. Sea spray is understood to be a major source of CCN in the Southern Ocean) in relation to a period of increased wind speed in the Southern Ocean.

Increased wind speed can also increase downward mixing of energy, such that energy coming into the region is spread out vertically more than the ""normal"", decreasing relative energy availability at the surface. There was a recent paper reporting increased downward mixing of CO2 in the Southern Ocean. It's likely that the same mechanism would also be mixing down more energy away from the surface.","2016-02-22 12:02:04","3","skeeezoid","1747861902.687269","global temperature rise","manual"
"d099yxq","t3_46x9oo","46x9oo","climatechange","action-oriented","Antarctica's land mass is exposed to oceans. The pacific side features the peninsula and [is lower in elevation than the atlantic side](http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/371c/Labs/GIS_Workshop/Spatial_Analysis_An_Antarctic_Example.htm), and the pacific side is much more irregular. The pacific is generally warmer than the atlantic so there are differences in prevailing winds. It adds up to greater variability on the pacific side while the atlantic side continues to steadily mass more ice. 

Concern has been raised over fresh water melt on the pacific side. Fresh water, being lighter, should rest atop the more dense salt water and so form a ready supply for new ice formation. Forming ice from seawater requires the salt to precipitate out so the waters around the freezing areas is a bit more salty than it would be otherwise.That increases the density of the underlying water so the incoming fresh water has greater opportunity to freeze. Consider as well the irregularity of the coast that buffers and shelters newly forming ice against winds and waves that might break it up.

The arctic is subject to a lot more factors owing to the land masses being smaller with much of the ice being over water. Currents move between the islands and winds blow the ice so the movement is chaotic, leading to frequent break-up. Indeed a paper (which I won't reference here) found that the big break up 2 years ago was caused by higher than average winds rather than rising temperatures.

While Greenland features fiords it doesn't have the same large bays as Antarctica. So, the wind and current effects are much greater leading to more breakup. We can see that in the differences between iceberg calving in both regions; the arctic produces many more small bergs than the antarctic and the antarctic features some huge bergs when they escape the bays.

The Arctic's sea ice loss is due largely to black carbon as well as warming temperatures: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=impure-as-the-driven-snow

Antarctica is gaining land ice on the east and losing it on the west.  There are competing hypotheses about why sea ice around Antarctica has increased.  You'll note as well that the majority of people, especially those emitting black carbon, live in the northern hemisphere.","2016-02-22 16:03:20","1","Will_Power","1747861902.6952856","global temperature rise","manual"
