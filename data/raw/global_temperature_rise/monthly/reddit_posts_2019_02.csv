"an3ufp","climatechange","action-oriented","There is no doubt that an increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere causes an increase in global temperatures, but how do we know that the increase in CO2 levels has been the main cause of the increase in Global temperature?","What if increase in CO2 is only responsible for something like 0.01 or 0.05°C of the 1°C rise since 1900. How can we be so sure about such a complex climate system when there are some factors that we don't fully understand yet.

"anibdd","climate","scientific","Michael Mann. Tell me, was he right?","Unfortunately for the deniers of planetary climate change, the ""[scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)"" is unchallengeable.  It's immutable.  And it supports the [scientific consensus ](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/)on global climate change.  Which renders that consensus unchallengeable.  At least by those who respect science and seek the truth ... no matter how inconvenient that truth may be.

The scientific method imposes some very rigid requirements on scientific research and the presentation of the conclusions of scientists, researchers and statisticians.

**The scientific method requires that any theory must make a prediction to be useful.**  A conclusion is not accepted unless the presenter of that conclusion makes a prediction that can be proven (or disproven) by real-world data.  Ultimately, scientists must say,""If this is true, then that will happen"").  Testing that prediction is the single most important element of modernscientific methodology.

Twenty years ago, Michael Mann (and others) presented their famous ""hockey stick"", predicting a rise in the average surface temperature of the planet Earth that was statistically correlated to the increase in the levels of carbon-dioxide in the planet's atmosphere.  

Michael Mann made a prediction.  He published that prediction, and he suffered years of sustained attacks for it.  But ... was he right?

Twenty years later, was he on track?

According to Wikipedia, supported by references provided: 

>More than two dozen reconstructions, using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, have supported the broad consensus shown in the *original 1998 hockey-stick graph.*  
>  
>The 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report cited 14 reconstructions, 10 of which covered 1,000 years or longer, to support its strengthened conclusion that it was likely that Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the 20th century were the highest in at least the past 1,300 years. Over a dozen subsequent reconstructions have supported these general conclusions.

Yeh, Mann was right, and the scientific method, and the scientific consensus on global climate change, are unchallenged.You may as well consider both as ""given"".  Fact.  Incontrovertible.  Immutable.  Truth..

"as4wla","collapse","skeptical","What’s the worst case scenario? 16C temperature rise in 10-20 years, it’s happened before.","60,000 years ago there was a rapid temperature rise of 16C that we can observe in Greenland ice cores. 14,000 years ago the climate warmed 22F in 50 years. Other abrupt warming events occurred 11,000 years ago and 22,000 years ago. 

History shows that when the climate changes, it changes rapidly, most likely due to the tipping points often discussed in this sub. 

The worst case scenario listed in the IPCC report should be read as a moderate scenario. The true worst case scenario, which may be more likely, is 10-20 degrees of warming in a matter of decades.
