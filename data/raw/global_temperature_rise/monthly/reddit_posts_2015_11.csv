"3u2mav","climatechange","action-oriented","Re-examining the 0.6C rise - I've changed my position.","In discussion with u/pocketfrog77 I’ve come to realize that the contention of an actual temperature rise of 0.6C doesn’t hold up, that we’re closer to the mark at 0.7C. 

1880 has been taken as a common, formal, start-date for discussion. That has been held constant both in published literature and on sites such as WUWT. But 1880 does not seem to be representative of the early part of the last century:

http://woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1860/to:1910/mean:12/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1860/to:1910/mean:12/trend:12

See from the above that the global average hovered ~0.3 below the HadCrut baseline. As such I feel that it’s more realistic than the 1880 single point of -0.2.  Therefore, in all further discussions I, for one, will be using what I feel is the more realistic figure of **0.7C** to describe the modern temperature increase. I invite other skeptics to re-examine the data and perhaps adopt that figure as well.

Ok a simple question. Will their be another ice age?.

( clue the answers yes BTW) 

We as a species have been here for a tiny tick of a clock that has been running since the big bang.

We like the dinosaurs and other species will disappear in less than another tick. At any given time the ground you are standing on has been molten lava or half a mile deep under an ice sheet and everything in between.

This will keep happening,the warming and freezing cycle of this planet will carry on way beyond any trace of humans or our descendants.

If you dispute any of these facts feel free to explain that to me.

If we have an input into this natural cycle it will not stop it happening.

During the last ice age the population of the earth compressed towards the equator,during the warming since, it has expanded towards the poles.

This is a cycle that will keep repeating if we are here or not. 

During warming the land available to farm gets bigger,food sources become more plentiful,humans grow healthier and live longer.

In general warming is a good thing for the majority of life on the planet.

So i ask once more. Will their be another ice age? when you realize the answer is yes and that we are in a planetary cycle, you might get a bit more perspective and worry about more important things we can control ,starvation, disease.poverty for example.

Feel free to use any spelling or grammar errors to negate any points i have made without having to dispute the facts. ;]

EDIT:

NOAA data is proven biased.hint google ""NOAA bias"" it is a warmist site.got any more proof?.
I am in noway saying warming is not happening or possible but that it is SUPPOSED to as part of a cycle.

Milankovitch cycles  prove it is certain that the world will go into an ice age which will ""solve"" any ""issues"" we have now.we are lucky to be alive between ice ages.

Climate change is not changing in decades at all, a max 1(ONE) degree increase globally in a hundred years, no increase in the last 16 years.

The arctic will be ice free, nope never happened. glaciers growing in greenland, antartica not shrinking, not a single low lying island has sunk beneath the waves.

This crusade has been going on how long now?, and for who's benefit?.

Yes seas will rise and fall, temperatures will rise then fall, you ground you stand on has been molten lava and under half a mile of ice or at the bottom of a deep sea over the last billion years.

This is the natural cycle of this planet.

Spending billions of dollars on this is  a waste of time and money that could be spent making a difference to real people in need right now.

So far not a single reply has accepted that the cycle of ice ages and warming periods is real and accept that they will continue, why i wonder? It was a yes no question.

That is denial imo.

If one percent of the time and money spent on this global warming\climate change crusade had been spent on disease management or anti poverty measures it would have had a massive effect on those issues.
