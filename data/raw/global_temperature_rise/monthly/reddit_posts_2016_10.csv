"564q7i","climatechange","action-oriented","Are rising temperatures a global or local phenomenon?","As I understand, global warming is the conclusion that our atmosphere is warming based on average measurements of surface temperature around the planet.

Is it reasonable to assume that this average value is consistent with a change in global climate, or is it a localised phenomenon above land masses with high volume emissions?

For example, is the temperature increasing consitently at the poles and the equator?","2016-10-06 10:25:49","3","6","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/564q7i/are_rising_temperatures_a_global_or_local/","True","Bjehsus","1747869435.209249","global temperature rise","manual"
