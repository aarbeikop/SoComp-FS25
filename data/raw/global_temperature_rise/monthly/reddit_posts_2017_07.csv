I'll first begin with some ideas and facts that are the root of my train of thought.

Earth is nearly a closed system, meaning everything on it comes from Earth and just changes form. From your bed sheets to your iPhone. They are made up of parts that at some point came from the earth. 

The earth goes through cycles. At one point Colorado was under water. At some other point we had a snow ball earth, the ice ages, everything was covered in ice.

Human have dramatically changed natural processes on earth. We tear up the land, destroy forests, and create pollution.

Pollution creates an ozone layer due to green house gases and warms the earth.

CO2 is a green house gas.

CO2 is stored in various parts of the earth. Air, land, and ocean. 

The ocean is our largest CO2 reservoir, but it had a limit of how much it can hold and once it reaches that limit the excess CO2 will be forced to go elsewhere.

Something about plankton being able to reduce CO2 in oceans.

Global Warming is scary because it raises temperatures and melts ice caps causing sea levels to rise.

Many people will be affected by seal level rises (lightly put).

The earths surface is made up of a rigid and brittle layer called the lithosphere which lies above the fluid asthenosphere. Plate tectonics, subduction, renewal of crust, mid ocean ridges, etc. Essentially, land sinks into the earth, is melted down into magma, the heat causes an increased in buoyancy and this magma rises one again as new crust. 

Of course it is way more complicated than that because there are heavier elements that don't always come back up due to their density. And then there's crustal assimilation and a bunch of other science. 

Looking at these very rough ""facts"", (Im no expert, some info could be incorrect), it seems that earth has undergone lots of crazy shit. I'm not too sure if we are the worst but we definitely are the only ones to really affect natural processes. 

The sea level will rise due to global warming, global warming has been ""sped up"" by humans.
But sea level changes and temperature fluctuations are all things that have happened to Earth in the past. 

My personal thoughts:
In the very distant future the earth will completely renew itself because of plate tectonics. Everything man made will eventually be subducted, melted back down into magma, sorted by density, mineral composition, atomic structure, etc. We will no longer exist and the earth could be inhabited by a revolutionized species that can tolerate earths increase in temperature. Sounds far fetched. But if you told the dinosaurs that roamed the earth for millions of years that everything will be covered in naked, scaleless, creatures, with extremely high resourcefulness that have defied natural selection and the fittest don't always survive, they would probably eat you because they don't understand what you're saying. 

The main point I'm trying to make is we cannot stop it. This is earth's cycle. It was here before us and it will be here long after we all die. We are a bigger threat to ourselves and the species that live among us than we are to the Earth. 

Humans are so self centered that we are victims of our own creations. We believe that because millions of people will be affected by sea level rise that we are destroying our earth. Ice caps are melting! If Earth is a closed system the amount of water (solid, liquid gas (okay the amount of H2O)) is nearly fixed--then at some point when North America was under the sea that there must have been very little ice caps.

The past is simply repeating, the only difference is that it is affecting our lives. People think if you put the focus on Earth being a victim it will get more attention. Humans have sympathy for innocence and in many eyes, the Earth is an innocent provider and we are taking advantage of it because we are devilish greedy bastards.

End of rant.
