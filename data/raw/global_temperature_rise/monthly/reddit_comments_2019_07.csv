So are they claiming that low level cloud cover decreased but no one else noticed it!

""In Figure 2 we see the observed global temperature anomaly (red) and global low cloud cover changes (blue). These experimental observations indicate that 1 % increase of the low cloud cover fraction decreases the temperature by 0.11°C.""

So, if we assume that the change in temperature is due solely to changes in global low cloud cover, we can conclude that CO2 is not significantly contributing to the change in temperature! What a surprise. Also, note that their equation 1 for global temperature only includes two variables, low cloud cover and CO2. According to them, nothing else has any effect on global temperature, including solar insolation.

Man made global warming may be very real but Co2 might not be the culprit after all. 

I’m not saying this because I think we should keep burning fossil fuels, business as usual from now until the oil runs dry- I despise the oil companies and the pollution created by burning this stuff is no doubt hurting the planet but I have my doubts that the Co2 being produced by humans is making it warmer to any significant degree. It seems to me that this Co2 tunnel vision has diverted a lot of attention away from environmental issues that are much more pressing than a gas that has always been in our atmosphere that is essential for plants to survive and flourish (which is essential for us to survive and flourish). 

The origins of global warming are worth looking into, if you haven’t already, in terms of who came up with this concept and what other agendas they may have had.

A 10 year old story written by Booker a man with zero scientific background and a host of wacky views on scientific issues like Dawinian evolution. Since this was published the Berkeley Earth team have done a rigerous review of the time series and shown the same broad conclusions 

 [http://berkeleyearth.org/data/](http://berkeleyearth.org/data/) 

And the satellite data shows the same broad conclusions. 

More over no analysis of the temperature data has shown anything other the same broad conclusions. 

> Since 2003, however, when the statistical methods used to create the ""hockey stick"" were first exposed as fundamentally flawed by an expert Canadian statistician[ **Steve McIntyre**](http://www.climateaudit.org/) 

Steve McIntyre has moved from climate change and now his blog spends most of its time trying to prove the ""white helmets"" off Syria were all secret jihadis and that the Russian backed regime are the good guys. The over view of late Holocene temperature evolution is broadly where Mann thought it was in the late 90s, virtually no highly cited papers have emerged to show otherwise. 

Journalists and bloggers with long histories of fringe science and conspiracy theories but who have never published their own work showing what the supposed true time series of either global surface temperature or late Holocene temperatures are not really people I would lend much credibility too. 

I have a pretty good grounding in the history of science. I can say that you only really over turn theories or data by showing better ones, not by snide articles about some secret supposed conspiracies.

Most of those who turn a blind eye don’t truly know the problem, it doesn’t effect them. If this information and the reliability of so many of these resources and ecosystems was presented to mankind showing how it sustains human life it would become more important. Mankind truly destroys all it comes in contact with, it’s a sad reality, but it’s the truth. There is more potential in the world. I’ve had it told to me many times that Homo sapiens are the only species that can think about long term future gains. The example is with the study on chimpanzees, I believe. Researchers have placed food inside a basket (something a monkey would want to eat, obviously) and let the monkey try to get it out through the gaps and openings in the basket. Monkeys apparently only think of the now rather than the long term sustainability of not eating whatever’s in the basket for the sake of using your hand to its full potential. I think even as a human species our long term processing only goes so far and in the long run decisions are made that benefit us in the now as opposed to long term sustainability of the very resources keeping us alive.","2019-07-01 23:19:24","4","ashleybrantner","1747905710.6389697","global temperature rise","manual"
