**“The data doesn’t matter. We’re not basing our recommendations on the data. We’re basing them on the climate models.”–Prof. Chris Folland, Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research**

and

**“We need to get some broad based support, to capture the public’s imagination… So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts… Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.” — Prof. Stephen Schneider, Stanford Professor of Biology and Global Change**.
