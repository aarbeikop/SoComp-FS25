"cwvs3qx","t3_3sbgub","3sbgub","climate","scientific","Your point is pretty contradictory: You want us to worry more about things like starvation, disease and poverty, while ALL these issues are certain to be impacted **heavily** by climate change. It's especially the world's poorest nations (in which starvation, disease and poverty are the biggest issues) that will be hit the hardest by climate change.

I would recommend a read in the [IPCC AR5 WG2 report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/).
And another interesting article on [economic performance under climate change](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-21/climate-change-slams-global-economy-in-new-study-from-stanford-and-berkeley).

Climate has changed in the past, of course, but in this case, it's human forced warming bringing about abrupt climate change.

Is it ""good"" for life on earth? Well that's a subjective thing. But life will probably evolve around it, while there will be a mass extinction. Problem is, again, humans are pretty shitty at evolving. As is all the food we eat (which, even if you're a vegan, all come from living things, which are also all affected by climate and weather).

That depends. What causes ice ages?

> In general warming is a good thing for the majority of life on the planet.

Even if that were true, what is the moral case against attempting to protect the minority that will be harmed by warming? If warming the planet will cause some species to go extinct, and we are causing the planet to warm, is that morally justifiable?","2015-11-10 20:57:19","2","JRugman","1747859119.7347171","global temperature rise","manual"

The OP wrote
""Climate change is not changing in decades at all""

You have absolutely no clue about the science of anthropogenic global warming.

""The first nine months of 2015 comprised the warmest such period on record across the world's land and ocean surfaces, at 0.85°C (1.53°F) above the 20th century average, surpassing the previous records of 2010 and 2014 by 0.12°C (0.21°F). Seven months this year, including the past five, have been record warm for their respective months. January was the second warmest January on record and April third warmest.""

You mean the Milankovitch cycles that are so easy to find via Google????

Perhaps only you understand these cycles? Did you look into the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere during those cycles as compared to today's levels?
