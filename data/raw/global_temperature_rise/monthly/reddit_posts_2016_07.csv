Based on the 20th Century global average temperature, I wanted to know, how long will it take for a 1 degree C rise?

Averaging the anomalies, I came up with these numbers.

If you average the anomalies from 2001 to 2016, it would take 45 years for us to increase the global temp one degree C. But if the latest years are indicative of an actual a trend, we are now on course to increase global temperatures by one degree every 2 to 5 years.

* 2001-2016 - 1 degree C every 45 years
* 2007-2016 - 1 degree C every 20 years
* 2012-2016 - 1 degree C every 5 years
* 2015-2016 - 1 degree C every 1.7 years

Here's the data: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/global/globe/land_ocean/ytd/6/2000-2016

Am I reading this wrong?
