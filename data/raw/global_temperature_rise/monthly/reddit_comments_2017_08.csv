"dlbzkzp","t3_6sbwte","6sbwte","climatechange","action-oriented","Sure. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are transparent to visible light, but opaque to certain bands of infrared. Some of the visible light from the sun hits the Earth's surface and is absorbed (the rest is reflected), where it is reemitted as infrared. The concern with global warming is that GHGs will prevent some of this infrared from escaping into space.

When we talk about cooling scenarios, the concern is with particulate matter that reflects away some of the incoming visible light from the sun. I hope that helps.","2017-08-08 15:10:55","3","Will_Power","1747879275.199385","global temperature rise","manual"
