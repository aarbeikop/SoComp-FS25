"csib3na","t3_3b2vvg","3b2vvg","environment","emotional","While there is general consensus that the Earth is committed to an increase in global average temperatures (surface, air, water) even if anthropogenic emissions were discontinued today, many of the factors you mention have large error bars.

Aerosol forcings and cloud feedbacks, in particular, are poorly constrained. Other feedbacks, such as GHG releases from permafrost melting, are even less understood. So I'm not saying you're right or wrong, but rather that carrying the temperature rise to two decimal places is implying a precision that doesn't exist.  ; ]

Nonetheless, your estimate is probably in the ballpark.

2.  If this were to happen and it wasn't tied to an event that we were aware of, meaning not from a ship fire, or volcanic eruption, are there agencies or methods in place that would alert us to the sudden increase in ice melting and help mitigate the damage?
