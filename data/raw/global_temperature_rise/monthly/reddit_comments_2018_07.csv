"e24uje2","t3_8wbb7u","8wbb7u","climatechange","action-oriented","There are several datasets in common usage for representing historical change in global average surface temperature since the 19th Century. The most common are: HadCRUT4, NOAA MLOST, GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, Cowtan & Way. There are two basic methods of obtaining a figure representing the total change since the beginning of the record: 1) finding the linear trend slope through the data and multiplying by the number of years 2) Taking the difference between an average of the most recent few years (say, a decade 2008-2017) and an average (say, 20 or 30 years) around the beginning of the record.

Here's a comparison between records for each method. Note that some records start in 1880, some 1850. The difference method uses either 1850-1879 or 1880-1909. All have 2017 as the last year.

|Record name (start date)|Warming - linear trend|Warming - difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|HadCRUT4 (1850) |0.85ºC|0.87ºC|
|NOAA MLOST (1880)|0.95ºC|0.94ºC|

|Berkeley Earth (1850)|1.07ºC|1.06ºC|
|Cowtan & Way (1850)|0.92ºC|0.95ºC|

Both methods are probably slightly underestimating the true current amount of warming. The linear method because the rate of warming has increased over time so a linear trend over the whole period does not properly represent recent warming. The difference method because warming is proceeding at a rate of about 0.2ºC/Decade so a 10-year average tends to include years which were quite a bit colder than current.","2018-07-10 16:11:20","1","skeeezoid","1747889640.8402483","global temperature rise","manual"

The IPCC said in AR5 that transient climate response (TCR) is 1.8°C. That means the temperature increase at the time CO2 doubles from an arbitrary staring point. So from 280 ppm to 560 ppm would be one doubling. That might occur towards the end of this century. 

If we use 400 ppm as a starting point (the concentration a couple of years ago), we need to get to 800 ppm to get an additional 1.8°C from now, at the time of doubling. The problem with that, though, is that we don't have enough economically extractable fossil fuel reserves to get to 800 ppm.

"e1rhuhc","t3_8vumdg","8vumdg","climatechange","action-oriented","My off the cuff comments.

I think the biggest wild card for temperature increase is feedback effects associated with Arctic methane deposits. Research suggests that events associated with the PETM (Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum) of 52-53M years ago involved substantial release of these deposits into the atmosphere and resulted in a much hotter (+6C), relatively ice free world. 

Paleo-climate records indicate that current anthropogenic forcing is proceeding much faster than the forcing preceding the PETM, but to this point over a much shorter interval. 

The most important question relating to potential Arctic methane release is how much Arctic temperatures increase. They are well above the global average thus far. 

The 2014 study led by Karen Pistone indicates the loss of albedo in the Arctic alone is thus far providing additional warming of 50% of that associated with cumulative global anthropogenic emissions. 

In a scenario in which there is no significant methane release from the Arctic, then I don't see global average temperature increasing much more than 1.0-1.5C from today's levels this century. My hunch is that annual emissions would peak in 20 years and CO2 would ultimately peak in the 500-550 ppm range before declining. 

It may not sound like a lot, but another 1C from today is a profound jump. That 1C isn't going to be distributed evenly over time and space and the new extremes associated with that should be highly consequential for the quality and diversity for life on earth.

"e1runx7","t3_8vumdg","8vumdg","climatechange","action-oriented","Firstly, you need to define your baseline. In the industrial era we've seen about 1ºC warming already. Some warming projections concern change from now (or from about 2000), some concern change ""since pre-industrial"" (meaning since about 1850), which effectively means change from now + 1ºC.

Based on the CMIP5 models used in the IPCC assessment, warming ""since pre-industrial"" under a high-end minimal-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5) - meaning continued strong growth in energy demand with little change in percentage of that demand satisfied by fossil fuel burning - reaches about 3.5-6ºC by 2100, with the range largely due to uncertainty in climate sensitivity.

Under a strong mitigation scenario - meaning drastic reduction in emissions starting now - warming ""since pre-industrial"" reaches about 1-2.5ºC by 2100.

Beyond 2100, under a high-end scenario in which emissions only begin to reduce at a gradual pace around the mid-22nd Century (due to resource shortages rather than mitigation), warming ""since pre-industrial"" reaches about 6-15ºC by 2300. Under the strong mitigation scenario 2300 temperatures are about 1-2ºC warmer than pre-industrial.

As another comparison, under a minimal-mitigation low-end scenario (RCP6.0) - in which emissions start slowing from 2070 and GHG concentration stop increasing at 2150, there is only one model that I can find which was run to 2300. Luckily that model is right in the middle of the range for climate sensitivity. By 2100, warming ""since pre-industrial"" reaches 3.5ºC. By 2300 it's at 4.5ºC. Using the other results we can make an educated guess at equivalent uncertainty ranges of 2-5ºC and 2.5-7ºC respectively.

Should note that none of these model projections include so-called Earth System Sensitivity (ESS) feedbacks, such as ice sheet albedo loss and carbon cycle shifts, which paleoclimate observations suggest should enhance warming in the long run. Probably not important for 2100, but likely to be for 2300 and beyond.","2018-07-04 11:47:38","1","skeeezoid","1747889776.4502356","global temperature rise","manual"

"e2w2m26","t3_9147zw","9147zw","climatechange","action-oriented","Well, this is an absurdly didactic way of making a point. Here's my attempt to reframe a similar observation in a less-didactic way.

Through most of industrial history, the combustion of fossil fuels has had a very tight relationship with economic growth. You could say that because of the exceptional energy density of fossil fuels, one of the byproducts of burning one unit of fuel (along with emitting one unit of CO2) is a one-unit reduction in global poverty.

One of the tasks included in climate remediation is uncoupling this fairly tight relationship between fossil-fuels/CO2-emissions and economic growth. 

And it's happening now. I'm not aware of any rigorous studies on this question, but if they don't exist now then eventually they will. Currently I believe it's possible to sustain small sections of an average economy on a minimum-CO2-emissions basis. Consider a small upcountry agricultural town in a middle-income country like Malaysia, where there's basically no demand for heavy machines or air travel: You might be able to meet everyone's energy needs with renewable energy and electric vehicles. 

As technology improves, these low-emissions regions of the world economy will get larger. And presumably richer as well, since the demand for economic growth probably won't lessen in our lifetimes. 

But it's going to take several decades to break this link substantially. It's a gigantic task, and technology has many milestones to pass before the energy density of fossil fuels — which is so crucial for heavy machines and industrial applications — can be replicated with low-emissions methods. 

In the meantime, global poverty reduction and economic growth are still going to be largely driven by CO2-emitting processes. It's definitely a cost worth accepting, if you consider poverty reduction and wealth production to be indispensable parts of a morally acceptable future. But the costs of CO2 reduction will have to be paid sometime — most of them probably when technology enables CO2 reduction without undermining efforts at poverty reduction and economic growth. 

It will happen. It's just going to take a long time, and possibly even today's students won't see the arc completed in their lifetimes. This is basically another Industrial Revolution, and it's reasonable to think it will require at least a full human lifetime to complete.","2018-07-23 15:56:58","2","DocHarford","1747889814.8755057","global temperature rise","manual"
