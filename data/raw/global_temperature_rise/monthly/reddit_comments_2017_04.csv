The entire climate system is very complex, so it is true that ""climate models cannot model the past"" if you are expecting a 100% accurate depiction of every single event in earths history. However, climate models do a very good job of showing trends and phenomena that occurred in the past. One example of this is the African Humid Period, which occurred 6-12 thousand years ago when the Sahara desert was a grassland. Climate models do not recreate the large magnitude of precipitation and vegetation that we know occurred based on sediment evidence, and this is likely because there are so many feedbacks between vegetation, dust, the ocean, etc. that it is nearly impossible to capture every part of the climate system in the models. However, climate models do predict much more precipitation and lead to a vegetated Sahara, so when you look at the type of environment that they display, they did get it right. This example shows that even though we can't get models to perform with 100% accuracy, they are extremely informative in showing us past environments and climates. 

When you point that towards future climate change, the same holds true. Climate models cannot tell us that Miami will experience a large hurricane on September 15, 2078, but they can tell us what the average climate will be like in 2078 if we continue to add greenhouse gases to the environment. Based on physical relationships in the climate, we know that carbon dioxide warms the earth so by changing the amount of it in the atmosphere we can predict with high accuracy how much warmer the average temperatures on earth will be. 

Lastly, the claim that warming disappears when models are improved is unfortunately false. There is a very high degree of certainty that climate models underestimate the future warming that will occur on earth. This is why it is vital that we as a country take action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before our climate zone becomes even more different from the ""normal"" that our human societies were built to withstand.

First, that is not true. After the slowdown in warming during the 2000's(what deniers call the hiatus) there were a few papers that lowered the projected warming, but as we experienced the first 3 yeas of consecutive record hot years those lower estimations are proving to be way off.

Second it is not just about temperatures. Look for example at ice. Most land glaciers are retreating, Antarctica is melting from below, and Arctic sea ice is at record low levels and decreasing.

While we have ice sheets, total warming will be absorbed by melting ice, but as the ice disappears that effect disappears. This not only changes the albedo of the planet, it changes water cycles, temperatures cycles and atmospheric cycles etc.

I think your friend has not looked at the data honestly and is only repeating the typical denier talking points. ","2017-04-26 14:35:08","4","Archimid","1747875599.14071","global temperature rise","manual"

The biggest group of people misrepresenting AGW are those that are overconfident of their own knowledge and expertise, going as far as demonstrating full [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect).

Anyway there are a HUGE lot of things that can be discussed here, and the excellent example with the African Humid Period that is already discussed is just one of them, I would add:

- our knowledge of the past climate is far from perfect, and you will see very often AGW-deniers claiming one moment that we know perfectly the past climate and the models are not able to mimic that, and than switch to the complete opposite where they claim that reconstructions of past climate are complete garbage

- even if models are not perfect in this regard this should not be a reason to dismiss AGW as a significant problem, on the contrary the models have almost always been wrong on the side of being too conservative and ""smoothing"" the extreme changes, so if the models are wrong about the future it is at least as likely that things will actually be worse than what the models currently predict - you can already see that with the [Arctic Sea Ice Extent](https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/ice-models-reality.jpg) and with the sea level rise, where [models keep being corrected only upwards towards higher and higher values](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25042017/arctic-sea-ice-climate-change-global-warming-sea-level-rise-ipcc).","2017-04-26 17:58:01","3","outspokenskeptic","1747875599.1437101","global temperature rise","manual"

I worked as a researcher for several years and encountered this sort of thing occasionally. What generally worked best for me when dealing with scientists who don't understand something outside their direct field is to demand evidence from them. Then, provide your own to get a fuller picture, and have them come up with their best explanation for the evidence available.","2017-04-26 23:39:52","3","hammertime84","1747875599.1457083","global temperature rise","manual"
