mountain glaciers and rivers will start to disappear and mountainous regions will see more landslides, as the permafrost that held them together melts away.

Sea levels could rise by a metre, displacing 10% of the world's population. Countries such as the Maldives will be submerged and the Indian subcontinent will be left fighting for survival. People will also die in greater numbers as they struggle with the increasing heat.

The ecosystem will collapse and a third of all life on earth will face extinction. Plant growth will slow, then stop. Plants don't absorb carbon dioxide very well so begin to emit it - making global warming worse.

The world's food centres will become barren and one third of the planet will be without fresh water.

3 ℃ - 
up to 40% of the Amazon rainforest will be destroyed and warmer soil will kill vegetation and release more carbon.

Hurricanes will be stronger and cities in Asia, Australia and the south-east of the US will face destruction. Holland will be torn apart by the North Sea.

Saltwater will creep upstream, poisoning the groundwater and ruining the food supply.

4 ℃ - 
millions of people will begin to flee coastal areas, cities will begin to vanish and some will become islands.

The ice at both poles will vanish over time and this could see a rise in sea levels of as much as 50m, although this may take hundreds or thousands of years.

China, a major producer of the world's rice, wheat and maize, could see its agriculture fail - it will need to feed more than a billion people on two-thirds of its current harvest.

Summers will be longer and soaring temperatures will see forests turn to firewood, with even Britain's south reaching 45 ℃. The increased demand on air-conditioning puts massive pressure on the country's power grid.

5 ℃ higher in the oceans - 
frozen methane hydrate from the seabeds will gasify and ascend to the atmosphere. 
Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and may cause an extra temperature rise of 4-5 ℃ over time. 

6 ℃ - 
rainforests will be deserts and massive numbers of migrants will flock to the few parts of the world they see as inhabitable, resulting in racial conflict and civil war.

Many will choose places such as Canada and Siberia but even those climates may be too hot to grow food.

Stagnant oceans mean more hydrogen sulphide, which kills the sea-life and, if the sea heats up enough, massive stores of methane hydrate under the sea will begin to escape.

Methane is flammable and the smallest spark or lightning strike could see fireballs tearing across the sky. 

10 ℃ - is generally accepted as a figure able to cause truly global mass extinction.

"e6fz60","climatechange","action-oriented","What should we do in the long term","I'm going to preface this by saying I do believe climate change is real, and I do believe human activity can have an influence on climate, through CO2 emissions.

However, we also know that there have been cyclical ice ages in the past and in such times the planet gets about 3 km deep ice sheets covering a huge chunk of North America, North Europe etc. There were also times when the ice went pretty much all the way down to the equator. When it is this cold, life doesn't do great on planet earth. I would hate to live during an ice age. I think it is no coincidence civilization started to develop when the last ice age ended.

We also know that there have been times, between ice ages, when it was much hotter than it is now. Mammals tend to do quite well when it is hotter and so do plants. 

My question is - assuming we get to a point where we are better at influencing the climate and we can actually control it, what should we do? Do we keep it at a steady temperature, forever, say the current one? Should we interfere if an ice age is coming and we can prevent it? Should we make it hotter if it means we can free up more habitable space than we lose and we needed such space?","2019-12-05 11:34:09","1","10","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e6fz60/what_should_we_do_in_the_long_term/","True","GloomyHold","1747909597.6033487","global temperature rise","manual"
"ef13aa","climatechange","action-oriented","Human Emissions Quantities Sources","Hey all, I've recently been diving into the scientific evidence behind Global Warming and Climate Change and have found a lot of good sources.  One item I keep seeing is claims that human activities are the major cause since around the 60's where data shows an increase in the rate at which the average annual temperature is rising, where natural sources would indicate a global cooling.  This appears to be one of the items specifically pointing to human activities causing the net warming in recent decades/the past century.

Is anyone familiar with some sources/studies that I could check out emphasizing the quantities of emissions/greenhouse gases produced by Human Activities.  I am interested in learning how this is measured and what observed values have been published.","2019-12-24 13:02:59","7","2","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ef13aa/human_emissions_quantities_sources/","True","RafikiRogers","1747909616.3055623","global temperature rise","manual"

Stefan Rahmstorf is a climate hero who first presented a chart saying emissions must go down 50% in 10 years at the [2017 AGU meeting](https://youtu.be/7i2k2tpbfVk?t=357). His presentation was followed by Michael Mann saying renewables will save us.

"e60fh0","environment","emotional","Avoiding 1.5°C increase in global temperatures seems extremely difficult, if not impossible.","Here's a news piece from the 31 January 2019 Nature magazine word for word:

>**Per capita carbon emissions must fall to 1955 levels**  
>  
>Gregg Marland, Tom Oda & Thomas A. Boden  
>  
>**The findings of the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report imply that we need to reduce global emissions of carbon dioxide within 12 years to where they were 41 years ago, to avoid a 1.5 °C increase in average Earth surface temperature.** Global emissions and concentrations are still rising, however, so temperatures continue to go up.  
>  
>Our estimates show that emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement manufacture in 2017 surpassed 10 gigatonnes of carbon (see [go.nature.com/2teyafi](http://go.nature.com/2teyafi)). Population growth is partly responsible. In 1977, when the global population was 4.23 billion, emissions per capita were 1.19 tonnes of carbon per person. By 2017, this had increased to 1.34 tonnes (the global population that year was 7.55 billion). **So, decreasing total emissions to the 1977 figure will mean returning per capita emissions to those recorded for 1955.**  
>  
>Growth in industrialization and population distributions also increase carbon emissions. Emissions are still high from countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany, which industrialized early. Top emitters now also include China, India, Iran, Brazil and South Africa. The distribution within countries is also changing as urbanization and transportation increase (see [go.nature.com/2hwpia3](http://go.nature.com/2hwpia3)).  
>  
>We need to make drastic changes in carbon emissions, soon. This means widespread global cooperation and unprecedented commitment.
