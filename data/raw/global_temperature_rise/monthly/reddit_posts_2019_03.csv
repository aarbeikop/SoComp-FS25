For example, news about the fauna and other rise in average temperature don't have a negative impact on people's live because they might not be science-litterate, and it might not change how they eat and consume.

What are the first events or of the most obvious signs that people will notice that are caused by global warming?

PS: my question was both removed in /r/askscience and /r/explainlikeimfive

I'm looking for an realist, scientific, ""alarmist"" but not paranoiac ""doom and gloom"" answer. I've heard nobody can really answer how human society will answer to problems and where it's going to result in crisis, since there are butterfly effects.","2019-03-09 10:26:35","677","258","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/az25ki/what_are_the_first_things_caused_by_global/","True","PenisShapedSilencer","1747897000.5643642","global temperature rise","manual"
"awhmyq","climate","scientific","Fear, Hopelessness and How to Proceed","So, I am fairly new to the discussion on climate change, only really diving into the details about a week ago, but once I saw the truth and how terrible our future could/will be, I couldn’t look away. I have nightmares, I can’t get it out of my head, enough to even focus. I’m only in college and yet I feel like I have no possible live afterwards. It’s anger inducing, to say the very least.

My question is, how should I live? I’ve already decided to make the most out of the “normal life” I have left by getting in touch with my friends, family and other relationships so I feel my life hasn’t been completely wasted. At first, I was looking into moving up north to Michigan/Canada but I don’t even think that’s gonna do anything. It’s hard to focus on anything else, but the main thing is, I’m afraid of the suffering I’ll face, the slow, painful death I’ll experience in a rather short amount of time. I just want to ask, what should I do? Sorry if this has been asked before, still fairly new to Reddit ","2019-03-02 13:12:38","18","35","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/awhmyq/fear_hopelessness_and_how_to_proceed/","True","UltimateZukey","1747897047.6860325","global temperature rise","manual"
"awn3qg","climate","scientific","Hi guys, I wrote an essay on how climate changes effects polar bears, would love to hear your thoughts.","Climate change and the effects it has on polar bears

NASA’s resource page defines climate change as a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to Earth’s atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, but also encompass changes such as sea level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme weather events. With the rising temperatures, the climates of different ecosystems will change as well as becoming warmer until the point they are no longer habitable for the organisms living in them. One species that climate change visibly affects are the polar bears in the Arctic. Polar Bears are the largest bear species in the world growing up to 9 feet and 1,300 pounds. Their habitat consists of arctic regions including Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway. The Arctic areas the bears occupy are made up of pack ice where currents and wind interact, forming a continually melting and refreezing ice patch. These ice packs are where polar bears will spend most of their life. The bears will hunt, mate, and raise their young on these ice packs. Because of the nature of climate change, these ice patches are melting at an increasing rate, leading to less habitat and hunting ground for the bears. NASA claims that the rapid decline in the Arctic sheets is soon going to be much to offset in the future, stating that within 20 or 30 years the ice lost will not be able to be replaced. In this paper, I will cover the changes brought by global warming focusing on the shrinking habitat of the polar bears and the effects this has on the world around them. 

The Arctic ice packs covers the poles of the world. As of 2018, NASA approximates, the rate of change on the polar ice packs has been at a decrease of 12.8 percent since the last decade. The ice packs and polar bears are linked if the ice disappears so do the polar bears. The ice is home to polar bears for most of the year, with exception to the warm months when they go inland. The ice packs are where the bears will, hunt, raise their young, and find mates. They depend on the ice to live. Besides habitat, the ice is a resource of food for the bears. Their number one food source is ringed seals due to the high amount of fat they provide. Ring seals and polar bears share much of the same habitat. The seals rely on the ice to offer areas of rest and safety. In turn, this gives the polar bears a chance to catch food. Polar bears spend 50 percent of their life hunting, however, their chances of catching a seal are very low, about 2 in every ten according to WWF. As the ice shrinks the chances of catching any prey shrink with it. With the loss of solid ice, there is a more open ocean between the bears and the seals. The bears depend on the ice to hunt, waiting at air holes used by seals for a chance to grab the seals as they come up for a breath. As the ice packs melt the need for the seals to use air holes lowers. With fewer air holes the seals have more open ocean giving an edge in the favor of the seal. The ice holes used by seals are the only feasible way for a bear to catch prey. This has lead to some bears dying due to starvation and exhaustion. Polar bears along with most species of bear prefer not to engage in fights, the land available to them is constantly shrinking putting them in closer contact with other bears. This is dangerous for a mother bear and her cubs. It is common for male bears to kill other cubs, with the other male's cubs dead it offers the other male a chance to spread his genes instead. According to Michael Greshko a biologist writing for national geographic, In the past the killing of cubs was not as common due to the large territory bears normally live in, but it is becoming more common with the ice melt and lack of prey. The killing of cubs normally won't lead to a large change in the population but with the already scarce resources to the bears, the killing of offspring could be taking away from the probability of polar bear populations recovering. According to Polar Bear International changes in sea ice, permafrost, and prey species in the Arctic are linked to reduced body condition and smaller litter size in polar bears meaning the importance of protecting the polar bear population is paramount. 

Humans and polar bears have lived side by side for thousands of years. The native people saw them as spiritual animals, often time making shrines to the bears using their skins, and would leave gifts for their spirits. The indigenous people would hunt the polar bears making sure everything was used except the liver. They also believed that if the bear was treated with respect it would tell the other bears about the hunter who treated it well, ensuring successful hunts in the future. This air of respect for the polar bear was held by the indigenous tribes of the Arctic. This respect continued to be a way of thinking through the years by the people and towns that have regular interaction with polar bears. Most of the time polar bears and human interaction is limited, due to the polar bear lifestyles they don't spend much time near people and towns. With climate change removing the ice sheets its causing polar bears to push towards dry land and into the human populations. Due to lack of prey, in the summer seasons when the bears push towards land, they are hungry and more opportunistic hunters sometimes going after dogs or humans as prey. 

In the time from 1960-1970 there were a recorded 7 attacks on humans by polar bears, from 2000-2010 there were only six. In the time from 2010-2014, there have already been 15 attacks on humans according to a study done by Wilder et al. The frequency of attacks from the last decade provide evidence that polar bears are becoming more aggressive towards humans. The data collected by Wilder et al took into consideration and classified the bear attacks into predatory and nonpredatory. This is done by gathering information on the attack, such as where the bear was biting as a bear looking for prey will attack the head and neck, while one fighting for protection will attack other areas. The attacks on humans spawn revenge parties. Local people will take up arms and hunt down the bear they believe responsible for the attack and kill it. There are some groups who have recognized this change in conflict with the bears and have made strides to cut down on the conflict between the bears and humans. Polar Bears International is working to reduce conflict by educating people who live in polar bear areas. They are spreading information on the best ways to avoid conflict, including using bear spray and other deterrents, putting on training workshops, and researching technology that could alert to the approach of bears allowing people to deter the bear. Many towns that are exposed to polar bears have come up with unique ways to control the interactions they have with polar bears. One of those towns is Arviat, Manitoba. Polar bears were attacking the towns dog team yards, where sled dogs were housed and fed. To reduce bear attacks, local mushers now move their dogs into one large area closer to town, surrounded by electric fencing. Another town in Manitoba, their conservation efforts were to build a holding facility to house problem bears that came too close to town during the fall migration and release them at a later time. Humans are the main instigator of climate change, we must find ways to deal with what we've created.

Polar bears are considered a keystone species in their ecosystem. A keystone species is a species of animal that many other animals in the ecosystem rely on to keep the ecosystem healthy and thriving. Predators such as the polar bear are important in the ecosystem for many reasons. They cull the vulnerable prey such as the old and injured. This allows other members of the prey species to have more food opportunities along with better mating chances. According to Caroline Fraser from Yale Environment, predators also help to control the population size of prey species. Without predators food will become scarce for the prey species, disease will spread at a higher rate, causing the population to drop to an unhealthy level. Polar bears are also scavengers when a dead whale washes onto the shore polar bears will take the opportunity to eat it. This may help stop the meat from rotting and spreading disease and parasites and also allows other scavengers an opportunity to feed as well. Polar bears play a large part in native culture. Not only is it important to protect polar bears, we must also protect their prey. To keep a healthy ecosystem there needs to be a balance between predators and prey. With the effect, climate change is having on arctic environments both predator and prey are at risk. To combat this risk there need to be protections set up against anything that could cause harm. Organizations like WWF are looking into ways to limit the possible harm put on these species. They are protesting oil drilling in the sensitive ecosystems of polar bears, teaching people what can be done to protect the ecosystem. To keep order in the ecosystem the polar bear needs to be protected and climate change needs to be stopped. 

Climate change is caused by many aspects of human behavior. Whether we are putting greenhouse gasses into the air, overfishing, cutting down forests, or performing non-sustainable farming techniques humans are destroying the world. Because of climate change, the biodiversity in the world is in danger. Rising temperature is causing early migration, spread of disease, coral bleaching, and shrinking of the ice caps. It is not too late to change the way we live and protect the world for the coming generations. Many organizations, governments, and everyday people are trying to make a change. WWF is an organization whose goal is to protect nature and reduce the threats of climate change. They achieve this goal through education. Teaching people in areas with threatened diversity and ecosystems how to live side by side and how to protect the land around them. Polar bear international is a conservation agency that works on the protection and conservation of polar bears. Their goal as stated on their website “Our mission is to conserve polar bears and the sea ice they depend on. Through media, science, and advocacy, we work to inspire people to care about the Arctic, the threats to its future, and the connection between this remote region and our global climate.” this shows there are people who want to see change. Change doesn't happen overnight it takes time, but working together and supporting organizations that strive to conserve and restore it is possible to stop climate change before it's too late.
