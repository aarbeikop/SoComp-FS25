[Tool-wielding monkeys push local shellfish to edge of extinction](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531441-900-toolwielding-monkeys-push-local-shellfish-to-edge-of-extinction/) - any tool-wielding species can and probably will destroy the environment given sufficient technology and population level. 

BTW it's a myth that primitive humans lived as stewards of nature, there is a book on this that dispels that notion (forget name but recently published). Here's a [paper](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~alcoze/for398/class/pristinemyth.html) for example about the Americas: 

> Abstract. The myth persists that in 1492 the Americas were a sparsely populated wilderness, -a world of barely perceptible human disturbance.- There is substantial evidence, however, that the Native American landscape of the early sixteenth century was a humanized landscape almost everywhere. Populations were large. Forest composition had been modified, grasslands had been created, wildlife disrupted, and erosion was severe in places. Earthworks, roads, fields, and settlements were ubiquitous. With Indian depopulation in the wake of Old World disease, the environment recovered in many areas. A good argument can be made that the human presence was less visible in 1750 than it was in 1492.","2017-12-05 16:28:32","33","FF00A7","1747883428.111873","global temperature rise","manual"

"dqt38bp","t3_7hq1dr","7hq1dr","collapse","skeptical","FF00A7 might be referring to *The Ecological Indian* by Shepherd Krech. The book documents the innumerable ways in which Native Americans/Indians trashed their environment simply because it seemed limitless to them. (Sound familiar?) 

Human colonizers invariably used fire as a tool for hunting large mammals. Along with wiping them out, early humans' use of fire caused enormous cascading ecological damage. The arrival in Australia of the first humans is linked to an ecological collapse that changed the continental climate humid to arid over the course of a few centuries. Recent evidence (see, for example, Gill, Jacqueline. *New Phytologist* (2014) 201:1163-1169. Ecological impacts of the late Quaternary megaherbivore extinctions.) suggests that similar ecosystem collapses played out everywhere as human population spread around the world.

It's worth noting that fire was first ""tamed"" by *Homo erectus*. Our species stands on the shoulders of ancestors who had already found the means for radically and permanently altering their environment. Prior to the advent of fire, caves in southern Africa reveal intact bones of large cats, intermixed with fragmented bones of other species, including hominins. Once fire enters the picture we find intact *H. erectus* bones mixed with fragments of other species, including the big cats. With the taming of fire, the eaten became the eaters.

https://www.lenntech.com/greenhouse-effect/global-warming-history.htm

Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. He proposed a relation between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and temperature. He found that the average surface temperature of the earth is about 15 C because of the infrared absorption capacity of water vapor and carbon dioxide. This is called the natural greenhouse effect. Arrhenius suggested a doubling of the CO2 concentration would lead to a 5 C temperature rise. He and Thomas Chamberlin calculated that human activities could warm the earth by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This research was a by-product of research of whether carbon dioxide would explain the causes of the great Ice Ages. This was not actually verified until 1987.

After the discoveries of Arrhenius and Chamberlin the topic was forgotten for a very long time. At that time it was thought than human influences were insignificant compared to natural forces, such as solar activity and ocean circulation. It was also believed that the oceans were such great carbon sinks that they would automatically cancel out our pollution. Water vapor was seen as a much more influential greenhouse gas.","2017-12-05 17:35:38","6","eleitl","1747883428.1275175","global temperature rise","manual"

"dqttk7q","t3_7hq1dr","7hq1dr","collapse","skeptical","I think of humans as nothing more than ribosomes executing a strand of DNA. In the case of humans, the strand of DNA corresponds to culture.

In much the same way as a real human body, it's possible and probably easy to change DNA in a single cell, but it's extremely difficult to change the same DNA in all cells in a consistent and safe manner.

Most DNA in an organism comes down from a bottle neck which is conception. Without this bottleneck, it's very hard to get a sync in the many cells. That analogy extends but let's leave it there and get to your question...


-------

In Anatolia, there is an ancient custom where when a child is born, a row of poplars is planted. The expectation is that by the time he becomes an adult, those poplars will be used to build him a house.

Australian bush was managed with controlled fires by aboriginals for thousands of years before white man arrived. These people inhabited Australia for 10's of thousands of years. There is significant evidence that they kept the ecosystem healthy... (unless of course you dogmatically understand the word healthy to mean undisturbed)

So despite contrary examples (which of course exist), there's nothing that says that humans *simply can't* be in sync with their environment and stewarts of it..

In that sense, I completely agree with him when he says:

>but human kind has the ability to be creative stewards of the earth, utilising what he calls ""humanistic"" technology

I don't think humans are inherently bad any more than I think ribosomes cause cancer. But ribosomes *are* the mechanism through which cancer develops.","2017-12-06 00:19:50","2","perspectiveiskey","1747883428.1275175","global temperature rise","manual"
