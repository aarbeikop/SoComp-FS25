we are 3-4 years away from triggering a Point of No Return (PNR).  Possibility exists that 2019/2020 is when El Nino comes back.


Just one of the 10 tipping points needs to reverse to put us in a hothouse Earth state.  Permafrost thaw, ocean methane hydrates, weakening carbon sinks, ocean bacterial respiration, amazon forest dieback, boreal forest dieback, reduction of artic ice (albedo), artic sea ice decline, antarctic sea ice decline, polar ice sheet loss

"9j7lw7","sustainability","action-oriented","Concerns on the reversal of the climate change curve","The core climate change argument is laid on the fact that earth’s average temperature is on a upward trend with increasing global emissions since industrial revolution. 

My concern is what if the trend continues to rise or worse there is a “ cooling” phase even with significant global emission reduction  effort.
If that happens in the future, then climate change denialists and skeptics will think this is a  propaganda and further efforts may cease and sustainability going to take a big hit. How will we convince people to go more green if that happens. 

Edit: My main point is what if the earth average temperature trend gets uncorrelated with the emission trend. It may be a temporary lag, but long enough for people to stop going green.
