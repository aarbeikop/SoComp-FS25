This is mostly a case of highlighting some soundbites and ignoring others. He also says in the same interview: ""Snow will probably cause chaos in 20 years time""

>Australia’s “permanent” drought

The actual thing being stated is that climate change predicts a substantially declining total precipitation and greater drought occurrence in Southern Australia. If you read up it's clear they talk about individual instances of drought in terms of natural variability, but the long term trend is towards greater drought. A few wetter years doesn't disprove this.

>2009 is expected to be one of the top-five warmest years on record

As far as I can see, it was.

>A new global temperature record will be set in 2009 or 2010

2010 was a new record.

>“looks like its going to be one of the most intense [solar] cycles since record-keeping began almost 400 years ago,”

How is that a climate prediction?

>There’s a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 we’ll have an ice-free (summer) Arctic

Very much an outlier prediction. The IPCC said around 2080 for Summer, 2040 (possibly as early as 2025) for September.

>“The entire north polar ice cap will be gone in 5 years”

See above, assuming accurate quoting.

>Arctic summers ice-free ‘by 2013’ 2007 Professor Wieslaw Maslowski

Pretty sure this is the same thing again, see above: outlier.

>The UK Met Office forecast up to 2014

Experimental decadal prediction. Short periods are highly sensitive to initial conditions so forecasting is inherently difficult, but attempts are being made in the hopes of making progress.

>the region will have an ice-free season in six years(2015).

Not clear what the prediction is here. Canadian sea ice or total Arctic sea ice? Another article carrying the quote talks about loss of multi-year sea ice by 2015, not necessarily the whole lot.

>$8-a-litre petrol in Australia by 2018

As noted, not climate related.

>In the 2020s, an intense heatwave equal to the longest on record from 1951 to 1999 is likely to occur as many as five times a decade in parts of the United States

Not sure on the specifics, but yes, there will be more heatwaves in future. Not sure what the problem is here?

>St Andrews golf course could crumble into the North Sea by 2050

As the word 'crumble' indicates, this is only partly climate related. The area is at risk from coastal erosion anyway.

>Tibetan glacial shrink to cut water supply by 2050

Again, don't know specifics but seems reasonable as a general point.

>Millions of Nigerians may have to flee rising sea levels by 2058 “In 50 years with a one-metre sea-level rise, two million, three million people would be homeless

Again, don't know specifics but clearly rising sea levels threaten people's homes. Those sea level rises are at the high end of current projections.","2016-01-06 14:08:46","5","skeeezoid","1747860909.0601487","global temperature rise","manual"

It just seems like an unscientific thing to do, especially when you are trying to predict something on a planetary scale, where there so many variables that may not have taken into consideration. It seems more scientific to say ""these are the trends, this is what is causing it, and this is what will happen down the line if nothing changes."" Because even if a specific prediction is slightly wrong or slightly off target, it only gives climate change denialism strength. So if by 2058, millions of Nigerians don't flee but only 1,999,999 Nigerians flee, then climate change deniers can say ""Ah ha! I told you climate change is a hoax.""

"czd32y9","t3_42sa4y","42sa4y","climate","scientific","I am a senior undergrad in the atmospheric and environmental science department of my university and have taken several climate science courses and atmospheric science-related courses.

I am currently taking a course titled Major Topics in Environmental Science: Climate Change this semester and we discussed this exact question today.   In short:  it doesn't correlate perfectly with atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and it never will.  There is a very significant statistical relationship, but it would be incorrect to say it correlates perfectly.

To sum it up, if you compare the [Keeling curve](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/co2_800k_zoom.png) of atmospheric CO2 concentrations to [global average temperatures](http://i.imgur.com/EiYypqA.jpg), you'll see they certainly do not match identically.  Also, you can see a rather stagnant period from ~1940 - ~1980 where global temperatures didn't even climb that much.  This is believed to be due to increased aerosol production and general air pollution (not to be confused with greenhouse gas emissions during that same period).  Aerosols and particulates decreases solar irradiance at the surface and therefore prevent temperatures from increasing.  So, as we worked to prevent aerosol and particulate pollution (which benefits our health), CO2 was again more closely correlated with global temperatures. 

Also, global temperatures are what we talk about when we talk about global warming.  You can't rely on one specific region to properly understand the dynamic global system.  There is more land in the northern hemisphere, and more ocean in the southern hemisphere.  Water has a much higher heat capacity than land, and therefore ""holds"" the heat caused by the local warming and therefore it doesn't show.  Also, in the northern Atlantic, temperatures have been decreasing greatly.  This is believed to be due to an alteration of the thermohaline circulation (basically temperature-and-salinity-driven ocean currents).  As glacial and sea ice melt into the ocean, the local salinity decreases and prevents the circulation from travelling it's typical path.


I hope that explains it well enough.  I could go on and on but I really don't have the time right now.  I'll check back and answer anything else if I get a chance.  I have access to a metric shit-ton of information on the subject and always enjoy spreading accurate information regarding human-induced climate change and recent global warming.","2016-01-26 22:09:58","6","KSCleves83","1747860979.0988271","global temperature rise","manual"
