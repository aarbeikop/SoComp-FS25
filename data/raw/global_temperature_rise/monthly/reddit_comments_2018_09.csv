It was pretty roundly debunked in 2012 by some of the more alarmist climate scientists, so that should be a clue. It amazes me that it keeps making the rounds.

However, I am not suggesting we just sod off trying to help the environment. Completely agree with this in that we need action and we need action now, just don’t post false facts (this I know not being you’re writing but just contributing). 

I agree that we need to adapt but it’s just a major thing- our population needs to decline but we can’t just kill people, we need to ration our food but obesity is still a major issue as well as malnutrition, we need to use our resources more efficiently but can we do this we renewables? There’s so much we need to do to survive as a species but is there really a way to prevent this? ","2018-09-10 00:00:50","3","lonewanderer25","1747891632.3815045","global temperature rise","manual"

It’s possible we could stop the Gulf Stream, which would cause big changes in which bits of earth are warm (or not), but that’s not the same as an ice age. 

It is far more likely that we accidentally turn Earth into Venus unless we hit the brakes really hard, and quickly. ","2018-09-27 00:44:28","5","ital-is-vital","1747892230.3711877","global temperature rise","manual"
"e6pq9cw","t3_9j7lw7","9j7lw7","sustainability","action-oriented","I think, from a political perspective, ""convincing people to go green"" isn't a viable option. The project climate believers should endeavor open is to (a) create policies that maximize conservation efforts and (b) ensure continued political power. Climate e policy solutions that have used tacit behavior changes or depended upon market dynamics have fallen woefully short of meeting environmental targets. EU Cap and Trade runs into a credit surplus problem, B.C. carbon taxes haven't be *high* enough to meet emission reduction goals (similar issues would occur w/US legislation)

At some level, direct state intervention, aggressive regulatory regimes, and onerous carbon taxes will need to be implemented to ensure we keep warming to, at maximum, 3 degrees. From a political dimension, the opposition to these measures are, from an operational standpoint, meaningless. Politics is a contest for power.  The goal of which, from our perspective, is to continue exerting political power to ensure climate policy is enacted and implemented.

For the last 500 years corporations have been designed to Maximize profit no matter what the consequence.   Every social structure we have, school, church, little Tim’s birthday party is about profit. ( consumerism bday gifts).

For the last 200 years maximin profit came from maximizing energy exploitation- who cares if the oceans boil - shareholders need the dividend.

For all our lives everything we have seen and done was designed to maximize shareholder value.  Even Dad taking you fishing in the SUV and Mom packing you a Jiff and Welches sandwich for school (training) lunch.

We will not convince people of anything inside the existing system.

Our technology isn't getting cleaner because we want it to be cleaner. It's simply getting replaced by more cost effective sources that just happen to be cleaner as well.  
It's frustrating, I wish it was different, but we're changing according to our innovation and neither the deniers nor the actual science is going to have a significant impact on our behaviour. Again, I wish it was different, I wish went above and beyond. But we're set in our ways and we're moving towards the better. The real leeway will be in the coming decades and if the whole ecosystem happens to coincide with some kind of cooling we're in a much better place.
