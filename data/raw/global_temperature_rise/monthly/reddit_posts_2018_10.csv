**I don’t make a lot of political posts but with the mid-terms approaching I wanted to share some thoughts that hopefully may resonate with some of you. I have friends on both sides of the aisle and often find my own political position spread between liberal, conservative and moderate depending on the issue. However some recent news from the “Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change” has suddenly changed me to a one-issue voter. In a nutshell, it basically estimates we have only 12 years to enact drastic global action to reduce green house gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration. If we fail, atmospheric temperatures will rise by more than 2 degrees C which may not seem like much but would have devastating impact on forests, wildlife, coral reefs, ocean water levels and displace millions of people around the world. This ain’t a drill, people. It also sets off chain reactions which make reversing climate change after this point exponentially more difficult. In light of this, I implore everyone to vote in politicians, regardless of party, who fully support the global initiative to prevent this. Fortunately, there are a lot of benefits to achieving the goal including energy independence,** **increased GDP, more jobs, cleaner water/air etc. Since our country is the second highest emitter of greenhouse gases and also currently the least cooperative with global initiatives, you have an extremely leveraged position at this place and time in human history. Please vote accordingly.** ""","2018-10-27 16:50:05","3","0","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/9rvpz6/proofread_my_facebook_post_to_get_my/","True","BrotherBringTheSun","1747892656.632543","global temperature rise","manual"
"9ldcqj","worldnews","mixed","We’re Anthony Kuhn and Frank Langfitt, veteran China correspondents for NPR. Ask us anything about China’s rise on the global stage.","From dominating geopolitics in Asia to buying up ports in Europe to investing across Africa, the U.S. and beyond, the Chinese government projects its power in ways few Americans understand. In a new series, NPR explores what an emboldened China means for the world. (https://www.npr.org/series/650482198/chinas-global-influence)

The two correspondents have done in-depth reporting in China on and off for about two decades. Anthony Kuhn has been based in Beijing and is about to relocate to Seoul, while Frank Langfitt spent five years in Shanghai before becoming NPR’s London correspondent.

We will answer questions starting at 1 p.m. ET. Ask us anything.

"9ng8be","collapse","skeptical","Notice the IPCC charts show steady temperature rises? Well.......","In chaotic systems - there's instant jumps to different (higher) levels of energy.

Phase transitions is the tech term.

Notice there are none in the charts...

Now realise that somewhere or even in several places in those charts, there's going to be sudden jumps in temperature.

How close are we to the first one? How big will it be?

It's suspicious as hell that this is seldom mentioned to the general public - it might get people doing something, if they realise a sudden big change could happen any time while the temperature is gradually rising.     
It's a BIG reason why ""1.5 degrees"" isn't a safe warming.      
**We could simply jump right past it in a year or two.**  (Did you know that? I bet not)

"9kgefn","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2018 q3","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for almost 3 years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.
