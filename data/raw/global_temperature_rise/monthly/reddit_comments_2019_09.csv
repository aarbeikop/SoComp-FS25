Logical fallacy of argumentum ad hominem. ""You are wrong because of who you are"".

Every major science academy on Earth supports the IPCC's conclusions. The over whelming majority of IPCC authors are scientists.

A conspiracy theory. If the fundamentals of the science were false it would be simple to show, this is the same excuse creationists use about evolution.

In the UKJ your position in a university is payed for from the main university funds, the payscale is set so all academics of a similar role recieve the same funding. This again is a conspiracy theory.

All I can really say is that as others have pointed out, the disagreement with someone's science simply because of their position is...illogical. Good science is good science, regardless of the researchers label (ironically this is a point parroted by many folks who redistribute work from folks like Judith Curry and Alan Watts...even though those are prime examples a good scientist who left academia and someone who isn't exactly a working scientist). 

Beyond that...I think both sides of these debates need to consistently undergo bias checks. I do think (and this is entirely personal opinion) that one side seems more willing to do bias checks than the other. I also think there is a tendency to get ""into the weeds"" in some debates, and again as someone who is in the field I find this part the most frustrating; we spend years on a particular project, thinking deeply, questioning assumptions, running and re-running analyses to make sure we didn't miss something. Yet someone who spent an hour searching through the internet (likely through blog posts and opinion pieces that touch on science rather than primary literature) is an expert on radiative forcing. 

I get that science is a bit ivory tower sometimes. I hear and agree with all of the concerns that publishing is a rough, sometimes unethical landscape. But sadly I think whoever was pulling some strings with some early denier seeding has been successful in convincing a large swath of the public that essentially published academic science = bad and guerilla science = good. Maybe it's the quintessentially American concept of rebellious independence. Maybe it's money. Who knows. 

All we do know is: that the climate has always been changing...that's a given; causes of changes range from orbital eccentricities to geologic events; we will never know the true contribution (quantitatively) of humans to climate change, as it is much to complex to parse out single attributes; but/and we are undoubtedly having at least some effect based on a fundamental physical property of greenhouse gases...the very gases that give us a pleasant atmosphere...that's just basic physics. 

I would hope everyone could agree on those things. If not...well...some bias somewhere got into an internet echo chamber and off if went. 

This really is a difficult time to be in the field. Were damned if we do and damned if we don't (partake in the conversation). So we bury ourselves in our work and hope it speaks for itself. But then it doesn't in this era of science demonization. Or...sometimes worse...it gets misused by alarmists who take results out of context. Both sides are often wrong. And I sometimes wish we could go back to a time when science was science, and not some rallying cry for internet wars.

The threshold facts of climate change aren't affected by bias. As long as you start with proven facts, bias is a trivial issue. 

>IPCC are not scientists, they are politicians with a left and green agenda

It's best to describe IPCC as a bureaucratic process, and its reports have all the issues that committee-driven reports usually have. Although the IPCC is tasked with answering a question chosen by political appointees, so political influence isn't absent in the process. But again, the facts of climate change aren't subject to political influence. 

>Scientist working against AGW are silenced and their funds are cut.

This is just incoherent. This person has no idea about the astounding variety of ways in which research is supported. It's fair to say that research funds are probably scarce in climate science as a whole, compared to the vast resources needed to collect global datasets and produce global analyses. But in the free world, no single source or idea has a monopoly on how scientific research is supported. 

>These AGW-Scientists are biased because of their fund sources expecting certain outcomes. Unlike for example the Heartland Institute (or the German EIKE) that are telling the truth.

Again, facts are not subject to bias. These bias arguments are just trying to avoid confronting the facts.

>Your whole AGW-bubble just burst, as Dr. Mann lost in court. His hockey stick is now officially a fraud and he refuses to make his raw data and methods public.“

Court processes don't influence the reliability of facts either. Again this is an attempt to divert attention from the facts. 

>There is still no proof for AGW. They just fail to deliver one, probably because AGW is a hoax.

This is a much different, and stronger, argument to counter. Strong proof of AGW is going to take generations to assemble. Any skeptic who asserts that current evidence fails to reach a given standard of proof is standing on pretty solid ground.

Right now, the best evidence we have are correlations between human activity and climate change. The strength of these correlations has been mixed in the past, although it's possible to construct an argument that they're getting stronger now as more data is collected. That's probably about as far as I would go in countering a pretty-strong argument that ""proof"" of AGW is still an issue for the future, not really a present-day issue.    

>All this climate hysteria is just to come up with new taxes to rip the small citizens off their money.

It's definitely true that some politicians see climate change as an opportunity to shift financial and tax burdens in their societies, and ""hysteria"" probably is a tool in their arsenal. 

But time after time, these arguments amount to nothing more than attempts to evade pretty-simple facts which support a hypothesis that the climate is changing, in ways that are correlated with certain human activities. The facts are what matter. And they're easily accessible to everybody.  

People who deny facts are not engaging in reasoned debate, so reasoning with them probably is fruitless.","2019-09-06 15:37:52","1","DocHarford","1747906787.5467122","global temperature rise","manual"

What is relevant is if the science is right or not. If the science is wrong, then demonstrate that.

If instead of demonstrating how the science is wrong, someone question the characters of the scientists or the trustworthiness of the IPCC, then that can be seen as an implicit admission that the science is fundamentally correct and cannot be successfully refuted. Why else try to shift the discussion away from the actual science?

One possible response to these statements is to ask if this means that the other party thinks the science is wrong and if so in what way and how he/she can demonstrate that?

Whether you agree with Ridd or not, he was fired for speaking out against bad policy and bad science.

The link you provide concerning the Mann v Ball case is typical of the slanted shit that the AGW community comes up with. Ball won that case fairly. He asked early on for it to be dismissed for several reasons but Mann would not allow that. He'd rather torture an octogenarian. Well, Mann got what was coming to him - a big loss plus exposure for not releasing his data to the court.  

In the ""climate-gate"" emails one fellow even asked for a copy of ""Mike's Nature trick"". He meant by that the fraudulent stats that Mann got past the reviewers.

There are many theories, but I think the best one is this: The earth always had periods of heat and cold due to the distance between sun and earth. 
This makes our seasons and maybe this has lead to the fact that once Europe was covered by ice.

However even if this isn't the case, there is one thing for sure: CO2 isn't the Initiator, but the catalysator. 
We would have to take away large potions of the CO2 at once, which is only possible if we lower the emissions and plant so many trees that CO2 becomes O2 and C again. 

By only lowering the CO2 emissions nothing will change. Even more: If we would stop ALL CO2 emissions worldwide at once (which is impossible), the already existing CO2 would continue the climate change.

What people need to realize:

1. It's not 11:30, 11:55 or 12. It's already 6 in the afternoon. We are far beyond our limits. 

2. Climate Change isn't the only problem in this world. What about the pollution of the world by plastic in the ocean or oil? These problems needs to be adressed too ASAP.

I remember as a child we had the Big E, commercials on ""Water, don't waste a drop"", captain planet, discovery channel documentaries.

I sometimes like to go on the NOAA site on occasion to look at interesting statistics and trends for fun sometimes.

This September has been _exceptionally_ wet for the US.  Particularly in the Midwest, where I'm at, it's causing quite a few problems for farmers who would have, in the past, normally have liked to be harvesting around now.  These farmers got into the fields late this year on account of excessive flooding and wet fields that were not ready for planting.  A lot of fields had standing water in them.  Now that it is harvest season, farmers are running into the same problem they did last year.  Last September we in our area, had 4 times our normal precipitation rate.  This year, throughout the US in September while the monthly totals aren't in yet, the largest daily accumulations of rainfalls for September are insane again.  

https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/records

My question is: I know weather doesn't directly represent climate, are the wetter springs and falls going to be more normal in the future in the midwest (along with drier in the west)?  What sorts of weather changes are predicted in the US expect in the next 15-20 years if current trends continue?  In the next 50 years, and in the next 100 years?

Also, I read somewhere that emissions are likely to offset the next iceage, which would have come in around 1500 years, could you talk some about that?","2019-09-20 14:39:12","7","Let_you_down","1747907115.9501288","global temperature rise","manual"

I think my question is best suited to Dr. Dukes or Dr. Cloyd, what are your thoughts on the 'micro vs macro' drivers of climate change? 

Specifically, in my understanding, if a relatively small area, such as that surrounding a human settlement or industry, has substantial change in vegetation/albedo/local emissions this area is far more likely to experience effects which are likely to be ascribed to 'climate change'. This is accurate in that the climate has changed but innaccurate in that the reduction of global atmospheric carbon is not going to help the degraded local environment and as such is not likely to reduce the immediate impacts of climate change that these areas are experiencing.

Are you aware of any studies quantifying the 'micro' effect at a local level and how it contributes to the 'macro' or global effect?","2019-09-20 13:37:40","5","Dragoarms","1747907115.9638648","global temperature rise","manual"
"f0vo2ht","t3_d6uez5","d6uez5","science","scientific","An article caught my attention yesterday because Cory Booker advocated for nuclear power in addition to expanding renewables. The article contained some interesting information regarding how significant nuclear power is in aiding our transition away from fossil fuels that I had never seen before. Here is a summary:

-	in order for renewables to replace coal and natural gas plants by 2050 renewables must grow an average of 2% per year (currently they average 0.6%, according to the article)
-	if we simultaneously increase the number of electric vehicles on the roads to replace ICE vehicles we would need to double total capacity which would require a growth in renewable energy more than 7 times the current rate (presumably the article means replacing all ICEs, but it does not specify)
-	if we phase out nuclear plants by 2035 this increases the required growth rate of renewables to 17x current rates
-	if we decommissioned nuclear plants immediately the growth rate for renewables becomes 25x current rates

I didn’t see any source for these specific statistics. Does this information seem accurate? Where do you see nuclear power fitting in while we transition away from coal and natural gas? 

Based on the article we are nowhere close to the required growth rate for renewable energy to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050, how do we start to close that gap and make up for the deficit? What do you think is the primary reason we have not achieved the rate required?
