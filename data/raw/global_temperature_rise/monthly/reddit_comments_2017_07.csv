Everything man made will eventually be subducted, melted back down into magma, sorted by density, mineral composition, atomic structure, etc. We will no longer exist 

Thats not how this works. The continents are like islands floating above the tectonic convection streams and apart from the edges (which usually are the deepest parts of the oceans) their surface is very little affected by this. Sedimentation is a much faster process than tectonics in burying the old. But even this process doesnt pose a threat to any species because it is still extremely slow. The fossils and fossil fuels we dig up from a mile deep are many hundreds of millions of years old.

Species dont go extinct from such extremely slow changes. Species mostly go extinct because theyre pushed aside by others and lose their territory and resources. 

> The main point I'm trying to make is we cannot stop it. This is earth's cycle. It was here before us and it will be here long after we all die. We are a bigger threat to ourselves and the species that live among us than we are to the Earth.

Im not sure if I understand your point at all or if it makes sense to begin with. Id say we are a bigger threat to other humans and other species and other humans and species are a bigger threat to us than anything else. Why should we be ""a threat to ourselves"" and what does that even mean?

>  Humans have sympathy for innocence and in many eyes, the Earth is an innocent provider and we are taking advantage of it because we are devilish greedy bastards.

We want others to be innocent and we accuse others of being greedy bastards, not ourselves. Environmentalists are on average well earning upper middle class people who want the plebs and the third world to be less greedy because they sense the threat they pose to their affluence.

Let's take H2O being fixed.  This isn't true.  Look at photosynthesis - part making sugars in plants is breaking up H2O.  Part of the metabolism of those sugars in animals results in water again.  Water can be broken up, it can be put back together.  Carbon-14 (what we use to age things thousands of years old) is created in the atmosphere by bumping a proton from nitrogen and replacing it with a neutron.  The rate of reaction is relatively stable, but certainly isn't fixed (and was greatly increased during above-ground atomic bomb tests).  Helium and hydrogen gases, once released from rock, can escape the atmosphere and escape into space.

So, on some level, yes carbon will eventually come back to equilibrium, it will take hundreds of thousands of years.  This is a vastly different scale than plate tectonics.  Overall, it's a nihilistic view of man's role and our ability to change what we're doing.  I suggest you read more on the subject, particularly the IPCC summary for policymakers.

"djy1xnb","t3_6lzfxv","6lzfxv","climatechange","action-oriented","There are LOTS of things wrong with your rant.  I get your main point, but damn, you need to brush up on the specifics.  Pollution does not cause the ozone layer, for instance.  But, regardless of the technical problems here, your point seems to be that we should tell people that earth is the victim, here.

Honestly, you're wrong.  The earth doesn't care.  It's a rock.  There is a very thin bit on the surface of the rock where life exists, and it's that life that cares.  Humans live and die in human timescales, where global warming, climate change, or whatever you want to call it is progressing along generational timescales.  The subduction of all things happens on geological time scales (tens of thousands of years).

What happens is that when some land is submerged under other land, the life living on the land *moves* to whatever is on top.  If the seas rise up, people will move away from the encroaching water.  Yes, there will be hurricanes or tidal waves or whatever that will destroy the homes and property of humans currently living on whatever coast there is, but people won't stay where they are to be drowned.

There have been anatomically modern humans on the planet for hundreds of thousands of years, and close to modern humans for millions of years.  Our current holocene is less than 14,000 years old.  Before that, Ice covered much of the northern hemisphere land masses, and seas were a couple of hundred feet lower.  For those trying to do the math at home, that means the average sea level rise since the end of the last glaciation has been about 5mm per year.  Scientists will tell you that the post-glaciation sea level rise dropped off to less than 1mm per year a few thousand years ago.  So, during a lot of our recent history, SLR was more than twice what it is today. Humans have historically lived at the coast.  We know of several 5000 year old cities that are over 200 feet underwater today.  

So, sea level rise does make us move - but somehow has failed to destroy civilization itself, cause the extinction of humanity, or even really remained our big, scary natural disaster story.  You know all of those folk tales told about the sea swallowing up all of the cities?  Yeah, me neither.  Because it's a slow, easily avoidable threat.  We just watch the young men and women build houses farther uphill than our fathers did.

There are alarmists who are telling you that the ""ice caps are melting"" and the coasts are going to flood, killing everyone.  Or, at least, that's what you're getting.  The entire Arctic ice cap can melt away completely and it won't raise the sea level by one millimeter.  This is because the northern ice cap is floating ice.  

The southern ice cap has a few small portions that are melting.  Oddly enough, it's mostly volcanic action that's melting those, but there's help from warmer water in the Southern Ocean.  The majority of the ice cap, though, is growing.  Yes, there is more ice on Antarctica now than there was when this whole Climate Change scare began.  It's an observed fact.  

We were told 20 years ago that streets in Manhattan would be 10 feet underwater by now, that Miami would be completely submerged, that there would be 50 million climate refugees by the year 2010, that the midwest would be a dust bowl again, with black sand blowing across the barren plains strongly enough to strip all of the paint off of all of the buildings.  None of this has come true.

I own a house (well, the bank and I, mostly the bank) on the coast.  If current estimates of sea level rise are not gross exaggerations, I might live to see 4"" of sea level rise before I die.  The bottom of my dock is 1' above high tide, and my house is 6' higher than that.  Should I begin to panic?  Make plans to be able to jump in the car to escape the rising seas?

I'm all for moving to renewable energy, using electric cars (I own one), powering my home with solar panels, reducing our pollution levels, etc.  I plant trees, have an oyster garden to help filter the bay, and recycle.  But, I avoid listening to alarmists who tell lies, and read science papers for the unvarnished truth, knowing that even scientists are not immune to confirmation bias.","2017-07-08 13:36:46","4","deck_hand","1747878264.020751","global temperature rise","manual"
