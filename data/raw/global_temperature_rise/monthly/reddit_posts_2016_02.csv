Ok so what I think I know is that the Arctic is losing sea ice because of rising global temperatures and Greenland is losing land ice. and then the antarctic is losing land ice which is causing more antarctic sea ice because the land ice is fresh water which freezes at a higher temperature than the salt ocean water. Did I get all of that right? If I'm right about why the antarctic is gaining sea ice then why isn't the same true for the arctic? Is the Greenland land ice not fresh water then?
