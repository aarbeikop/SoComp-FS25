Should also be prepared for the temp rise to ""pause"" as part of a base forming pattern. Historically the temps have been going up in a step fashion, short term bursts to a new regime followed by plateaus. We are currently leaving an old plateau and entering a new regime.

A question that can be answered now is how long the plateaus last before the next spike upward. If the plateau period is shortening.","2016-07-20 14:44:16","5","FF00A7","1747867138.3585155","global temperature rise","manual"

Having the agency that does the ""official"" reporting maintain the ""official data set"" is very much like having car makers test emissions. And we all know how that turned out.

ENSO cycles include a peak and a trough. The 2015 ENSO cycle is not yet complete. If we switch the data set to one more widely used [we see flat temperatures](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2001/to:2015/mean:12/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2001/to:2015/mean:12/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2001/to:2014/mean:12/trend). El Nino did not take hold until about 1/2 way through 2015. If we remove 2015 entirely (the blue line) we see a drop over the period you selected, though that drop is merely an artifact of the selected period.
