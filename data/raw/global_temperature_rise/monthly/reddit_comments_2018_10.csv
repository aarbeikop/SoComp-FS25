[People have been doing this since the 1800s, when people referred to CO2 as 'carbonic acid gas'](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6xhFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA382#v=onepage&q&f=false)

Add to the fact that [CO2 concentrations really are rising](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/mlo_full_record.png), and it [comes from burning fossil fuels](https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-increase-is-natural-not-human-caused.htm).

You can also talk about how [changes in CO2 concentration were a big part of how the world warmed at the end of the last ice age](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/CarbonCycle/page4.php)

Talk about how [almost all the scientists who study the issue are convinced that the warming is due to greenhouse gasses people have emitted](https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm).

If you want fully-footnoted details, it's [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf#page=39).

Consider talking about how [the fossil fuels industry hired the tobacco-cancer denial machine to instill doubt in peoples' minds](https://smile.amazon.com/Merchants-Doubt-Handful-Scientists-Obscured/dp/1608193942/), and that they make it hard to find accurate and truthful information.

https://www.npr.org/2018/06/20/616083178/born-independent-taiwan-s-defiant-new-generation-is-coming-of-age

I see you guys didn't write this piece, but it's extremely misleading and factually incorrect in several places. KMT veterans and their descendants only make up 10% of Taiwan's population, but this article implies their experiences are the most common and mainstream in Taiwan. Completely neglects the experience of the 90% of the population that are Hoklo, Hakka, aboriginal (!!!), or new immigrants (mostly from SE Asia).    

The article notes that a Shanghai based Chinese correspondent contributed to the article. Information about Taiwan is highly censored in the PRC, and most PRC Chinese are raised from birth on anti Taiwan propaganda that is misleading at best and malicious at worst.     **Why don't you have a Taiwan based correspondent?**

By comparison, imagine if you asked an Israeli correspondent to describe the feelings and opinions of Palestinians, or asked only white citizens of South Africa about politics and presented their opinions as representative of all South Africans.   

I really respect NPR research on domestic issues but for this kind of sensitive international issue, you really need to do better.
