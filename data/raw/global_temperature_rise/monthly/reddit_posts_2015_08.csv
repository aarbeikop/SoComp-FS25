Karl et al 2015 uses SST data to adjust ARGO data and determines the heat is in the ocean. Though the recent trans indo-pacific paper entails there is no heat below 700m, and likely lies within 100-300m of the ocean's surface.   

The [USCRN and USCHN](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=cmbushcn&parameter=anom-tavg&time_scale=p12&begyear=2005&endyear=2015&month=12) which are significant due to their stations being designed to observe the climate, not the weather (Having been placed in locations where development is not expected for 50-100 years, thus requiring minimal adjustment for UHI and other affects) ranging from Russia, Alaska, Canada, to various locations in the US, Mexico and Hawaii. About 6% of the landmass on earth, but none the less one of the best built to purpose networks we have...shows no significant warming.     

--------  

Now obviously the ocean + land = surface, ergo heat on the ocean = heat on the surface.   
Heat in the ocean however should have a secondary affect, one that we have been warned about quite a few times actually.   

Sea level rise.    

Heat in water causes expansion which of course affects SLR. So logically the heat (not in the atmosphere, likely not on the land, but in the ocean) should be causing expansion and thus increase SLR exponentially as heat continues to rise exponentially.

And here's the problem, it hasn't.

>What was learned
Over the nine years of their study, the three researchers report that the mean GIA-adjusted mass gain and mass loss in the 19 areas of their primary focus amounted to -(0.7 ± 0.4 mm/year) of sea-level fall and +(1.8 ± 0.6) mm/year of sea-level rise, for a net effect of +(1.1 ± 0.6) mm/year. Then, to obtain a figure for total sea-level change, they added the steric component of +(0.5 ± 0.5) mm/year, which was derived by Leuliette and Willis (2011), to their net result to obtain a final (geocenter neglected) result of +(1.6 ± 0.8) mm/year and **a final (geocenter corrected) result of +(1.7 ± 0.8) mm/year.**

>What it means
The final geocenter-corrected result of Baur et al. is most heartening, as Chambers et al. (2012) indicate that ""sea level has been rising on average by 1.7 mm/year over the last 110 years,"" as is also suggested by the analyses of Church and White (2006) and Holgate (2007). **Concomitantly, the air's CO2 concentration has risen by close to a third. And, still, it has not impacted the rate-of-rise of global sea level!**   

Corroborated by NOAA's ""The Budget of Recent Global Sea Level Rise 2005–2012""   

>The sum of steric sea level rise and the ocean mass component has a trend of 1.1 ± 0.8 mm/a over the period when the Paulson GIA mass correction is applied, well overlapping total sea level rise observed by Jason-1 and Jason-2 (1.3 ± 0.9 mm/a) within a 95% confidence interval.   

And Chambers et al

> sea level has been rising on average by 1.7 mm/year over the last 110 years  

Further, it appears to have slowed.

>These new calculations highlight a reduction in the rate of sea level rise since 2005, by ~2 mm/yr. **This represents a 60% reduction compared to the 3.3 mm/yr sea level rise (glacial isostatic adjustment correction applied) measured between 1993 and 2005.** Since November 2005, MSL is accurately measured by a single satellite, Jason-1. **However the error analysis performed here indicates that the recent reduction in MSL rate is real.**  

Along with evidence that mankind has no affect on the sea level.

>We propose that: thermal expansion simulated by climate models may previously have been underestimated owing to their not including volcanic forcing in their control state; the rate of glacier mass loss was larger than previously estimated, and was not smaller in the first than in the second half of the century; the Greenland ice-sheet could have made a positive contribution throughout the century; groundwater depletion and reservoir impoundment, which are of opposite sign, may have been approximately equal in magnitude. We show that it is possible to reconstruct the timeseries of GMSLR from the quantified contributions, apart from a constant residual term which is small enough to be explained as a long-term contribution from the Antarctic ice-sheet. The reconstructions account for the approximate constancy of the rate of GMSLR during the 20th century, **which shows small or no acceleration, despite the increasing anthropogenic forcing.** Semi-empirical methods for projecting GMSLR depend on the existence of a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR, **but the implication of our closure of the budget is that such a relationship is weak or absent during the 20th century.**

So no rising heat in the atmosphere, no rising heat from the CRN. Most papers agree it's in the ocean, but the ocean doesn't appear to be responding. So either the heat is negligible, or the ocean is handling it. [I also have studies indicating acidification isn't a concern]   

Ultimately there's no reasons we can't attempt to cut our emissions and work on viable renewable power sources. Like nuclear for instance. Though the heat either appears to be far less than what was predicted, or is having a negligible affect.
