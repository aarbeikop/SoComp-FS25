It was because of her and her amazing documentary Mission Blue that convinced me to stop eating seafood 4 years ago. 

She stays so happy and positive when delivering her messages to the world. She has been diving longer than most of us have been alive. She has seen the before, and the aftermath of human destruction to our oceans. 

Half of the Smithsonian exhibit on ocean life is credited to her hard work all these years. She is the most amazing woman in the world in my opinion, and I hope I get to see her speak one day in my life.

I, for the life of me, cannot understand the point of deniers denying the obvious perfect scientific consensus of AGW.
It’s obvious, to even the most ignorant child, that any errors that may pop up in the sensors outputs, the computer models, or the varied research, such errors are minuscule, benign, & easily corrected by ignoring or simply fixing them.
It’s also obvious that the undeniable scientific consensus of so many scientists in so many disciplines, who have such equitable & perfectly unbiased command over the fixed & perfected climate change data, cannot ever be compared to the oil lobby, car manufacturer lobbies, rightwing lobbies etc.
Why can’t the deniers accept these facts, this scientific reality? There is zero political influence, zero extremist influence, zero human error, in the Anthropogenic Climate Change consensus.

But that is not how science works, ""I demand every argument against astronomy be refuted"".  You have to have a specific argument about an area of a field. 

Since most of the worlds major science academies have publicly supported the mainstream view it will take something a bit more than ""I do not believe it"" to change others opinions.

""In this report we attract attention to a fact that the global maximum of the outer belt energetic electron precipitation is localized in a narrow longitudinal belt centered in the Weddell Sea i.e. in the area of climate warming in the Southern hemisphere. It is shown in this paper that the region of intense global warming around Antarctic peninsula precisely coincides with a stable maximum of energetic electron precipitation (E > 1 MeV) from the Earth radiation belt. Depth of penetration of these particles into atmosphere could be as low as 20-40 km. It was shown by several explorers that energetic resources of this electron precipitation are sufficient to change temperature regime of the stratosphere and troposphere.""

**Missing driver in the Sun–Earth connection from energetic electron precipitation impacts mesospheric ozone**

""Energetic electron precipitation (EEP) from the Earth’s outer radiation belt continuously affects the chemical composition of the polar mesosphere. EEP can contribute to catalytic ozone loss in the mesosphere through ionization and enhanced production of odd hydrogen. However, the long-term mesospheric ozone variability caused by EEP has not been quantified or confirmed to date. Here we show, using observations from three different satellite instruments, that EEP events strongly affect ozone at 60–80 km, leading to extremely large (up to 90%) short-term ozone depletion. This impact is comparable to that of large, but much less frequent, solar proton events. On solar cycle timescales, we find that EEP causes ozone variations of up to 34% at 70–80 km. With such a magnitude, it is reasonable to suspect that EEP could be an important part of solar influence on the atmosphere and climate system.""

“The permanently pumped electromagnetic waves to the ionosphere by the system of broadcasting stations can disturb the nearest space environment. Thus this activity can create in the topside ionosphere local Langmuir turbulence or ion-acoustic turbulence. However theoretical assumptions show that the generation of ion-acoustic turbulence is far more effective. The scattering of super-thermal electrons on ion-acoustic or Langmuir turbulence is proposed as a mechanism of generation of broad-band HF emissions. The HF diagnostics, performed on the low orbiting satellite, detected an enhancement of radiation particularly over the Euro-Asia region. HF emission in the topside ionosphere is more intense over the area correlated with outer radiation belts. It is prominent on the Eastern Hemisphere i.e. some longitudinal effect is manifested. The observed effect is markedly visible, and is stronger in the night-side ionosphere. Strong geomagnetic disturbances can broaden the area of observed intensification of HF noises in comparison with quiet time, but the intensity of the observed enhancement is not affected by eomagnetic disturbances” (Rothkaehl and Klos, 2002) [https://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/823/1/18Rothkaehl.pdf](https://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/823/1/18Rothkaehl.pdf)

**THE MICRO-SATELLITE DEMETER:**

""At VLF frequencies between 10 and 20 kHz, the ground-based transmitters are used for radio-navigation and communications. Their ionospheric perturbations include: the triggering of new waves, ionospheric heating, wave-electron interactions, and particle precipitation.   


At HF frequencies, the broadcasting stations utilise powerful transmitters which can heat the ionosphere and change the temperature and the density. All these wave dissipations in the ionosphere could participate to the global warming of the Earth because the change in global temperature increases the number of natural lightning discharges in the atmosphere. Then the supplementary lightning discharges produce more magnetospheric whistlers which could produce heating and ionization in the lower ionosphere.Furthermore, it is a feedback mechanism because two different processes could be involved. First, lightning is a source of NOx, and NOx affects the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere which contributes to the greenhouse effect. Second, precipitation of energetic electrons by man?made waves may trigger other lightning discharges. It explains the importance of the study of such man-made waves \[7\].""

""When broadcast first began in 1909/10, it was primarily in the VLF range which has been shown to stimulate EEP-NOx through the generation of ionospheric plasma turbulence. In the 1920s when AM really took off, the energy sent through the E layer of the ionosphere continued to cause electron precipitation EEP and the production of NOx to deplete the ozone layer in polar regions which increased UV rays and the heating of Eath, our atmosphere and Greenhouse Gases leading to a subsequent rise in temperature.""

**Contrasting the efficiency of radiation belt losses caused by ducted and nonducted whistler-mode waves from ground-based transmitters:**

DEMETER Observations of NWC‐Produced DLC Enhancements - The powerful U.S. Navy transmitter with call sign “NWC” (19.8 kHz, 1 MW radiated power, North West Cape, Australia, L = 1.45) is extremely well positioned to have a potential influence upon >100 keV electrons in the inner radiation belt; recent studies have confirmed that transmissions from this station lead to significant increases in drift loss cone energetic electron fluxes measured by low‐ Earth‐orbiting spacecraft \[Sauvaud et al., 2008; Gamble et al., 2008\]. The location of NWC is shown in Figure 1. When contrasted with periods when NWC is nonoperational, there are typically **∼430 times more** 100–260 keV electrons present in the drift loss cone across L = 1.67–1.9 due to NWC transmissions \[Gamble et al., 2008\].
