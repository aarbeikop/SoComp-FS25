without credit there would be no investment

>Economics is a notoriously complicated subject. To make things easier, let’s
imagine a simple example.

>Samuel Greedy, a shrewd financier, founds a bank in El Dorado, California.
A. A. Stone, an up-and-coming contractor in El Dorado, finishes his first big job,
receiving payment in cash to the tune of $1 million. 

>He deposits this sum in Mr Greedy’s bank. 

>The bank now has $1 million in capital.

>In the meantime, Jane McDoughnut, an experienced but impecunious El Dorado
chef, thinks she sees a business opportunity – there’s no really good bakery in her
part of town. But she doesn’t have enough money of her own to buy a proper
facility complete with industrial ovens, sinks, knives and pots. She goes to the
bank, presents her business plan to Greedy, and persuades him that it’s a
worthwhile investment. He issues her a $1 million loan, by crediting her account
in the bank with that sum.

>McDoughnut now hires Stone, the contractor, to build and furnish her bakery.

>His price is $1,000,000.

>When she pays him, with a cheque drawn on her account, Stone deposits it in
his account in the Greedy bank.

>So how much money does Stone have in his bank account? 

>Right, $2 million.

>How much money, cash, is actually located in the bank’s safe? 

>Yes, $1 million.

>It doesn’t stop there. As contractors are wont to do, two months into the job
Stone informs McDoughnut that, due to unforeseen problems and expenses, the
bill for constructing the bakery will actually be $2 million. Mrs McDoughnut is not
pleased, but she can hardly stop the job in the middle. So she pays another visit to
the bank, convinces Mr Greedy to give her an additional loan, and he puts
another $1 million in her account. She transfers the money to the contractor’s
account.

>How much money does Stone have in his account now? 

>He’s got $3 million.

>But how much money is actually sitting in the bank? 

>Still just $1 million. 

>In fact, the same $1 million that’s been in the bank all along.

>Current US banking law permits the bank to repeat this exercise seven more
times. 

>The contractor would eventually have $10 million in his account, even
though the bank still has but $1 million in its vaults. 

>Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes. 

>If all of the account holders at Barclays Bank suddenly demand their money, Barclays will promptly collapse (unless the government steps in to save it). The same is true of Lloyds, Deutsche Bank, Citibank, and all other banks in the world.

well, you certainly sound open-minded and optimistic. 

what about using fossil fuels to rebuild the grid and then attempt to reverse things? not even saying that is a good idea but you leave very little space open to discussion when you say anything contrary to my perspective is "" unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.""

a big part of this discussion needs to be winning people over to a new way of thinking. without optimism that it can be done, what's the point? 

what about the people who see the threat but are pessimistic. why work today if the battle is unwinnable? 

I happen to think its totally winnable. we went to the moon after 60 years of flight. cured smallpox. travelled faster than sound. The shift to a green economy is nothing but the next great adventure.

so fight. try. do what you can. buy a tree. talk to people with an open-minded optimistic perspective. lower yourself to this one task and maybe the next hurdle will be easier. 

like will smith said: you don't build great wall by trying to build a wall. you just set one brick as perfectly as one brick can be set, then another and another and sooner or later you have a wall.
