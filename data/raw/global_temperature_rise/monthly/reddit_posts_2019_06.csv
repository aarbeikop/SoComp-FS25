"bvpc7p","climatechange","action-oriented","As a layman, I believe the main killer of climate change will be all the wars it spurs","I've always said the science behind global climate change, appears to pretty solid, and to me talking to a climate change denier is like debating a flat earther.

I want to run this idea past a couple people on here.

Basically Homo Sapiens is 200,000 years old. Besides maybe ideology, and religion, what has been a main motivating factor for wars? Limited resources, and power and control over those resources. When I play Civ V, I gotta delay my civilization's progress if I aim to take out another, but on a cost/benefit analysis that rival civilization's resources are main motivating factor. And I think we got a similar situation here.

We got 7.6 billion people. Population numbers continuing to rise. This can NOT rise indefinitely. And not when climate change is actually going to affect land areas, I.E. where humans live, profoundly more than out in the middle of the ocean, I suspect land is actually going to get a lot hotter than say 4c.

It's not so much the farm lands being turned to desert and displacement of hundreds of millions from coastal cities that scares me...I think this climate change is going to set off potentially the proverbial WWIII. You're gonna have starving masses similar to Soylent Green, they're going to be pissed. We're seeing the rise of nationalists, I'm not getting into politics, but basically instead of humans figuring out a way to share the earth's resources for their survival, they're looking to horde them to themselves. It's the rise of authoritarianism and a look to strong man dictatorships in major countries, that is leading me to see parallel's to the lead up to the WWII situation, except today's weapons are profoundly more destructive than they were in the 1940's.

IIRC they say one of the reasons we may have yet to ever discover intelligent life is because it figured out how to destroy itself, before it figured out interstellar travel. Right now we got the nuclear arsenal the world over to destroy ourselves as opposed to interstellar travel.

So I just wanted to see what others think of this idea of mine.","2019-06-01 20:45:16","82","63","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bvpc7p/as_a_layman_i_believe_the_main_killer_of_climate/","True","SuperJew113","1747904104.8312247","global temperature rise","manual"
"c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented","What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?","I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

&#x200B;

So, I'm writing a book that is set 100 years from now (well, 90ish years). It's got dystopic and apocalyptic themes.. and I was wondering what types of environmental changes would occur in 100 years. I'd like to have the environment play a neat effect in my book, man vs nature, all that jazz. But if it's out of the realm of plausible fiction... then I'll cut that idea.

&#x200B;

**So as for the real question, I was just curious as to what types of events-- any! it could be man-made, environmental, or totally fictional!-- would cause global temperatures to jump to a point that it would change the world around us -- sea levels rising, crops and overall agriculture being affected.** 

&#x200B;

I'm writing in the overall history of my universe right now. My setting is North America, most specifically the Midwest and moving east. I've created a 2030 map that has the US, Canada, and Mexico borders... but i also made a general 2109 map.. where I've made some guesses as to sea levels rising (to a point want as a writer), and I changed country borders and such. 

&#x200B;

All of this to say, I'm trying to map out the changes in North America and I need some guidelines from people who are smarter than me lmao.","2019-06-09 23:32:24","2","16","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/byqohs/what_types_of_man_made_or_natural_events_would/","True","letsplaykate","1747904185.9487634","global temperature rise","manual"
"bz1dax","climatechange","action-oriented","My Opinion","Most of the people around me in my daily life don’t care about climate change whatsoever. However, I personally find it quite disturbing. The thought of a changing globe and the conflicts and problems that come with it, such as rising oceans and and increased extreme weather events make me feel guilty for being one of the contributors to such a horrendous event.
  
Global warming is almost definitely going to happen, and even the naysayers must agree that any work done to prevent climate change could only lead to a healthier planet in the long run. Yet many people choose to ignore al the evidence piling up, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, increased numbers of extreme weather events, and the fact that all these seem to coincide with the massive amounts of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere every year. 

I have decided that I will try and reduce my own emissions if no one near me will, if not to set an example then to simply reduce my own guilt. I will reduce the amount of meat I eat and the emissions I emit by driving by using active and public transportation more frequently, as my current lifestyle doesn’t follow a “healthier planet” vision.

"c0wys3","climatechange","action-oriented","Study - Air temperature changes in the arctic from 1801 to 1920 -","Link to the study:

https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/joc.1918

This is an overlooked study that comes to very different conclusions about past arctic temperatures than do proxy studies. 

Some key points:

 - ""On average, the Arctic as a whole was colder by 0.8C"" 

(Which is exactly the global rise reported today) 

 - ""Annual mean temperatures in all the 20-year periods and in all climatic regions were colder than today .... Differences generally are less  than  2C""

 - ""significantly colder autumns were observed in the period 1801 – 1860 in comparison with the
period 1861 – 1920."" 

(That lines up perfectly with LIA conditions)

 - ""The  greatest  discrepancies between the real Arctic and the Subarctic occurred in spring. The former was only a little colder than it is at present (by 0.2C), whereas the latter experienced quite significant cooling (by 1.1C)""

(That shows very little change near the pole and greater change in the sub-arctic. So, the spring melt was slower in most years than we see today}

 - ""... Canadian and Baffin Bay regions, where, on average, April was warmer than today by 0.3C. On the other hand, negative differences (−0.3C, i.e. colder conditions than present) were observed in the Atlantic
and Pacific regions.""

(This implies that there is far more regional variability in arctic temperature conditions than is generally noted)

 - ""The results show that air temperatures in the Arctic from 1801 to 1920 were not as exceptionally cold as has been suggested by some analyses of proxy data""

(So, modern reports of a major increase in arctic temperatures are likely exaggerated.)

 - ""Throughout the whole study period, the majority of mean monthly temperatures lie within one [SD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) from the modern mean.""

(Which means that about 80% of the measurements are within a normal range of temperature variability)

Most significant is the conclusion that the period 1800-60 was colder in all arctic regions than the period 1861-1920. That means that warming was already occurring in the arctic and sub-arctic well before any warming could be attributed to human causes.","2019-06-15 12:52:14","3","1","0.71","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/c0wys3/study_air_temperature_changes_in_the_arctic_from/","True","there_ARE_watches","1747904216.9609692","global temperature rise","manual"

The tl;dr is - 

**The ugly:**

* energy-generation emissions rose in 2018 (fastest rise since 2011)
* Natural gas emissions grew the most: 4.6% from 2017 to 2018
* methane is soaring, most likely due to jumps in oil and natural gas

**The bad:**

* if all existing government commitments are implemented, we don't even keep temperature increase below 3C by 2100;
* some countries (USA, Russia, Saudi, Turkey) aren't even close to their commitments, which on that trajectory pushes us well past 3C;
* renewables are stalling

**The good:**

* global warming rated top global threat by 67% of respondents in 2018 (up from 63% in 2017)

So where are we at right now when it comes to a sustainable future? Below are some of the key findings from MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group, who have been tracking corporate sustainability for the past eight years.

[https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/corporate-sustainability-at-a-crossroads/?utm\_medium=referral&utm\_source=authors&utm\_campaign=susrpt17](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/corporate-sustainability-at-a-crossroads/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=authors&utm_campaign=susrpt17)

&#x200B;

**Key Lesson #1: Set your sustainability vision and ambition:** 90% of executives see sustainability as important, but only 60% of companies have a sustainability strategy.

&#x200B;

**Key Lesson #2: Focus on material issues:** Companies that focus on material issues report up to 50% added profit from sustainability. Those that don’t focus on their material issues struggle to add value from their sustainability activities.

&#x200B;

**Key Lesson #3: Set up the right organization to achieve your ambition:** Building sustainability into business units doubles an organization’s chance of profiting from its sustainability activities.

&#x200B;

**Key Lesson #4: Explore business model innovation opportunities:** Nearly 50% of companies have changed their business models as a result of sustainability opportunities.

&#x200B;

**Key Lesson #5: Develop a clear business case for sustainability:** While 60% of companies have a sustainability strategy, only 25% have developed a clear business case for their sustainability efforts.

&#x200B;

**Key Lesson #6: Get the board of directors on board:** 86% of respondents agreed that boards should play a strong role in their company’s sustainability efforts, but only 48% say their CEOs are engaged, and fewer (30%) agreed that their sustainability efforts had strong board-level oversight.

&#x200B;

**Key Lesson #7: Develop a compelling sustainability value-creation story for investors:** 75% of executives in investment companies think sustainability performance should be considered in investment decisions, but only 60% of corporate executives think investors care about sustainability performance.

&#x200B;

From this same study it was found that 90% of companies say collaborations are necessary to succeed with sustainability. The survey respondents say the diversity and number of collaborations will continue to grow in the years ahead. Before 2000, 40% of companies surveyed had no collaborations on sustainability efforts, and 19% had just one to three collaborations. In 2014, they found that most companies were engaged in some form of sustainability collaboration and fully 16% of respondents said they expected to have more than 50 collaborations in the future.

With these key findings it's abundantly clear that sustainability not only presents opportunities from a financial and sustainable standpoint, but also a relationship standpoint. There a numerous examples of companies that have worked together to create exceptional results. Partnerships can break down the traditional barriers of competition with brands looking to each other for support. Rivals such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo and Unilever and P&G joined forces to develop more sustainable refrigeration, while in the Côte d’Ivoire a government-business initiative sees 12 of the world’s largest chocolate and cocoa companies, including Nestlé and Mars, working together to help farmers meet the growing demand for cocoa.

&#x200B;

Collaboration is becoming easier and easier to facilitate on both a small and large scale. There are numerous global online networks designed specifically for collaboration. A couple of examples include [sustainabilityconnected.com](https://sustainabilityconnected.com) (primarily focussed on global collaboration to tackle sustainability challenges), [www.commonobjective.co](https://www.commonobjective.co), (primarily focussed on fashion industry specific supply chains), and even [https://www.bsr.org/en/colab](https://www.bsr.org/en/colab) (primarily focussed on consulting & research).

With the rise & success of collaboration, the question is, are you thinking about collaboration in your organisation, and why?","2019-06-03 07:57:05","22","13","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bw844o/collaboration_for_sustainability_success/","True","alexfranklin365","1747904843.402795","global temperature rise","manual"
