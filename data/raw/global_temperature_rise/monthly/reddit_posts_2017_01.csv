"5mmt9o","climatechange","action-oriented","Q: Assuming each year is warmer than the last...","Based on the report that said 2016 was the warmest year yet in a series of increasingly warmer years, I have a question.

Most people in the Western 1st world aren't actively concerned about climate change because it doesn't effect them on a day to day basis. When will it? 

Like, at what point do crops fail for years at a time, leading to massive price hikes in basic staples? Or famine? Something that would make the average person stop worrying about Trump or Kardashian, and actually start lamenting that we didn't do something sooner.

Like, many reports have said the 2 degree temperature rise at the end of the century is what we need to avoid. But if each year the temp goes up by .2 degrees, we'd hit that 2 degree limit by 2027.","2017-01-07 21:10:29","6","37","0.69","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/5mmt9o/q_assuming_each_year_is_warmer_than_the_last/","True","jrf_1973","1747872480.0131075","global temperature rise","manual"
