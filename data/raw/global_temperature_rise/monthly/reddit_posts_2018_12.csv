"a7l4w7","climatechange","action-oriented","Which climate scientists have most influenced you?","I'll share a list of mine and some highlights of how they have shaped my understanding.

1. John Tyndall

Over 150 years ago, he demonstrated the greenhouse effect of GHG's like CO2. 


2. James Hansen

Generally, his passion for the topic has caused me to dig deeper.


3. Dr. Jennifer Francis - Rutgers

Her explanation of how climate change is effecting weather patterns, specifically via altering the Jet Stream and Circumpolar wind currents resulting in stuck weather patterns (more extreme rainfall and heat waves)

4. Karen Pistone

Led a 2014 study quantifying the impact of lost albedo in the Arctic which concluded that lost albedo was causing warming equivalent to 50% of all cumulative anthropogenic emissions.

5. Dr. Eric Rignot - NASA and UCI

His specialty is the satellite and radar measurement of the cryosphere. A few years back he claimed that big portions of W. Antarctica were melting irreversibly. Digging into this claim and understanding the ocean / ice interface and the topography under the ice sheets tipped me into a heightened concern about climate change 2 years ago.

Some of his work incorporates the work of Jennifer Francis and the understanding of how changing ocean currents are bringing warm water to the ice sheets.

6. DeConto and Pollard

Developed the theory of Marine Ice Sheet Instability which is a potential missing link in understanding how ice sheets can rapidly disintegrate as they have in recent geologic past. ~ 15k years ago, sea levels rose ~ 1 foot per decade for ~ 500 years. 

That ice is now long gone and we won't see an exact repeat of that. But they have put together a lot of elements which help modelers reconcile their warming models to past sea level rise. 

The proof will be in the data in the coming decade or two. Just a theory for now.

7. Dr. Kerry Emanuel MIT

His specialty is in extreme weather and hurricane prediction. His work points to more intense and wet storms resulting from climate change, albeit with less storm formation intensity. 

8. Jeff Donnelly, Woods Hole

Has made strides in paleo-evidence of hurricane activity. Using ocean holes where sediments collect, he's able to reconstruct storm activity for several millennia. Combining that with oxygen isotope ratios which enable a reconstruction of ocean temperatures, a solid relationship between storm intensity and ocean temperature.

9. Charles Keeling and historical CO2 mappers. 

CO2 isn't the only GHG, but it's a good proxy. Understanding the GHG's are at a 5M year high and likely to hit a 20M year high in my lifetime is pretty significant. 

That's my core list. I'm interested to add to that list based upon the feedback of others.

I do not think that climate change is not happening but it seems very hard to get a good idea of the scale of the change when good scientists have good arguments backed by data on both sides.

Any good recent articles that adresses all the CON arguments and data and why they may not be right? It's already very easy to find arguments on the PRO side.","2018-12-18 17:43:27","0","25","0.45","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/a7dadm/any_good_recent_article_refuting_climate_change/","True","fastfwd","1747894235.8166616","global temperature rise","manual"
"a3dw3y","climatechange","action-oriented","The Broadcast Theory of Climate Change","The Broadcast Theory website was created 10 years ago to help me understand the atmospheric phenomena we've been witnessing with regards to climate change. It was supposed to be a website about CO2, buuuut after diving into the various theories and arguments I learned that it might be waaay more complex as there's also variation in the UV that heats CO2. So I began to look at how greenhouse gases, the sun and ozone depletion might be working together as part of a bigger picture that might have other perhaps even unconsidered influences closer to home.

While pondering other ways we could affect our atmosphere, I wondered if broadcast could have an effect. Looking at the WMO global temperature anomalies graph I noticed that the warming trend actually started about the same time as broadcast 1909/10 and that variations in the graph matched our historic use of broadcast at that time. In all honesty at first I didn't believe it. But diving in deeper I discovered that the E layer of the ionosphere has a natural frequency of \~1400kHz which also happens to fall in the AM broadcast band.

This is as it turns out is called a gyrofrequency and it along with 2.45GHz (microwave/wifi) can be stimulated effectively causing a phenomena in the polar regions called Energetic Electron Precipitation or EEP. Ionospheric stimulation in the VLF or gyrofrequency range creates plasma turbulence (Alfven Electrostatic Ion Cyclotron plasma waves) in the ionosphere that stimulate the EEP-NOx process.

This was first discovered with the MINIX rocket mission to determine if the Solar Powered Satellites were a viable space based project. It was not in part because these frequencies were deemed problematic in the ionosphere.

After learning that gyro frequencies fell in the AM Broadcast band and about the EEP-NOx process I then discovered that this EEP-NOx process depletes ozone as much as CFCs or Solar Proton Events and there were a few of the world's leading ionospheric physicists Michel Parrot to leads the DEMETER microsatellite mission with CNES France and Bo Thide with the Swedish Institute of Space Physics who had also raised concerns about this specific mechanism involving EEP-NOx and it's possible impacts on our climate system.

Bo Thide wrote a paper titled, ""Atmosphere-Ionosphere-Mission, an Elaborate Science Case"" in which he put out a call for ideas regarding this REP/EEP climate forcing mechanism saying that the public should be concerned. Bo Thide is one of the world's leading ionospheric physicists. He wrote the book on Electromagnetic Field Theory and single handedly revolutionized our understanding of ionospheric research with multi channel ionospheric probing; awarding him the Edlund Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1991.

The Broadcast Theory website was created to catalog any and all data and scientific research relating to the Transmitter Induced REP/EEP-NOx \~ ozone depletion process. It looks at our historic use of broadcast frequencies and how those frequencies interact with our ionosphere and EEP-NOx according to modern research. It explores the possibility that broadcast induced (EEP-NOx) ozone depletion causes an increase in UV that heats the Earth's surface, our atmosphere and greenhouse gases like CO2 and water vapor.

So I invite you to dive into the world of Broadcast Theory and learn of the many other ionospheric physicists that see broadcast and EEP-NOx as a potentially growing concern in our atmosphere and learn a little about the history of broadcast too.

"a6pnrn","sustainability","action-oriented","#EarthStrike is a series of global protests leading up to a worldwide general strike/work stoppage on September 27, 2019. Help out by spreading the word and helping to organize action in your local area!","#earthstrike

The world’s leading climate scientists have warned us that we have until 2030 to prevent temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius. That’s a little over twelve years - by environmental standards, the blink of an eye.

If we let the world’s temperature rise by a little over 2 degrees Celsius, the results will be catastrophic - sea levels will rise to untenable levels, heat waves will become far more common, freshwater will become even more scarce, and many more effects besides.

The time to act is now before it’s too late. According to the CDP’s Carbon Majors Report of 2017, 71% of the world’s global industrial greenhouse gases emissions come from just 100 companies. It is clear that the interests of big business no longer drive the prosperity of the human race. As a society, we need to change our course. 

For this reason, we will be organizing 3 global protests; 15th of January 2019, 27th April 2019 and the 1st of August 2019. All of that will be leading up the 27th of September where we will hold a global general strike, we need to make the world’s governments and the world’s businesses listen to the people, and the best way to do that is by refusing to participate in those businesses and governments. There will be no banking, no offices full of employees or schools full of children.
