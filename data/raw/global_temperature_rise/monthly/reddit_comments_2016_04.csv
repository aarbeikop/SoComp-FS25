Coral reefs around the world are dying with the Great Barrier Reef taking a major hit this year. Ocean acidification attacking the shells of  small plankton could cripple some of the oceans food chains. Oyster farmers in the NW US cannot start oysters in the ocean because it is too acidic already so they have to be started in tanks on land.
Northern areas are getting much less snow and for shorter periods which is changing the albedo along with the melting sea ice.

Still with all this information about half the population still does not understand what is coming down the pipe and how quickly.

Climate change videos on YouTube don't have many visits but Katy Perry videos get 1.3 billion views. I can't believe how many of my friends still just don't get it at all.

Soldiers fought and died for our freedom in WW2 in horrid conditions. Our generation won't even look at climate change information. It's not that we tried and failed - most people were too weak to look or too stupid to listen.

If we are seeing this much change now with a with 1 degree change I feel so sorry for young people as large feed backs such as the loss of the reflective ice and snow in the north and Arctic will continue to ramp up, and as the article states the warming is accelerating quickly.

Too many overly fertile knuckle dragging neanderthals roaming the planet.","2016-04-02 07:09:29","11","extinction6","1747863941.928285","global temperature rise","manual"
