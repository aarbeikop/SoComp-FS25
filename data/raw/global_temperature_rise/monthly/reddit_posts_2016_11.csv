"5dbd91","climate","scientific","Asking your help for a decent research","Hello everyone! I should make a research for school about the climate and the global warming.
Let's be clear, i don't want anyone to do my job, i just wanted to ask you if there is some particular article, document, site, video, documentary or graphic, that you prefer, in order to make it richer, since it is a topic which i would like to explain in the best and most interesting way i can, in order to leave something in the people who will be listening to me.
Thanks!","2016-11-16 20:05:30","2","5","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/5dbd91/asking_your_help_for_a_decent_research/","True","Swegoteo","1747870774.259517","global temperature rise","manual"
