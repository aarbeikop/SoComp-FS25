That the temperature went up so fast the last 3, 4 years is mostly a fluctuation around this long-term. Most likely next year will be cooler than this year, while long-term warming will continue. This blog post explains it quite well and shows the temperature curve, which has always shown short-term fluctuations. http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-we-dont-know-if-it-will-be-sunny-next-month-but-we-know-itll-be-hot-all-year/","2017-01-07 23:06:20","8","VictorVenema","1747872480.5933282","global temperature rise","manual"

Infrequent, damaging events become more likely. More frequent. A big part of belief is proximity; so people that experience a drought, say, will become more open, on average, to mitigative or adaptive action. Whether that drought would not have occurred without human action is unknowable.","2017-01-07 23:59:46","5","fishsticks40","1747872480.5933282","global temperature rise","manual"

It will move north like 5 miles in their lifetimes.

Everything else is swamped by other effects, like sea level rise is not even noticeable compared to coastal erosion.

Positive effects, however, are already being felt. Co2 is accelerating all plant growth globally, by about 30%. This means cheaper food, more density in forests, etc.

Put it this way, compared to the coming technological explosion about to happen with self driving cars, robotics, biotech, etc... global warming will be a distant oddity in science history, and solved, by the time the effects would matter.","2017-01-08 16:01:56","3","FireFoxG","1747872480.6073484","global temperature rise","manual"

Well, if that were true, then we'd have something to worry about.  It's not true.

>But if each year the temp goes up by .2 degrees, we'd hit that 2 degree limit by 2027.

Again, this is completely false. You might as well worry about whether or not the moon will fall on your head.  The temperature in the US is about the same now as it was in 1930.  We had a lot of cooling, and we've just now recovered fully from that cooling.  On a longer scale, the 1930s was a warm peak after slow give-and-take warming from the 1600s.  Before that, we had cooling from the peak of temperatures between 900 and 1100 AD.  We're just now seeing warmer temperatures than the Medieval Warm Period in the northern hemisphere.  We may or may not be warmer than the Roman Warm Period, and it's pretty certain that we have not yet matched the temperatures of the Minoan Warm Period.

>But if each year the temp goes up by .2 degrees, we'd hit that 2 degree limit by 2027.

Current rural temperature records show that we're warming by something closer to 0.013º per year, about 6% of the warming you're worried about.","2017-01-08 17:04:22","3","deck_hand","1747872480.6073484","global temperature rise","manual"

Most effects on humans are local not global making it difficult to predict a specific date it'll happen. We already have some 1 in 100 year flood plains turned into much more regular flood plains. Some of the urban coast of Florida is flooded every year. The Syrian civil war has been attributed to the extremely unusual (less than one a century) bad drought and crop failure. I expect most effects on humans to be refugee related for the next few decades as a river drying up or a flood causes a migration with huge knock on effects. Later on things like [this](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/science/climate-change-could-make-parts-of-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-uninhabitable-a7010811.html%3famp) will become blatant impacts of global warming on humans.

However the US will always be able to afford to ship in food from elsewhere suggesting they can keep watching their TVs.","2017-01-08 10:33:57","3","lost_send_berries","1747872480.6073484","global temperature rise","manual"
"dc5mlep","t3_5mmt9o","5mmt9o","climatechange","action-oriented","We can't just buy every item on the internet as being accurate or even truthful. AGW is political and the ploitical wing of NASA does as it's told. That report about 2016 being warmer is based on NASA's GHCN data set. Their page describes how they massage that data. All other data sets show 2016 cooling and cooler than 2015. [Here's HadCrut](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2015/to:2017/mean:1/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2015/to:2016/mean:1/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2016/to:2017/mean:1/trend) which is the most commonly used data. Plug in any other data set and you'll see a similar result.

You may be aware of the pause. The data sets differ on the length of that pause but the fact of it flies in the face of AGW. You may not be aware however of natural climate cycles. The LIA ended ~1850 and so temperatures had nowhere to go but up. There is no evidence that the warming of today is any different from past warming periods, so doom-scenarios are nothing but speculative fiction. A big problem we have today is that it's becoming harder for people to separate fact and fiction given the sheer mass of information.
