"6ebg9o","climate","scientific","Comment to Heartland climate mailing article","I can't speak about Heartland Institute, and I haven't read the book talked about in the classroom, but I have looked back at the experiments/data used to show that CO2/GHGs are THE cause for climate change. Aside from using averaged temperature data ( a no-no as it can introduce bias and error) and correlations as proof, the studies did not look at all possible factors that could affect climate change and global warming. 
The past three years or so have completely debunked this as at the cause. The atmospheric CO2/GHGs did not increase to go along with the warmer temperatures and climate changes during this period. However, Earth was shown to be the likely cause during this time. Core heat was released through the tectonic plates at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean at the East Pacific Rise and a molten iron river/jet flowed eastward under Russia ( permafrost melting) and Alaska/Canada ( glacial arctic ice melting).
I do believe in climate change, but human-related causes are only a minor part and following the Paris Agreement, which is a politically motivated agreement, would do little to modify the causes and effects of climate change.","2017-05-31 00:34:56","0","3","0.29","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/6ebg9o/comment_to_heartland_climate_mailing_article/","True","laupnitram","1747876567.0583389","global temperature rise","manual"
