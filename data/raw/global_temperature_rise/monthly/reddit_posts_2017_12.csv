"7hq1dr","collapse","skeptical","A prescient warning from 1962: ""Modern man’s despoliation of the environment is global in scope....a growing blanket of carbon dioxide will lead to rising atmospheric temperatures, more violent air circulation, more destructive storm patterns, and the melting of the ice caps.""","This was said by a guy called Murray Bookchin, a self-described anarchist and ecologist who argued that humans needed to reshape economic and social systems around ecological principles. This is a simplification of his beliefs, which shifted over time, and I'm sure others on here are more familiar with his ideas, which despite being largely ridiculed during his life (he died in 2006), are now gaining some traction. [Here's one of his more influential pamphlets from which the title quote is taken.](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/lewis-herber-murray-bookchin-ecology-and-revolutionary-thought)

What I struggle with in his writings is his belief that humans are not inherent environmental degraders; the system we have created leads to that outcome, but human kind has the ability to be creative stewards of the earth, utilising what he calls ""humanistic"" technology. I'm interested in what others in the sub think of this premise. It's obvious to anyone with half an eye on trends, that capitalism, and the modern bureaucratic nation state, is struggling to assert legitimacy. And when it inevitably ends, something is going to come next. And that something will be planned by humans. So are there modes of society and economy that could creatively steward the environment? Does the tribal experience show that it's possible to live in balance with nature? Or do past examples of pre-industrial life present just as many problems (e.g. over-fishing and the wiping out of the megafauna)? Do we need to regress to a stone age level of society, or would we still be environmental degraders? Can we create a society with any level of modernity and complexity while also living in harmony with nature?
