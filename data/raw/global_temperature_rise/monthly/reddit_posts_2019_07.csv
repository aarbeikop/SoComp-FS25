"cgft25","climatechange","action-oriented","Implications of paper: ""Strengthening tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient consistent with rising greenhouse gases""","A recent paper in Nature ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0505-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0505-x)) indicates that current state of the art climate models may need to be updated. Quote: "" The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change in the many regions sensitive to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures."" I'm wondering to what extent current models may indeed need to be updated and to what extent the updated models are likely to predict relatively less mean global warming by 2100? The last sentence suggests ""continuing La Nina-like trends"" which might imply somewhat lower warming though still extreme weather volatility (more droughts in one region, more rainfall in another)? Quote: ""However, the strength of the tropical Pacific influence on global climate implies that past and future trends will diverge from those simulated by coupled climate models that, due to their cold tongue bias, misrepresent the response of the tropical Pacific to rising CO2. Until state-of-the-art models more faithfully represent the observed tropical Pacific, climate impact assessments should consider the consequences for the global hydroclimate of continuing La Niña-like trends in tropical Pacific SSTs""

"cef8pi","climate","scientific","Climate Change and Heat Waves in India","Today, because of global warming, the world is one degree Celsius warmer than it was before the industrial revolution. According to author Wallace-Wells, if the temperature rises even one more degree, “Cities now home to millions, across India and the Middle East, would become so hot that stepping outside in summer would be a lethal risk.” In India, exposure to heat waves is said to increase by 8 times between 2021 and 2050, and by 300 % by the end of this century. (See article: “Heat wave exposure in India in current, 1.5 °C, and 2.0 °C worlds,” in the journal *Environmental Research Letters)*. The number of Indians exposed to heat waves increased by 200% from 2010 to 2016. Heat waves also affect farm labour productivity.

The heat waves affect central and northwestern India the most, and the eastern coast and Telengana have also been affected. In 2015, the latter places witnessed at least 2500 deaths. For the first time in history, Kerala reported a heat wave in 2016. The government is being advised by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in predicting and mitigating heat waves. The government of Andhra Pradesh, for instance, is creating a Heat Wave Action Plan.

Clearly, heat waves are indicative of the impacts of climate change which needs to be addressed immediately.

"c802l1","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2019 q2","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for three and a half year now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.

**1.It is safe:**

There is no harm to us or environment while using renewable energy, like fossil fuels, it doesn’t create any type of radiation or any harmful gases while producing renewable energy. 

**2.It is abundant:**

Renewable energy is present in abundant form it is never ending as compared to fossil fuels which are going to extinct one day for sure. Like for example sun rises every day, waves and winds are going to flow every day too, and we can create much energy through these sources. 

**3.It is clean to use:**

There is no harm in using renewable energy sources it is clean and safe to use. It won’t affect or give raise to pollution or any type of threat that accelerates global warming. Hence, it is clean to use renewable energy in terms of fossil fuels.
