Warming through 2C is net positive (that's actually why that target was chosen), but every change has winners and losers.  Warming helps the North, but hurts the tropics.

I think it's like asking if child separation or climate change is more urgent; they're both important, and fortunately there are a lot of people in the world, so we can tackle multiple serious issues in parallel without making the mistake of writing off certain issues as being less ""urgent"" according to some arbitrary definition of what ""urgent"" means.","2018-06-29 16:13:31","8","janequeo","1747888854.646346","global temperature rise","manual"
"e1hvayu","t3_8uqjw3","8uqjw3","climatechange","action-oriented","On the Urgency Ladder, it's probably very hard to beat poverty and disease (very debilitating, widespread and inexpensively treatable diseases, at least). 

Maybe we can argue about to what extent those are environmental problems. But it's reasonably easy to show that deforestation might actually be a useful tool in fighting those problems. 

So any objective analysis of urgency on these issues gets really complex, really quickly. It's probably better to analyze these problems in terms of their solutions: Try to price the costs of meaningful units of improvement, and have some way of quantifying what the risks are. That at least gets you closer to building an investment model that lots of people can sign onto.","2018-06-29 13:19:23","0","DocHarford","1747888854.646346","global temperature rise","manual"

"e0j7vd2","t3_8qh4ik","8qh4ik","climate","scientific","It is indeed good the discuss this to get a good picture of the science, thanks for the question.

An important benefit is tourism in quite a few countries. People like recreating in hot weather more. An other important benefit is that adaptation usually has a lot of co\-benifits. You could imagine cities planting more trees to provide shade, which has the additional benefit of providing more location to chill out and enjoy some nature.

Some new research has come out on the weather\-related mortality, which is point to flaws in research that shows weather related mortality goes down: [http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2018/06/will\-climate\-change\-bring\-benefits\-from\-reduced\-cold\-related\-mortality\-insights\-from\-the\-latest\-epidemiological\-research/](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2018/06/will-climate-change-bring-benefits-from-reduced-cold-related-mortality-insights-from-the-latest-epidemiological-research/). They find that in most regions weather related deaths (in summer) instead go up faster than the decrease in winter if no adaptation finds place.

In terms of agriculture: these effects are also probably negative on a world scale. All plants have a benefit from CO2 fertilization, but the heat and water stress in most agricultural land increases. Locally of course some countries will become more fertile.

I'm also not entirely sure about a net decrease in energy consumption. Of course, heating costs will go down globally, but some countries like the US use air conditioning in a lot of houses. If that technology also gets widespread use in Europe and Asia, energy consumption might increase again..
