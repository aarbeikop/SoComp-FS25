But for the Syrian Civil War they would be at low for perhaps the past few hundred years. 

&#x200B;

Wars between democracies are virtually unheard off. And the increasing globalisation of communication, travel and business means more and more people are used to interacting with people from other places and gaining insight into their perspectives. 

Over the next 50 years the median age of most countries will grow rapidly as the demographic transition pushing more countries into a Japan like demography of an ageing and shirking population. 

Low carbon energy is already competing on a cost for cost basis with fossil fuels and this trend will only accentuate. 

China and India have the Himalayas between them, China and America an ocean, Russia has nothing resembling the kind of logistics tail or hardware numbers to roll into Poland let alone further south. The Thaar desert has mean India and Pakistans wars have been border conflicts with very limited goals. The idea of a war between Europes traditional rivals is nonsense. North America is even more stable. Id struggle to see Argentina and Brazil renewing their 19th century violent history. Much of Asia is rapidly industrialising and becoming part of a globalised world, following ROK, Japan and Taiwan into the western outlook. 

Modern industrialised nation states are unlikely to be all that destabalised over the next 50 years as we head towards 2C of warming. 

Where flash points do exist is in the poorly governed and out right despotic states across regions like the MENA (Middle East North Africa) and sub Saharan Africa. Here development is currently low enough that food makes up a significant part of the personal budget, thus changes in food price drive individuals towards under nourishment. 

But these issues can be ameliorated by effective international aid. 

If we have an increase in climate related wars then they will be civil wars against despots, driven by lack of outside help and lack of internal development. 

I can see nothing inevitable about climate related wars in a sub 2C warmer world causing destabilisation on a scale to really see a return to the kind of deaths rates from violence we had in the early 40s.","2019-06-02 05:46:45","17","[deleted]","1747904105.4614925","global temperature rise","manual"

However, there is one ray of hope. The world of the early 20th century - the world wars - was full of people who were convinced of their inherent moral, genetic, and cultural superiority.

The U.S. still had segregation, and of course there were the Nazis, but I didn't want to start with the Nazis, lol.

We manifestly do not live in that world. Yes, we see more racism and anti-immigrant sentiment as times get tougher (white supremacy is on the rise). But the public at large and the powers that be do not have an \_entrenched worldview\_ of racial or genetic superiority.

You know what the biggest difference is between climate science in the 70s versus now? It's a trick question, because no major technology breakthrough has altered any of the early predictions. It was solid science back then. 

That's why Exxon Mobil started its own in house world class climate change research in the late 70s, to get a handle on the magnitude of the problem. Over the next 5 years it would go on to confirm all the worst established predictions from academic research and go beyond it. Investigative journalism revealed that they predicted very accurately what the concentration greenhouse gasses would rise to by 2020. They knew 50 years in advance we would have surpassed 400ppm by now, almost double the 'natural' level. They knew that by now the first undeniable signs of severe clays change would become apparent. It was a time when this problem could be solved with a relatively painless energy transition, avoiding the worst outcomes. 

Knowing all this, Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it.

The “power” that warms the Earth above the 3 Kelvin of outer space (not absolute zero) is the sun. It pushes over 1300 watts per square meter of energy into Earths system on the approximately 50% of the Earth where the sun shines.  Clouds, the surface of the oceans, ice, and the surface itself reflect some of that energy away.  Part of that energy is absorbed by the atmosphere before it ever reaches the surface. Some of that energy makes it through the atmosphere, past the clouds and is absorbed by the surface. The Earth radiates away the same amount of energy, but the radiation isn’t confined to the dark side of the planet. 

The surface radiates energy, but so does the atmosphere. All matter radiates energy based on the composition of the matter and the temperature. So, a warm atmosphere will radiate energy to space without that energy having come from the surface in the form of IR in the frequency that CO2 can capture. A GHG molecule, such as water vapor, will radiate in IR based on the temperature of that molecule, and it will cool via radiation. 

All other things being equal, more GHGs in the atmosphere must cause increased levels of IR radiation from the atmosphere, with half of that radiation going upwards and away from the surface.  The very first and most reliable test of Climate Change would be the IR brightness of the mid-troposphere. We should have a quantifiable and very easily demonstrated gauge of climate change simply by measuring the change in IR bouncing around at various levels in the atmosphere.","2019-06-16 13:04:03","4","deck_hand","1747904143.9756632","global temperature rise","manual"
"erbzawt","t3_c18wl0","c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented"," - The reason it's detrimental 

It's about effectively framing runaway warming as a threat to us, instead of a threat to wildlife and somewhat of an inconvenience we can engineer our way around:

""We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius

The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years. Adding another 4 degrees Celsius to the top of the natural ice age - warm age temperature cycle.

Calling it global warming doesn't reveal the the implications of the problem the way climate change does. If the mean temperature increases world wide by 2 degrees, than you should not expect the same basic conditions but slightly warmer. Instead, it means macro shifts. 

For instance a monsoon that shifts in landfall location by hundreds of miles will cause droughts where it used to land and floods where it settles. Imagine water shortages for a city like new Delhi with 20+ million people. Imagine failed crops.

Besides warming, 2 degrees will be accompanied with rising sea levels and ocean acidification. This combination of effects is how 2 degrees is projected to eradicate tropical and sub tropical such as the great barrier reef which had been around the time the giant meteor eradicated the dinosaurs and which is the size of Western Europe. Further warming with its accompanied effects may critically reduce other sea life to the extent that it can no longer be relied on to feed three coastal populations in south East Asia.

A planet doesn't need an atmosphere to be warm. The radiation a planet receives from the sun needs to be irradiated out. This is called Radiative Equilibrium.

Now, a planet doesn't emit its own visible light. But it can emit infrared. How? By having a temperature. So the more energy it gets from the sun, the hotter the planet needs to be to maintain Radiative Equilibrium. In other words, it needs to have a Planetary Equilibrium Temperature.

When a planet has an atmosphere, its surface temperature is higher than the theoretical Planetary Equilibrium Temperature. Venus is an extreme example of this. It's because greenhouse gases block infrared, so the planet has to be hotter to maintain Radiative Equilibrium.","2019-06-17 03:06:18","2","j-solorzano","1747904143.9826634","global temperature rise","manual"

3. A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

4. We do see it in first world countries! The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.","2019-06-16 12:32:02","1","Macralicious","1747904143.9862077","global temperature rise","manual"

---

So let's debunk this methane silliness. Here are the salient points:

- Methane represents about 15% of the change in radiative forcing from GHGs over the last century.^1

- Atmospheric methane increased more rapidly during the 20th century than it has this century, both in absolute terms and in terms of percent of total methane.^2

- Methane has a halflife of about 8.6 years. That means that of a given quantity of methane released into the atmosphere today, half will remain in 8.6 years, a quarter in 17.2 years, an eighth in 25.8 years, etc.^3 

- More methane is released from cows, natural wetlands, rice paddies, or biomass burning than is released from the permafrost.^4

- More methane is released from leaks in gas lines than is released from the permafrost.^4 

- The forcing from methane follows the square root of concentration.^5

Putting all of this together, then, says that the future change in radiative forcing due to methane will be marginal. Even if more methane is released from permafrost than is currently observed, that can be offset by changing how we grow rice or better monitoring of gas lines or even changing what we feed cows.

If you want something that's realistic (which is the only kind of sci-fi I will read; I don't like sci-fantasy because it invokes magic as a lazy solution to the author's lack of imagination), there are a few things people could do to increase temperatures.

- A rogue group could spray black carbon across marginal ice regions. Think something fine, like black toner. This would cause the reflective ice to melt, causing more warming.

- A group could focus on producing a really nasty GHG like sulfur hexaflouride (SF6). It has **23,500 times** the 100 year GHG equivalent of CO2. It's also less than 10 parts per trillion in the atmosphere right now, which means that adding it bunch to the atmosphere would result in a forcing directly proportional to concentration. (At higher concentrations, GHGs follow functions of diminishing returns.) Not only that, SF6 has a really long atmospheric residency. It's a nightmare GHG.

"eqmv143","t3_byqohs","byqohs","climatechange","action-oriented","Well, the most plausible (but still unlikely...) event would be a 50 Gigatonne burst of methane from the ESAS. It has been speculated by a pair of experts that study the area. Methane is roughly 120 times stronger than CO2 when it is initially emitted (It could be higher, but I've never seen a properly cited source that indicates that.), meaning that 50GtC x 120 = 6000 GtCO2. Roughly 768 PPM CO2e.  


50 Gigatonnes of CO2 would be roughly 0.03 degrees celsius, 0.03 x 120 = 3.6 degrees celsius. This is including other forcings, such as water vapor and ozone. I've heard some scientists claim that it is in fact 150 times stronger shortly after release, but as I noted earlier I haven't seen any relevant source to prove that. I'll add it for the hell of it: 0.03 x 150 = 4.5 degrees celsius. But that warming would never even be realized due to a warming lag and methane degradation. 960 PPM CO2e.  


However, as I keep saying in all my comments, because it is very relevant: Methane never even reaches it's full potential. This is due to methane degrading, and a few other negative feedbacks which means the full potential of such a release is never actually met.   


Basically, if such a large blowout were to occur it would be extremely disruptive and catastrophic for our current civilization. But it would most likely never even reach the maximum of 3.6C due to a short half life and a certain warming ""lag"". All this accumulates to one fact; The full warming potential is never reached, and the fact that methane degrades in only a few decades. If this were to happen, I'd have to guess we'd have several rough decades ahead of us. Agriculture would have a very hard time, while many areas would suffer more extreme weather events. Humans wouldn't go extinct, but our current society would have a hard time coping with such a large and abrupt event.","2019-06-10 12:01:38","1","[deleted]","1747904186.2337375","global temperature rise","manual"

When taking focused data like this, your ability to draw wider conclusions is hampered. One reason this is less interesting is that the temperature moderating effects of ice melt/freeze can in part explain this relatively constant temperature. Now when we expand our information gathering to include the increasing loss of ice from year to year, this becomes more informative. One could expect to see a much increased temperature difference over time upon reaching a state of little to no yearly ice remaining.","2019-06-15 13:56:21","4","Master_Ryan_Rahl","1747904217.1838784","global temperature rise","manual"

When you think of global temperatures you must think of the temperatures in the same way you think as the temperature of the human body.

1C is a slight fever. Have it for long enough and it will kill ya. That's where we are today.

 2C is a serious, debilitating fever. You can't survive it for long, and your body won't work correctly. This is when civilization stops working.

3C will kill you in a matter of days if not treated. The body seizes, the mind becomes delirious. 3C is not survivable for 95% of humans.","2019-06-20 11:13:33","2","Archimid","1747904334.6924605","global temperature rise","manual"

We’re facilitating, for example, the NaturALL Bottle Alliance, in which Danone, Nestlé and Pepsi are working with Origin Materials for the development of a bio-based PET bottle. We have also some examples of working with brand owners and people developing new recycling technologies. On the technical side, we conduct life cycle assessments of these innovative technologies.","2019-06-03 16:31:08","2","malaria1984","1747904843.6530554","global temperature rise","manual"
