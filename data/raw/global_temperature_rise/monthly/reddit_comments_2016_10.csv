But that is not what you see in your local weather or climate. You see dryer, wetter, hotter and colder seasons, you could get a record cold winter even when the global average temperature kept rising. But in the end, what happens at global levels affect local ones.

A good way to visualize how global and local relates and how they had been evolving with time are the graphs in I.e. http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/","2016-10-06 14:38:28","3","gmuslera","1747869435.4584064","global temperature rise","manual"
"d8ga7nk","t3_564q7i","564q7i","climatechange","action-oriented","Good questions - all with easily obtainable answers.  The change in temperature of the globe is not universal, some areas warm faster than others.  For example, the Northern hemisphere has warmed a LOT more than the Southern hemisphere.  The Arctic and near Arctic have warmed greatly while the Antarctic has large areas that are actually cooling over time.

In general, the theory states that the poles will warm faster than the equator, and the larger the latitude, the more warming one would see.  It's also true that a small amount of warming during the winter near the Arctic has a stronger effect than the same amount of warming during the summer would, or at the equator at any time.  This is because of the way matter radiates - the power transferred via radiation is calculated by multiplying the matter times an emissivity factor based on what matter it is, times the 4th power of the temperature in Kelvin.  The higher the temperature, the more energy it radiates away, and that number climbs rapidly since it is exponential in nature.

When you look at graphs of temperature change, you might notice that the top of the world looks like it's the place where all of the warming is happening.  If the higher parts of the Northern Hemisphere, between 33% and 40% of the planet, are seeing temperature changes of 4º, what's left for the other 60% of the planet if the *average* temperature rise is only 1º?","2016-10-06 11:11:17","3","deck_hand","1747869435.4624069","global temperature rise","manual"
"d8gj8tl","t3_564q7i","564q7i","climatechange","action-oriented","Looking back at ice cores over hundred's of thousands of years it has been common for one pole to cool during periods where the other warms up. I have seen it speculated that this is perhaps due to changes in the ocean conveyor belt (as it sounds, how hot and cold water is moved around the Earth's oceans) during periods of climatic change. 

(I say periods of climatic change, rather than 'climate change' to draw distinction between processes occurring at these time v. what is happening now - those earlier climatic changes apparently are a result of tilts in the Earth's access inducing colder/warmer periods, rather than the huge introduction of greenhouse gases as is happening now.

Edit - No surprise the Earth is an incredible dynamic system. Climate change is as straightforward as high school physics, but exactly how every impact might play out (particularly with regard to timeframes) is difficult to predict. One important factor to note is that because the ocean requires a lot more energy to heat up than land, and given that more of the Earth is covered in ocean, an average two degree rise means more than a two degree rise on land. Also, extreme weather events on land (such as heatwaves) will be significantly hotter than we have experienced previously. Hopefully infrastructure is robust enough to deal with these extremes. In the UK the wrong type of leaves on the line can shut the trains down, so god knows what they will do with buckling tracks with 8 - 10deg c higher than previous heatwaves...!","2016-10-06 15:28:55","3","r2w9ea8ufp84","1747869435.466406","global temperature rise","manual"

"d8hrks6","t3_564q7i","564q7i","climatechange","action-oriented","The pattern of warming across the globe is not homogeneous, nor is is it expected to be, but that has much more to do with fundamentals of widescale ocean/atmosphere heat transfer and feedback mechanisms than where emissions are happening.

On very local scales, urban environments for example, low-level emissions of particulate matter and Ozone-producing substances can have substantial effects, as can changes like building on previously green areas. However, these are largely separate issues from what's been talked about when referencing 'global warming' or 'climate change' because they affect a very small fraction of the Earth's surface.","2016-10-07 12:18:38","2","skeeezoid","1747869435.4704182","global temperature rise","manual"
