"6sbwte","climatechange","action-oriented","A question about nuclear winter, heat trapping, and wildfires","So I came across the idea of increasing wildfires, caused by rising temperatures, futher increasing global warming because it releases carbon into the atmosphere.

My question has to do with the concept of a nuclear winter. In this scenario, huge volcanic eruptions, astroid impact or nuclear war would send so much ash and other particles into the atmosphere that the suns rays would not penetrate to the surface. The earth would cool rapidly as a result and much of the life on the planet would freeze to death.

Could somebody on this sub explain to me the difference between these scenarios? As in, why do some kinds of particles trap heat on earth and others reflect the suns rays away from the planet?","2017-08-08 07:19:43","4","1","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/6sbwte/a_question_about_nuclear_winter_heat_trapping_and/","True","Optimouse","1747879274.9936132","global temperature rise","manual"
