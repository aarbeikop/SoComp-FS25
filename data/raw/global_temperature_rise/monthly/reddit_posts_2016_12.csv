"5hayuj","climate","scientific","Help me understand climate change as more than global warming","tl;dr recommend me a book

So 2^o C warming naively doesn't sound like a whole lot but the  effects are enormous. I would like to go from just thinking about climate change as this one number, global warming, to a more detailed picture. I want to better understand how such a small shift in average temperatures can have such large effects on hurricanes, ecosystems, droughts, and so on. Basically, what makes climate so sensitive. Part of it is of course that an average is an *average* so it doesn't capture spatial and temporal variations, [as explained here](https://www.quora.com/If-global-warming-can-cause-just-a-couple-degrees-Celsius-of-temperature-rise-and-just-a-few-meters-of-sea-level-rise-then-apart-from-a-few-low-altitude-places-slowly-going-under-water-why-is-it-such-a-big-deal/answer/Matthew-Kuzma). But then I become curious as to how these variations in space and time arise, so I need to understand climate science better...

A real answer, I guess, is probably book-length. I've got a library card so don't hesitate to just recommend a book.","2016-12-09 01:27:29","10","15","0.87","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/5hayuj/help_me_understand_climate_change_as_more_than/","True","PatrickBaitman","1747871702.1212363","global temperature rise","manual"
"5hlpr6","climate","scientific","The logical steps of climate change","There are two ideas:

(1) C02 is increasing.

(2) The global temperature is increasing


I am looking for the specific mechanism (most likely an equation / theories of physics) which climate scientists use to connect (1) and (2) together, and infer that (1) causes (2).

I am looking for the math / science that explains how a rise in C02 can cause a rise in global temperature.

I wonder if you might be able to clearly explain this to me in quite basic terms, and direct me to a source that explains it in greater depth?

Thanks.","2016-12-10 19:09:13","1","4","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/5hlpr6/the_logical_steps_of_climate_change/","True","Simshazlowx","1747871734.1821985","global temperature rise","manual"
