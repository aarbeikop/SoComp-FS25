Firstly, are we talking about a huge change? What would be ""huge""?  We're talking about warming of about 3K for a doubling from 300ppm to 600ppm compared to a base temperature of 288K. That's a 1% increase. And the direct CO2 influence before feedbacks is actually 1K, so a 0.3% effect.

But that's actually not terribly relevant as it turns out. Greenhouse gases like CFC-12 have a current atmospheric concentration several orders of magnitude smaller than CO2 (500 parts per trillion vs. 400 parts per million) yet if the Montreal Protocol had not been implemented warming due to increasing CFC-12 and similar gases with even tinier concentrations might have been nearly as great as CO2. The CO2 effect is much weaker per molecule because a large fraction of the CO2 part of the absorption spectrum is already highly saturated, both due to existing CO2 and an overlap with water vapour. Whereas CFC-12 and similar absorb in a largely untouched part of the spectrum.

A lot of people seem to misunderstand the greenhouse effect as being about direct heating via atmospheric absorption, but that's not how it works. The way it works is by modifying the altitude of average IR emission to space in an atmosphere in which temperature declines with altitude. As you fill up the atmosphere with more CO2 the chance of a single photon making its way from the surface directly out to space unimpeded gets smaller. And indeed the chance of any photon making its way from any layer of the atmosphere out to space without being captured declines. Necessarily that means the average height of IR emission to space is elevated. Since temperature declines with altitude in the troposphere and the average height of IR emission (sometimes called the emission layer) is currently well within the troposphere this means the average temperature of total IR emission declines as CO2 increases. And since total energy emitted is proportional to the fourth power of temperature the amount of outgoing energy declines. This means there is less energy going out than coming in and the system warms.

In specifics a doubling of CO2 raises the average height of IR emission to space by about 100 metres. Given the standard atmospheric temperature ""lapse rate"" of 10K per km altitude, that means the emission layer is colder by 1K. The equilibrium emission layer temperature is 255K, governed by the solar input - albedo and the Stefan-Boltzmann law (255\^4 \* 0.0000000567 = 240W/m2; solar input 1360W/m2 \* 0.25 (sphere) \* 0.7 albedo = \~240W/m2). Reducing the emission layer temperature by 1K to 254K reduces outgoing energy to 236W/m2, a reduction of 4W/m2. This is the CO2 forcing.","2019-05-25 11:15:20","3","skeeezoid","1747903269.2258525","global temperature rise","manual"

You are trying to apply you intuitions developed to deal with objects you can touch and see to entities small enough to be influenced by de Broglie wavelengths and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. At sea level particles will experience 10 billion collisions a second. I have not worked out the density of 15 micrometer photons in the flux from a blackbody at 287K but it is plausible molecules may be absorbing and emitting photons millions of times a second. 

At 15 micrometers (roughly the peak blackbody wavelength of the Earths average surface temperature, 14C) , every time a molecule absorbs this photon it gains 0.0827 eV. It gains a significant amount of kinetic energy and has 10 billion collisions a second to pass that energy on. 

If you want to get gnarly with the process at first year type physics level, these are the numbers you have to start thinking about.","2019-05-25 19:32:29","1","[deleted]","1747903269.2258525","global temperature rise","manual"
"eozgfnf","t3_bsn2lt","bsn2lt","climatechange","action-oriented","At least one of the web pages you've read claims that CO2 ""traps"" heat. That is a misconception that emerged early on in the current ""crisis"" and which has stuck with us. Gases do not warm by exposure to IR radiation. Gases heat up only by mechanical transfer, meaning heat transfer by contact. CO2 could be doubled or tripled and it could not have any heat trapping effect, just as we could vary any other gas without effect. 

The IR spectrum of frequencies is 100um wide. CO2 is opaque to IR at only 3 peak frequencies, [2.7, 4.3, and 15um] (https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fslideplayer.com%2Fslide%2F4178834%2F14%2Fimages%2F42%2FIR%2BAbsorption%2BSpectrum%2Bof%2BCO2.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fslideplayer.com%2Fslide%2F4178834%2F&docid=YKpcdLD7GmOXRM&tbnid=iDkbtJGKX4lcjM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwiU3aulzdTgAhUIslQKHVF1BkEQMwhQKAUwBQ..i&w=960&h=720&client=firefox-b&bih=622&biw=1024&q=co2%20ir%20absorption%20spectrum&ved=0ahUKEwiU3aulzdTgAhUIslQKHVF1BkEQMwhQKAUwBQ&iact=mrc&uact=8). All other IR passes through the molecule. Solid matter, like the ground of Earth is opaque to all IR frequencies, and like every molecule the ground radiates IR at frequencies limited by it's temperature. The concern of AGW proponents is that the extra CO2 will intercept the outgoing IR and re-radiate that back down thereby causing further heating. CO2 does not prevent heat from escaping, but according to the AGW model it slows down the eventual re-emission of IR to space. 

From the above we can score one point for AGW since we can't deny that effect. However, there is the matter of how much that extra warming means to the actual temperature change that has been observed. According to AGW theory, the tiny increase in radiated IR induced by CO2 acts as a forcing on water vapour (WV). WV is opaque to huge range of IR and is by far the only GHG that has ever made a difference in temperature. You may have read that without WV Earth would be a snowball. 
As I said, CO2 opacity peaks at 15um, but the curve of the absorption band includes weak opacity at 12 um. (weak means that most of the 12um IR passes through and only a few photons are absorbed) WV overlaps CO2 at that 12um frequency and that is what all the fuss is about - one weak frequency out of a band 100um wide. 

WV has the ability to ""trap"" heat only due to the high heat capacity of the H2O molecule in it’s liquid form. Water does not heat up or cool down quickly and it makes up 2/3 of the surface of the planet. That makes water in all it's forms the modulator of climate, not CO2. It's been estimated that global humidity should rise ~4% for each 1C rise in temperature, which is exactly what we're seeing now.","2019-05-27 12:37:28","1","there_ARE_watches","1747903269.2323744","global temperature rise","manual"
"eop21xb","t3_bsn2lt","bsn2lt","climatechange","action-oriented"," Most people incorrectly think that Co2 is absorbing more heat, when in reality it is actually the high altitude cooling effect that causes the lower atmospheric heating.

Co2 causes the upper atmosphere to cool slightly(because it absorbs and re-emits IR), which slightly contracts the atmosphere, which reduces the surface area of the surface of last scattering. When you reduce the surface area, but keep the heating constant, it warms.

The surface of last scattering is the point where the air becomes thin enough that IR can actually travel straight to space. This happens at 6-8km(depends on local conditions), below about 6km, IR(~5nm and ~15nm) is 100% opaque within a short distance.","2019-05-25 02:56:53","0","FireFoxG","1747903269.2323744","global temperature rise","manual"

  I think so I'm a little lazy, and only found something that's ""kind of"" related, but it's pretty good. it's from our national lab (NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology - the only National lab specifically required by our US Constitution!  I linked their pulicatoin page at the bottom, spend some time and I'll bet you'll find exactly what you're looking for)

>  Abstract
> The IR spectra of water vapor–carbon dioxide mixtures as well as the spectra of pure gas samples have been recorded using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer at a resolution of 0.1 cm−1 in order to explore the effect of colliding CO2 and H2O molecules on their continuum absorptions. The sample temperatures were 294, 311, 325 and 339 K. Measurements have been conducted at several different water vapor partial pressures depending on the cell temperature. Carbon dioxide pressures were kept close to the three values of 103, 207 and 311 kPa (1.02, 2.04 and 3.07 atm). The path length used in the study was 100 m. It was established that, in the region around 1100 cm−1, the continuum absorption coefficient CH2O+CO2 is about 20 times stronger than the water–nitrogen continuum absorption coefficient CH2O+N2. On the other hand, in the far wing region (2500 cm−1) of the ν3 CO2 fundamental band, the binary absorption coefficient CCO2+H2O appears to be about one order of magnitude stronger than the absorption coefficient CCO2+CO2 in pure carbon dioxide. The continuum interpretation and the main problem of molecular band shape formation are discussed in light of these experimental facts.
