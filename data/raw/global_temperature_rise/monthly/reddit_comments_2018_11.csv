Because so much CO2 has been emitted the planet's temperature is rising and changing the climate (rising sea level, flooding,  heat waves, more hurricanes, glacier melting, more droughts, wild fires, dead animals, dead insects, fish, people, etc.).

We have little time to fix the problem and it is not easy. This is the biggest disaster in mankind's history.","2018-11-08 05:07:55","7","[deleted]","1747893289.9956925","global temperature rise","manual"

But since 150 years ago, we began overusing petrol etc, so all that exhaust is making air hotter. That means, ice is melting and many types of animals and plants are dying. Which means we are fucked. Because all natural cycles get disturbed if the animals and plants in them are gone. 

So we need to help as much to reduce and slow down and hopefully reverse the damage.","2018-11-08 08:37:04","6","VimaKadphises","1747893289.9976926","global temperature rise","manual"
"e9afplj","t3_9v6ep7","9v6ep7","climatechange","action-oriented","Here's why the temperature rise is so serious: not because warmth is necessarily a bad thing, but rather because the speed of the rise is so quick.  Different species of trees rely on certain bands of temperature and moisture. For example, Oak forests like one type of climate, pines another. If the temperature and moisture band they like moves 300 miles north over 20 years, they can't just pick up and move north. Instead, they die off. And all the animals, birds, and other things that rely on them are going to be displaced too. This displacement effect is going to impact tonsof different habitats -- everything from rainforests to mangrove swamps to boreal firests. And if the changes keep happening, if the target zone keeps moving, the habitats will not have a chance to re-establish themselves.

So, It's not just a rapid disruption, it's an ongoing one. And it's affecting every kind of natural habitat, and every kind of natural community, you can think of.

We all rely on those natural communities to be healthy.  And they are all under attack.

If the rate of rise was slower -- say, 1 degree over 100 years -- the natural world could adapt. But right now it's much faster than that.

That is why slowing the rate of rise is so important. But it's an opportunity, too. We may not be able to prevent the rise from happening; but we can slow it, perhaps enough that the planet's natural communities can adapt.","2018-11-08 13:28:46","5","[deleted]","1747893290.0006921","global temperature rise","manual"
"e9aevkk","t3_9v6ep7","9v6ep7","climatechange","action-oriented","It’s helpful to understand the carbon cycle. Basically, carbon dioxide in the air is turned into oxygen by plants and the sun (photosynthesis). You’ll notice that Oxygen has no carbon, so where does it go? It’s stored in the plants, trees, etc. When these plants die, they either burn or decompose and release it back into the air. Thus, a cycle. Since plants and trees naturally grow and die, the carbon cycle roughly balances out over many years—maybe a few decades, but certainly centuries. 

However, if a plant or tree is in a swamp or bog, it’s possible for the plant or tree to fossilize before it decomposes or burns. The carbon is thus trapped. This happens to a small % of plants each year, and is relatively negligible if you look at it on a year by year basis, or even a century by century. Do this for millions of years, however, and suddenly you have a lot of carbon under the surface that has been removed .01% at a time, but over time adds up to way more carbon than is usually in the atmosphere. 

Humanity discovered that carbon in the form of oil, natural gas, and coal. So carbon that was pulled out a tiny bit at a time is being released in torrents. Thus, climate change. ","2018-11-08 13:13:12","2","paulloewen","1747893290.0039525","global temperature rise","manual"

The problem is that we've been adding an excess of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth's temperature is rising very quickly (\~1.5°C / century). This is about an order of magnitude faster than, say, the rate of change between the last glacial maximum (an ""ice age"") and the current warm period. If that rate were to continue as is, and even if it slows down a bit, Earth will be uninhabitable within a few centuries. Official projections are even more dire than what I just described.

Although that is overwhelmingly supported by science - and you can go on to point out that oceans are 30% more acidic than pre industrial levels and that the lowering of pH affects calcium-carbonate bonding of wildlife - make climate change a whole lot realer for them.
Climate change is everything humans are doing - pouring plastic into the oceans, carving up the natural landscape into isolated pockets by cities and highways, by hunting/killing/moving/rearranging wildlife, over-fishing, by mining into the earth - *everything* we're doing is negatively impacting the environment. The tonnes of plastic in the ocean aren't abstract scientific arguments that can be denied.

Still, this friend's ""places are colder"" argument is unscientific - ask for sources, and point out the short term *weather* is not the same as global, long term *climate* trends. A cold day or week in the Iraqi summer doesn't mean it's not happening.

Lastly, this friend's argument suggests that climate change is still a ""maybe/maybe not argument"". Stress that it is happening *now*. Coastal areas in Pakistan are seeing major change in water they live near, places like Uganda and Kenya are seeing major crop failures. It's so obstinate to believe this is still some far off thing to recreation-ally argue about - people are getting hurt now.","2018-11-29 00:54:35","1","[deleted]","1747893317.9944706","global temperature rise","manual"

Climate change doesn't have to be entirely mankind's fault, remember that this earth is starting to age and could become tossed out like an old used rag once it's resources are used or even misused. Which would be partly mankind's fault!!

The times, they are a changing - 

climate scientists call it climate change and credit mankind & the misuse of resources for causing it.

Even the Bible says that the earth will experience volatile times.

God's word says -

""The earth is broken asunder, The earth is split through, The earth is shaken violently. The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard, And it totters like a shack, For its transgression is heavy upon it, And it will fall, never to rise again.""  Isaiah 24:19-20

This is the judgement given because of mankind's rejection of God and misuse of His creation.

I believe that greater uncontrollable forces are at work here and the earth's tilt even slightly off can cause drastic change in the climate of seasons and effects on earth.

In Australia we are experiencing extremes like never before. Wildfires in the north and flooding in the south and further south snow when we are days away from summer season and epic dust storms from extreme drought the likes Australia hasn't seen at least in the las 100-200  years.","2018-11-28 22:41:44","0","ace_supreme","1747893318.0009828","global temperature rise","manual"
