CO2 with absent C14 has been measured in concentrations way higher than expected. You can hit your dad with that, it's the most devastating argument that is undisputable in every way.

Everything else is disputable, unfortunately. There is plenty of hard evidence, but undisputable is a bold claim to make.","2019-03-15 23:01:12","1","FrankdeBoer","1747896852.099144","global temperature rise","manual"
"ei64t3y","t3_az25ki","az25ki","climate","scientific","They won't be able to go skiing. That's already happening. 

Ticks will migrate into and infest areas where they used to enjoy hiking. This is already happening.

Trees in their backyards and in the woods will die off at an increasing rate due to combined stresses from extreme weather and lethal insects/microbes that previously couldn't overwinter in their area. This is already happening.

Certain species in their gardens will die off for similar reasons to the trees. Other species won't bloom or fruit because the timing for insects pollinating them is thrown off by early springs/late frosts, etc. This is already happening.

Home foundations will increasingly be damaged by extreme weather. Over saturated soil that freezes and expands pushes foundations in, drought pulls the dry soil back from the foundations and they move outward. Cracks begin to form. Sometimes major ones. This is already happening.

These are things people will notice ""at home""-- unless it's pointed out to them, they won't associate it with climate change.

On a larger level, the issue won't be the warmth, so much as the destruction of the ecosystem. The globe is a finely tuned piece of machinery that took hundreds of millions of years to evolve its inter-related systems.

Here's one sequence for example:

In spring, plants will bloom at times they didn't used to, and insects will emerge earlier, so the birds that arrive to eat them won't have food. Because the birds aren't there to eat them, the insects will infest things at a larger rate than they used to, causing various plant species to be eaten at a higher rate. Some of those plants are also eaten by small mammals, but there will be fewer of them, so more of the small mammals will die off--just move that up the food chain, you see where it's headed. Meanwhile the plants that didn't get pollinated like they should won't fruit or set seed, so anything depending on that fruit or seed is also out of luck and by the way, that plant won't reseed itself now.

The ecosystems have evolved based on set patterns of weather: rainy season, cold season, hot season, etc. When the weather becomes so erratic that people say ""there is no normal for this time of year anymore,"" it means every living species on the food chain is going to be stressed. Where do you farm if you can't predict the frost, rain and spring? Where do you raise livestock if you can't rely on the water supply and livable outdoor temperatures? How do you generate hydro electric power without the hydro part? What will people in the valleys of the world do for water when there is no spring runoff from snow melting on the mountains?

These problems are already occurring all over the world. Unfortunately, the media isn't reporting much of it if it doesn't happen ""here"" and they're not connecting the dots that they're all symptoms of the same disease.

Look up how many trees were killed in an unprecedented flood in Italy. Or how many cattle died in Australia's post-drought floods. Look up the ski resort in Chacaltaya, Bolivia and see how it's doing.

For all these ""isolated"" things, add ""coming soon to a community near you"" because they will. It's not a matter of ""if"" climate change will wreak havoc in your town. It will. You just don't know when.

Edit: Changed heatwave to post-drought flood. Got my eco-disasters mixed up.

Edit II: One thing I forgot, because it's tangential, but a BIG one to baby boomers. Tell them to ask their kids if they plan on having children of their own. Lots of millennials and GenZ are opting out because of climate change. If a boomer thinks they'll miss out on grandkids because of their inaction, they might sit up and take notice. I've seen a few people who thought it was all hyperbole till they realized ""no grandkids for YOU."" Changes their attitude instantly.

Edit III: (Last one, I promise.) If you're talking to business/finance oriented people, I just came across a great financial trend to cite (legit source NOAA, a government agency):

>In 2018, there were 14 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the United States. These events included 1 drought event, 8 severe storm events, 2 tropical cyclone events, 1 wildfire event, and 2 winter storm events. Overall, these events resulted in the deaths of 247 people and had significant economic effects on the areas impacted. The 1980–2018 annual average is 6.2 events (CPI-adjusted); the annual average for the most recent 5 years (2014–2018) is 12.6 events (CPI-adjusted). During 2018, the U.S. experienced an active year of billion-dollar disaster events including the 4th highest total number of events, only behind the years 2017, 2011 and 2016. In 2018, the U.S. also experienced the 4th highest total costs ($91 billion) only behind the years 2017, 2005 and 2012.

Weather events are the most obvious but many people deny the reality.

Ten years ago Syria grew its own food, especially wheat but then droughts sent farmers to the already overpacked cities. People grew restless and tried to overthrow the government which only resulted in a massive civil war. The war caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of people were forced to leave the country by sailing on the Mediterranean until they reached Europe. This destabilized several Eastern European governments, severely strained Germany and was a leading cause of the Brexit referendum. Echos of all this traveled across the Atlantic to the US abetted by Vladimir Putin.

"ehrjlg1","t3_awn3qg","awn3qg","climate","scientific","So I had to check up on that Arctic ice dropping from 7.9 to 4.6 million sq km. It seems this is the minimum value during the summer and during the winter the ice thickened to 14.5 million sq km in 2018 vs 17.5 million sq km in 1979. This certainly is still a decline but the record low seems to be in 2012 when it reached a min of 3.4 million sq km.  

If you look at older record it seems 1980 was a particularly thick ice cover, from 1975 to 1980 the ice got thicker despite increased CO2 emissions. It also appears that between 1935 and 1960 the ice was quite stable and got a lot thicker between 1965 and 1975, again despite increased CO2 emissions.
