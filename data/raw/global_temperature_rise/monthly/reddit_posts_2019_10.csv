The 800,000 year correlation between CO2 and global temperatures predicts that the 410 PPM CO2 already in the atmosphere will result in a huge spike 8°C of global warming. CO2 has spiked from 310 PPM to 410 PPM since 1950.

 A reply linked an article that shows temperature  changes are very typically followed by changes in CO2 levels with an 800 year delay.  [http://joannenova.com.au/global-warming-2/ice-core-graph/](http://joannenova.com.au/global-warming-2/ice-core-graph/) 

Another graph provided in this paper shows that the increases in global atmospheric CO2 precisely correspond to human CO2 emissions from 1900 to 2015. Both graphs have exactly the same curve over the same time frame. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336145637\_Proving\_the\_Reality\_of\_Global\_Warming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336145637_Proving_the_Reality_of_Global_Warming)

Since CO2 has spiked before a corresponding change in temperature and the emissions curve is identical to the atmospheric CO2 curve, this seems to be very compelling evidence that the CO2 spike must be caused by humans and not a natural phenomenon.

Current 410 PPM CO2 corresponds to 8°C (**see dashed line**)

“The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the global financial system is backing carbon-producing projects that will raise the temperature of the planet by over 4C – more than double the pledge to limit increases to well below 2C contained in the Paris Agreement.


World leaders agreed in the Paris climate accords to keep the temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C.

But in a stark illustration of the scale of the decarbonisation challenge facing the world economy, Carney suggested companies had already secured financing from investors in the global capital markets – worth $85tn (£67.2tn) for stocks and $100tn for bonds – that will keep the world on a trajectory consistent with catastrophic global heating.”

Haha yeah no shit. Anyone who thinks the (inadequate) Paris Agreement has any chance of being met is delusional. The system is in runaway feedback loop mode where money is God and fossil fuels are the drug. 

Gonna be interesting in 8 years time when the IPCC report is just one line “We’re fucked”.","2019-10-15 22:30:18","469","70","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/difo01/bank_of_england_boss_says_global_finance_is/","True","Littlearthquakes","1747908066.6537995","global temperature rise","manual"
"dpmwv2","sustainability","action-oriented","Can we talk about MrBeasts’ TeamTrees mission?","I’ve been seeing this cause spread all over the internet and tons of celebrities have been promoting it but I was wondering if anyone has actually done the research?

What are the logistics of this charity? How does my one dollar turn into a tree?

1) How are they being planted? 


2) How are they being guaranteed to turn into full grown trees? 


3) Where are they being planted? 


4) Do those areas even need new tree life or are they overcrowding woodlands?


5) If it’s just one dollar for one tree seed, then my one dollar should buy more than one seed. 

6) Where is the rest of that dollar going?


I don’t mean to be overly skeptical of something that is potentially very great but I want more information than I’ve been provided.","2019-10-31 12:36:39","25","15","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dpmwv2/can_we_talk_about_mrbeasts_teamtrees_mission/","True","eclaessy","1747908434.0272856","global temperature rise","manual"

Is there any evidence to the contrary?

This is in line with the net effects of every published paper, international conference, passionate speech, documentary and online comment on doing something about climate change.

Emissions are set to rise short term and long term.  The threat intensifies, the risk for everyone increases and the scale of the disaster expands.  Anything contrary to the immediate phase out of fossil fuels is unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.","2019-10-19 22:39:07","4","2","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dkaw0r/as_far_as_recent_climate_change_protests_have_gone/","True","--_-_o_-_--","1747908440.814826","global temperature rise","manual"
