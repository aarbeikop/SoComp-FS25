IPCC says the benefits of the warming will be positive until around 2C over pre-industrial times.

Given the newest estimates of TCR, It's likely that Global warming will be a net positive effect. Considering the TCR, we are not expected to use enough Fossil fuels to reach 2C because technological gains in non FF energy and dwindling FF supply.","2015-08-17 20:39:30","1","FireFoxG","1747856061.9198472","global temperature rise","manual"

Your understanding is wrong, you are confusing a number of completely different things and generally showing how you are completely ignorant in the subject. You also seem to have passed by fraud any course of physics you might claim in your past education since you seem to not understand relation between the caloric capacity of the ocean vs caloric capacity of bottom 2000m of the atmosphere vs  caloric capacity of the rest of the atmosphere.

"cu6djns","t3_3hcv8k","3hcv8k","climatechange","action-oriented","First, you're looking at decadal time scales rather than multi-decadal ones. Natural variation is so noisy on decadal time scales that it may seem as if it's not warming even though it really is if you take a step back to look at longer (and more statistically-significant) time periods.

Second, why only look at satellite records? The land-based datasets are just as useful and accurate, and perhaps even more so.

>Though the recent trans indo-pacific paper entails there is no heat below 700m, and likely lies within 100-300m of the ocean's surface.

Yeah, it appears most of the ""missing heat"" was indeed between 100m and 300m in the Pacific and Indian oceans.

> About 6% of the landmass on earth, but none the less one of the best built to purpose networks we have...shows no significant warming.`

You said it: they only represent 6% of the landmass, so you can't use them to argue that *global* temperatures have not gone up, especially when [these kinds of situations happen.](http://assets.decodedscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/201502.gif)

>So logically the heat (not in the atmosphere, likely not on the land, but in the ocean) should be causing expansion and thus increase SLA exponentially as heat continues to rise exponentially.

Where do you get that ""exponentially"" from? First, sea levels *are* increasing. Second, we're not expecitn ""exponential"" rise on decadal time scales.

I'm sorry, but it's painfully obvious you have no idea what you're talking about.

>Along with evidence that mankind has no affect on the sea level.

There is no such evidence.

>So no rising heat in the atmosphere,

There is rising heat in the atmosphere when you look at time scales that matter.

>no rising heat from the CRN.

Regional dataset.

>Most papers agree it's in the ocean, but the ocean doesn't appear to be responding.

Wrong. The ocean is showing a temperature increase and sea levels are rising.

>So either the heat is negligible, or the ocean is handling it. 

The heat is not negligible, but of course the thermal inertia of the oceans is much larger than the atmosphere's. However, as we can see from ocean-atmosphere heat exchanges, there is no guarantee that the heat will *stay* in the oceans. You might notice [we're heading into what appears to be a record-breaking El Nino...](http://robertscribbler.com/2015/07/27/possible-strongest-el-nino-on-record-gets-another-kick-from-upper-ocean-heat/)

>I also have studies indicating acidification isn't a concern

...and I have more that indicate it is.

>Ultimately there's no reasons we can't attempt to cut our emissions and work on viable renewable power sources.

Not only that, but we *should*, because our continued use of fossil fuels in indeed causing temperatures to rise, and according to the IPCC this could reach up to 5C by 2100.

>Though the heat either appears to be far less than what was predicted

It isn't, though it appears your limited understanding of the science is making you believe this.

>or is having a negligible affect.

There's no reason to believe that is the case, sorry.

"cu7vuu1","t3_3hcv8k","3hcv8k","climatechange","action-oriented","> Heat in water causes expansion

Depends on the temperature. Actually, water contracts as it heats up close to 0 deg C and expands as it cools down. Also as ice melts into the oceans it decreases salinity and density (what you called ""expansion""). And we ARE measuring sea level increases... Sigh. So much wrong in just 5 words.
