"f9qffmd","t3_e6fz60","e6fz60","climatechange","action-oriented",">My question is - assuming we get to a point where we are better at influencing the climate and we can actually control it, what should we do? Do we keep it at a steady temperature, forever, say the current one? Should we interfere if an ice age is coming and we can prevent it? Should we make it hotter if it means we can free up more habitable space than we lose and we needed such space?

This is an excellent question for 22nd-century science. But we can still speculate about some general issues now.

First, we can observe that the global warming of the industrial period is associated with huge civilization-level booms — in population and in living standards. So before we monkey around with the planetary thermostat, we need to decide what impact we want to have on those trends. 

Population-wise, the boom crested a few decades ago, and now we can foresee a time when the global population (outside Africa) ceases to grow at all. That's probably good news. Once the global population hits probably 10 or 11 billion, we probably don't have to worry about climate interventions having an adverse impact on population trends. 

Economic-growth-wise, the boom is ongoing. And we definitely don't want it to slow down for at least a few more decades yet, because billions of people are seeing their living standards rise from a struggling level to a more stable one. That process needs to continue for a while yet.

But at some point in the future, the global population will be reasonably stable, and maybe by then the majority of the global population will live in economically-stable, advanced-tech societies. At that point, we can probably afford to conduct some experiments with the climate and see what happens. 

It's probably important to note that global warming has likely conferred its greatest benefits on the temperate latitudes, which is also where today's wealthy industrialized countries are (which is probably not a coincidence). But the wealthy-and-industrialized club of tomorrow will include more tropical-latitude countries, and there the effects of global warming have been more mixed. So when those countries reach wealthy/industrialized status, I expect them to have more influence on choosing a future path for the climate to follow. Global cooling technologies might receive widespread support at that time. 

As for what climate conditions to aim for: I think (in the 22nd century) these will wind up being set regionally rather than globally. Having a range of climate conditions available on the globe sounds more workable than making everyone agree on a single set of conditions.

A range of global climate conditions centering on the current climate seems pretty likely to me, as long certain problems like sea-level rise and ecological collapse can be kept under control. Given a choice, I think people will opt for quite a lot of sunshine and warm temperatures. In my country, the regions which offer more sun and warmth grow more quickly than the others.","2019-12-05 15:37:28","2","DocHarford","1747909597.857028","global temperature rise","manual"

That's a question for when we actually reach that point and it's as much philosophical as it is practical. My personal preference would be to go for whatever outcomes allows most people to live valuable lives and it's unlikely that covering half of the world in 3 kilometer deep ice sheets would do that.

We're still nowhere close to that level of technology, though, so it's a bit of a moot point.","2019-12-05 12:04:07","1","[deleted]","1747909597.857028","global temperature rise","manual"
"fbzru0f","t3_ef13aa","ef13aa","climatechange","action-oriented","Sorry for the short response, but a typical type of study which examines what amount of warming is caused by anthropogenic vs natural forcing is a ""detection and attribution"" or ""fingerprint"" study. If you search on Google Scholar or Nature Climate Change you will find plenty to sift through.

[This chapter in the Climate Science Special Report](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://science2017.globalchange.gov/&ved=2ahUKEwjapoyHoNDmAhWAB50JHbv1A9wQFjABegQIBxAL&usg=AOvVaw1DyV1sKQ3lWnsmvphp88cW) does a good job summarizing how we come to the conclusions we do and the relevant uncertainties.

[This paper is an okay start](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI3900.1&ved=2ahUKEwiOk9zwodDmAhVWbc0KHcM0CD4QFjARegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw1FFHTxKvlBvdo6Ska9otBp&cshid=1577258568683), in the introduction they cite a number of studies, and two reviews of the literature.

[This is an example](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/1520-0442%282004%29017%3C3721%3ACONAAF%3E2.0.CO%3B2) of an attribution study which demonstrates that there was actually a net cooling caused by Natural and Other Anthropogenic forcings over the latter half of the 20th Century, despite the strong warming we observed, indicating that anthropogenic GHG emissions likely accounted for all of the warming observed over that time period. Which goes along with what you were saying.

I believe it's the IPCC's conclusion that it is *extremely likely* that more than half of all warming since 1951 can be attributed to anthropogenic sources.
