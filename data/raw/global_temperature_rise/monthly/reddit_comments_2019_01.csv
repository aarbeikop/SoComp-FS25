The models are doing well despite what anyone says: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/climate-model-projections-compared-to-observations/ And if the models were substantially different from observations in a way that was unexpected then there would need to be a rethinking of what we know about forcings. But whether humans are having an influence or not is beyond question at this point. The temperature rise we have experienced is probably higher than anything experienced in the holocene. [Here is a graph](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png) of temperatures from the last 12,000 years at a 20 year resolution. That graph is from [this paper by Marcott](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~mli/Economics%207004/Marcott_Global%20Temperature%20Reconstructed.pdf). Also note how the modern instrument records is a huge unnatural looking spike. If there were a huge spike like that anywhere in the proxy records we would be able to see it.

The first prediction of a large temperature rise due to carbon emissions was made in 1896 by [Svante Arrhenius](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_3.php), his rough calculation was high but it was very good considering the small amount of information he had. He correctly calculated the right order of magnitude of the change. And now we have instrumental observations that show temperatures have risen at a pace that still has no known precedence [ [In the past century alone, the temperature has climbed 0.7 degrees Celsius, roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page3.php) ] rise to a point that has not been seen in *at least* [2000 years](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott_PAGES2k.png). Could the early scientists have gotten lucky with their prediction? That they could predict a huge unprecedented temperature rise that has no known precedent of happening in many thousands of years and then for it to happen directly after making the prediction. You at least have to admit that the sharp temperature spike looks a lot like [this graph](https://climate.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/24_co2-graph-021116-768px.jpg).  

But you know it's not just the basic physics and the observation of correlation that is convincing, but most people don't seem to understand that there are physical fingerprints in the atmosphere that show us what is causing the warming. For instance did you know that while the troposphere is warming the stratosphere is actually cooling? This happens as a transient effect when a large amount of greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere this blocks infrared radiation from reaching into the stratosphere, and so it cools. This effect has been observed and any other known source of temperature change would not have this result. If the Sun were the cause then all layers of the atmosphere would warm.

And it's not just that the stratosphere is cooling but also the diurnal temperature range (daily macimum and minimum temperature difference) is decreasing and the tropopause height is increasing. These observable effects are what go into fingerprint attribution studies. They can not be explained without a large greenhouse gas effect. Looking at these effects is just one method of attribution as well, there are many papers using different methods that come to a similar conclusion that humans are the cause.

The best way to find the truth is to genuinely argue from both side. Become aware of the pitfalls and strengths of each side of an argument. The more educated you are, the more likely your chance to find the truth.

My advice, tell your dad you believe in the science of climate change but you want to understand why he doesn’t. Ask your dad if he is willing to do research on both sides of the debate. You do the same. I guarantee you will both learn something new.

The best you can say is that there are other data and other models which can support a different interpretation. It's up to you whether you feel analytically grounded enough to enter a battle of models and interpretations.

This is the problem with trying to reduce extremely complex systems to models: There will always be wide ranges of models, methods, relevant datasets and interpretations. 

One method which I prefer as a starting point is to set models aside for a moment, and focus instead on empirical data: These data incontrovertibly show increases in terrestrial heat-energy reservoirs, prominently including the surface and troposphere, at around the same time that we've seen massive increases in the greenhouse-gas content of the atmosphere. 

That's proof of correlation, not proof of causation, so it's important not to overstate the value of this evidence. But the correlation, taken together with other empirical data if you wish, do strongly support a hypothesis of continued warming. 

That's a really good place to start. From there you can try to bring in models to attribute some percentage of warming to manmade GHG emissions — but at that point you're not really convincing anyone, you're just supporting your empirical point with added speculation. 

Adding speculation and model interpretations to empirical data is a fine enough analytic method on its own — it's how science goes forward. But it's not strong enough evidence to rule out other people's interpretations which start from approximately the same empirical data. We don't yet have climate-science methods that allow us to zero in on one model or one interpretation as the correct one. We have to remain open to everything that remains plausible but unproved...until it's actually disproven.

Your friend talks about emissions being above Scenario B, but that is only looking at CO2, while there are other GHG that affect the climate. Methane in particular is faster acting than CO2, so where did CH4 track? [RealClimate](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2018/06/30-years-after-hansens-testimony/) have looked into this and say that the most other GHG emissions have been tracking at or below Scenario C, so the overall anthropogenic forcing has been somewhere between B and C. Taking that into account, Hansen 1988 does surprisingly well for such a simple climate model. Later models have generally done better. 

Finally, the ""settled science"" schtick. Conservation of energy is a cornerstone of physics, it's pretty much as ""settled"" as you get, and that's all global warming is. If you let less energy leave a system (by blocking LW radiation leaving), then it warms up. So that's ""settled"".

EDIT: More to their point we have simply learned more about climate sensitivity in that time. Hansens's value for climate sensitivity is higher than the average we think now. And the 80s were when the first serious models were being made, we shouldn't expect it to be perfect. Scientists have already looked at the early models critically and improved on them. They made the same observation that this person is making and moved forward and incorporated new better knowledge of the atmosphere, this person is 30 years behind the science.","2019-01-25 21:52:50","1","[deleted]","1747895126.0761607","global temperature rise","manual"
"ef8mhjv","t3_ajs3vs","ajs3vs","climatechange","action-oriented","u/PSadair antropogenic climate change IS settled science, but that does not mean, that our models are already fully accurate. For instance solar output was strongest around year 1960 and is at an actual minimum (but the fall was not linear, of course). Also our aerosole output, mostly by SO2 emissions was cooling the planet, but in our efforts to reduce air pollution we cleaned up chimneys and so this cooling effect, ""solar dimming"" was reduced. There are losts of other effects. Let me give you a simple analogy: IF during winter you drive your car on a snowy slippery road and in a curve your car gets out of control, you are in deep trouble. However you might not be able to predict, if your journey will end at the next tree, or if you might get your car safely to a halt. Still this uncertainty does not mean the cause of your trouble, snow on the road and too high speed, is in any doubt.

"eeyckz7","t3_ajs3vs","ajs3vs","climatechange","action-oriented","This argument makes too many vague references to be effectively and specifically rebutted.

However, the fact that the earth is warming due to recent, human carbon dioxide emissions is settled science.

The exact temperature sensitivity of earth to carbon dioxide is far from settled, and we had very, very little idea of that sensitivity back in 1988. No shit that paper didn't spell out the earth's exact future!","2019-01-25 19:24:15","2","FIST_IT_AGAIN_TONY","1747895126.0861602","global temperature rise","manual"

could add this to to virus/bacteria bit i guess
