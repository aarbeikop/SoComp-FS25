One of the feedbacks in the climate system is that an increase in temperature leads to an increase in atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs. These, in turn, drive more warming, which drives more CO2, etc. They're not linear effects, so this isn't an argument for a runaway greenhouse effect - but what it tells you is that *either* a rise in CO2 *or* a rise in temperature can trigger a shift into a higher-temperature/higher CO2 regime. 

Higher temperatures can occur from variations in solar radiation (which aren't occurring now on timescales that matter) or variations in the earth's orbit (which also isn't happening in a way that matters). So yes, when there were no humans, there were other things that triggered the shift. This time it's not that. 

Big forest fires can cause lighting storms. Suppose we have data showing that when there's a big fire, it was followed by lightning. Is that evidence that lightning can't *cause* a fire? No, of course not; everyone knows that lightning can cause a forest fire. The fact that it's not always the cause doesn't mean that it's not ever the cause.

I don't think he's wrong that there are other contributors to climate, but the change is isolating this one sudden increase in CO2 while other factors remain within historical variances.

Over a long enough time, the other variations look like noise compared to the exponential increase in carbon. 

They're not passive players. They've always been forces, and are increasing now due to human activity. They're not mutually exclusive phenomena and part of the science separating out confounding variables. 

If a physicist looked at the inputs over a five year period maybe he'd come to this conclusion. Ask him to reexamine the longitudinal data over decades and centuries. 

One basic explanation...

Exposed to cosmic rays, manipulation of cloud formation will allow complete control of our berkelium supply. Control of North Atlantic deep-water formation and hence ENSO will allow domination of global natural essences, leading to final subjugation of physio-mental states and a hastening of the singularity. 


Anyone care to respond? If not, I'll assume my argument is unassailable.","2017-06-30 03:40:52","1","MFJohnTyndall","1747877358.1170611","global temperature rise","manual"
