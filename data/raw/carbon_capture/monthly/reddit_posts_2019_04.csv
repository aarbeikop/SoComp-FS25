"bha003","climatechange","action-oriented","Electric Arc carbon sequestration via renewable sorces? An interesting patent has expired.","I just learned that as of 04/25/2019 (yesterday) the pattent on a technology that uses electrical arc to bust apart CO2 back into O2, O3, and Carbon just became public domain. https://patents.google.com/patent/US3113086A/en

I imagine that this could be hooked up to wind turbines and other renewables to create carbon capture stations. I wonder how large something like this could be scaled up. Carbon separation from CO2 is much more effective under exposure to UV light so I'd be curious to know if the chamber which contains the  electrical arc could be exposed to sunlight somehow (bubble of transparent material that doesn't impede UV, possibly glass?) if carbon sequestration yield could be increased? (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/03/030320073502.htm)

The thing about electricity is that even after arcing, it still exists and needs to ground. In theory this system could simply be a relay on a path to utilization of the same electricity for consumer purposes. 

Wind turbine -> Battery-> Capacitor Array-> Carbon Sequestration Arcing Array-> Battery Array-> Consumer Usage

Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.

Will there be new targets set? What response will different nations have? Will this have any impact in the global denial of the impacts of climate change?
