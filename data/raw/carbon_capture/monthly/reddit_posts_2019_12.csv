MIT engineers made a cheaper and more efficient device to trap carbon dioxide

December 1, 2019

Capturing carbon dioxide from smokestacks, and even removing it directly from air, might be the only way to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change. Engineers at MIT have now created a device to trap carbon dioxide that is much less energy-intensive and costly than today’s technologies.

The device, reported in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, works a lot like a battery. It absorbs carbon dioxide from air passing over its electrodes. It could be made as small and large as needed, making it easy to use at different carbon dioxide emission sources.

And unlike today’s carbon-capture techniques, it works for a wide range of concentrations. So it could be used to scrub carbon dioxide from factory and power plant flue gases or even directly pull it from the atmosphere, where it’s present at much lower levels.

Existing methods to absorb carbon dioxide from flue gases typically use watery solutions of amine or solid sorbent materials. The solution has to be heated to release the carbon dioxide and reuse the amine. This takes a lot of energy. Plus, the technology does not work at the lower concentrations found in air. Companies such as Climeworks have developed commercial plants that use special filters to suck up carbon dioxide directly from air. But the filters also have to be heated for reuse.

The new MIT system uses only electricity, so it could be powered by renewables. The device contains two thin, flexible electrode sheets coated with two different chemical compounds. During charging, one of the compounds, called polyanthraquinone, reacts with carbon dioxide and integrates the gas into the electrode. Discharging releases the carbon dioxide and frees up the quinone for reuse.

The idea is to pass a stream of flue gas or air through the device during charging to scrub it of carbon dioxide from. Once the electrode is saturated, the device would be switched to discharge mode and the pure released carbon dioxide could be compressed for storage underground or for use to make fuels and other chemicals. Or two separate units could be operated in opposite modes to remove carbon dioxide continuously.

The system uses about one gigajoule of energy per ton of carbon dioxide captured. Other existing methods can use up to 10 times that much, according to Sahag Voskian, a chemical engineering postdoctoral researcher who developed the new technology. He added that the electrodes should cost tens of dollars per square meter to produce, and could easily be made in large quantities using roll-to-roll processing techniques.","2019-12-02 15:01:27","83","13","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e507sm/mit_engineers_made_a_cheaper_and_more_efficient/","True","Banana22467","1747915147.834524","carbon capture","manual"
"ehcms0","climatechange","action-oriented","Climate Change made easy 8)","The earth and humans are quite similar.

The earth is a fine tuned self regulating machine just like the human body.  Both of them can take a lot of abuse before getting sick.

The earth is getting sick here is why.

Us little humans critters, 7.5 billion of us and counting are crawling all over her.  She can handle that pretty well except the Co2 problem is making her sick.

The earth has a tremendous amount of stored energy coal, oil and natural gas in her belly.  Well us crafty humans critters figured out that if we drill and mine her belly we can use this stuff to power factories, cars, jets, homes etc, fantastic.

Well there is a problem, in all that coal, oil and gas is a blast from the past.  Forest, plants and animals that got buried and smashed for millions of years turns naturally into fossil stuff like lumps of coal and sticky oil.

But what people dont know is that when all the plants were alive they absorbed, grabbed, tackled, hugged and stored Co2 by the mega super load.

So when the little squeeky human critters figured out they could burn this and turn it into power they went happy crazy.

The problem is, when these fossil fuels are burnt the carbon atom pops out into the air like a wet soap bar out of ur hands in the shower.  It floats into the atmosphere and stays there for a long long time.  

You will here it explained like this, “there is umpteen giggly mega super metric tonnes of Carbon in the atmosphere”.  Us human critters minds and eyes glaze over, can’t comprehend it, me either.

So here is what happens.  The Co2 atoms are side by side and bend and lock arms to form a coat/blanket over the earth.  Like if we are to wear a clear plastic bag over us what happens. We get sticky and hot. The earth is the same. 

When the sun rays hit the earth a lot ricochets right back up to outter space especially off of clouds of frozen sea ice. But the Co2 is like a clear plastic bag over the earth that holds all that ricocheded sunlight energy in.   Like a green house does, that is where they coined the term “green house effect”.

That clear plastic bag of Co2 also has a double whammy effect.  Co2 is one of the only gasses that stores the suns energy.  It also holds more moisture.  This is bad because it means more bigger and badder storms/tornadoes etc.

So whats the big deal if the earth warms a little?  To us human critters playing outside not much.  To the Earth, it’s a big deal.

How do u feel when ur running a temperature but feel cold.   U feel whack a doodled and dont like it.  Or when you wake up sticky and hot and whip off the blankets, AAAHHH.  The earth can’t do that.

Before the earth was just spinning round enjoying the view, doing normal weather like when we were a kid.

Well the earth cant do that anymore cause she has the Co2 plastic bag wrapped around her.  And she is getting hotter and that pushes weather currents/jet streams etc around causing irregular weather.  Like today, Chicagoland weather is 60 degrees again.  The second time in late December, (warning sssshhh).

People wonder, well doesn’t the smart earth have some way to capture Co2 and cool itself?  She sure does but us little human critters is messing that up as well.  Its called trees and oceans.

The little human critters are burning down the rain forest that stood for millions of years, burning it down at record rates and smilin ear to ear.  That is a double whammy there.  Trees capture and store Co2 which are now gone.  And when trees are burnt it releases the giggly mega tonnes of Co2 in the atmosphere. 

Not to mention the smell of burnt fur from forest animals that can’t escape like the cute koala bears. They fall to the forest floor legs up and look like a toasted black chicken in your oven.

The oceans, are huge massive heat exchangers for the earth..... Buuuuut, u guessed it, Co2 is messing that up to.

Oceans are like humans and plants.  U probably heard that plants like and only live in a certain pH level.  pH is the certain level of acidic or alkaline that we need to live in.   In simple terms, it is the tasty zone that u like/need to live in.  If us human critters pH is out of whack in our bodies, we are a sick puppies.

Co2 is absorbed by the oceans in a natural process, but when it is force fed Co2 it changes the oceans very sensitive pH level. Which is killing coral reefs at an alarming rate.  Which causes species extinctions and disrupts the oceans entire food chain. Note, one billion people survive off of the ocean.

How much disruption is too much?  Time will tell, it’s like how many jenga blocks/species can be removed/extinct before it gets tipsy turvy and collapses???? WE, U, me, kids, gkids don’t want to find out.

I just scratched the tip of the melting ice berg, so to speak.  The world is so simple, but enormously complex, it is unreal.  And WE human critters have our heads shoulder deep in the sand.  For what?  Why can’t we take off our blinders and think ahead for our kids an gkids?

One thing for sure.  If we pull our heads out of the sand, shake like a dog and let the sand go flying.....

We can turn climate change around.  Like a lot of things, climate change is PREVENTABLE!","2019-12-29 22:28:43","0","10","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ehcms0/climate_change_made_easy_8/","True","walcron","1747915173.025711","carbon capture","manual"
"eey531","climatechange","action-oriented","Rainforest conservation, or, how to actually help?","I dumped the Christmas bonus into the Coalition of Rainforest Nations because it was presented as one of the most efficient charities re climate change but this morning I started wondering how.

When a tree grows and then rots it captures and then releases carbon. But since people have been burning fossils, we're out of sync and we need a way to capture from the atmosphere in a stronger way, such that it's a net negative. I'm all for rainforest conservation obv but it just can't be nearly enough to make a dent in this problem.

One of the most frustrating parts of this is that I can't figure out any ways to actually *help*. Our generation have grown up with ""the world is ending"" messages; both of the type where we had to work our asses off to fix things (year 2000 and 2038 computer bugs come to mind) and of the type that was clearly absolute bullshit (2012 ""Maya calendar"" garbage) and now here we have the big one. A problem that we've known about for decades.

I switched to vegan food in 1999 b/c climate change and when the 2006 IPCC report hit I stopped flying. I don't have any kids. Not sure how to effectively help. I'm broke and I don't have any skills.","2019-12-24 07:34:32","3","9","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/eey531/rainforest_conservation_or_how_to_actually_help/","True","Pink2DS","1747915175.3347251","carbon capture","manual"
"ehw27l","collapse","skeptical","The carbon problem is insurmountable. Let's have some fun with the math and do a sci-fi thought experiment to show how fucked we are!","The average American's carbon footprint per person in 2014 was 21.5 metric tons of CO2 according to the University of Michigan. Let's use these numbers along with some pretend technology and do a little thought experiment to visualize what we're up against. 

These emission numbers represent a whopping 47,400 lbs (21.500 kg) of carbon dioxide per person per year. That's about 130 lbs (59 kg) of carbon dioxide per day per person. Holy shit, right? A family of four is pumping out 520 lbs (240 kg) of CO2 per *day*. Day in and day out, year after year. That's almost their entire body mass per day emitted as CO2. (Let's be realistic though... The average American is way heavier than 130 lbs.)

Let's set a lofty, albeit ultimately necessary goal and see what we're facing. We not only need to curb carbon emissions (which is not only *not* happening, but emissions are accelerating as I think most of us here know), but we also need to pull that carbon out of the atmosphere to even begin to attempt to undo climate change. Literally, let's imagine pulling some carbon out of the air! 

To that end, imagine a theoretical device that runs entirely on non-carbon emitting energy sources, draws in CO2 from the atmosphere, and outputs pure oxygen and carbon. Let's also say the carbon comes out in pure graphite form. 

In order to return the atmosphere to pre-industrial times, we'd need to be zero carbon emissions while our mythical machine produces 35 lbs of graphite per day per person. (That number accounts for elemental carbon only making up 27% of the mass of the CO2 molecule.) And that's just for Americans. Our average family of four would need to draw a 140 lb (63 kg) brick of graphite from the atmosphere per day. At 0.641 g/cm3 for graphite, that's about a **154  gallon (583 liter) block of graphite every week.** And that fucker would weigh over a thousand pounds. It's laborious enough to collect garbage... Imagine what it would take to haul away 1,000+ pounds (450+ kg) of graphite a week for every average household in America! And that's week after week, year after year, for all the time it takes to repair the atmosphere... It's beyond absurd. But that's what it would take, or something equivalent. It's not likely possible, practical, or feasible, even scaled up. 

The problem we're facing is comical in its proportions. I thought it would be fun to imagine this all from a literal carbon perspective and do the math. Please correct me on any calculations, I did it all very roughly!","2019-12-31 02:01:11","112","45","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ehw27l/the_carbon_problem_is_insurmountable_lets_have/","True","TheBroWhoLifts","1747915433.505337","carbon capture","manual"

Planetary C02 is going up [5,000,000 tons / hour](https://phys.org/news/2019-11-climate-comfort.html).

SUVs are solely responsible for [**50%**](https://www.wired.com/story/suvs-are-worse-for-the-climate-than-you-ever-imagined/) of human emissions rise in the last 10 years.

2010 = 35 million SUVs - 2020 = 200 million SUVs

There are 15 Major Tipping Points that really matter, 9 of which are triggered.

Tipping point [**interplay**](https://m.phys.org/news/2019-11-climate-scientists.html), is where each aggravates the other, leading to runaway hothouse mass extinction.

We are at  +1.1 °C now, we will pass 1.5 °C by 2040, 1.5 °C is likely locked in.

To avoid 1.5  °C, we must reduce emissions [**55% in 10 years**](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/new-un-climate-report-offers-bleak-emissions-forecast).

Try to remember the 55% number because you will likely never see it again.

If we don't do it, the world crashes, if we do the banks crash.

This cannot be done without civil wars and chaos.

The top 20 countries produce 80% of emissions.

Economic growth and energy growth have never diverged much more than 3% over 100 years.

The green new deal is complete, utter fucking bullshit, so are electric cars and wind/solar power.

Emissions rose 1.5% per year over 10 years.

They must go down 7% per year over the next 10 years. This is like negative compound interest rates.

When this damning report was released last week, [CNN and MSNBC ignored it](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/un-emissions-report-coverage-climate-change.php) for impeachment.

The people who ignore climate change the most watch FOX, CNN and MSNBC.

John Kerry et al have declared war on climate change, this is mostly a deep state psyop gaslighting effort.

Most people don't know that emission scenarios already include carbon sequestration.

There will be a concerted effort to pacify us with [carbon capture bullshit fantasy exercises](http://nautil.us/issue/78/atmospheres/is-net-zero-emissions-an-impossible-goal).

They say they can plant billions of tree seeds with planes, but it doesn't matter how many seeds you plant if [the world is on fire](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/29/countries-from-siberia-to-australia-are-burning-the-age-of-fire-is-the-bleakest-warning-yet).
