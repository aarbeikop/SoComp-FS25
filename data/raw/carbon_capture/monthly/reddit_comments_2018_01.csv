"dsd464v","t3_7oy2om","7oy2om","science","scientific","Extremely interesting topic.

To give us noobs an idea of the scale of the problem, let's say we want to capture the CO2 of a natural gas power plant (let's suppose a 500 electric MW one). How much land surface should we devote to greenhouses to capture most part of the output? If we feed directly the flue to the plants, what can we get? Just wood that we would then store somewhere to achieve carbon storage, or could we even feed the flue to some ""good"" crops (food plants, feed for livestock etc...). I'm thinking about pollution problems from other components of the flue gases on top of CO2","2018-01-08 13:13:33","1","lucaxx85","1747889784.304659","carbon capture","manual"

Can you run down for us how a typical setup would work/how much it would cost?","2018-01-08 15:38:53","1","lucaxx85","1747889784.306089","carbon capture","manual"

Side note: I did some googling and found out that you're the author of a novel?","2018-01-09 06:56:45","1","MichaelGuo88","1747889784.307277","carbon capture","manual"
