And start with learning about [Blue Carbon](https://www.conservation.org/projects/blue-carbon).  This is from [Blue Carbon Initiative](https://www.thebluecarboninitiative.org/):

* 83% of global carbon is circulated through the ocean
* Coastal habitats cover less than 2% of the total ocean area
* Costal habitats account for **\~ 50% of the total carbon sequestered in sediments.**

Specifically, the plants that do it:

1. [Mangrove Forests](https://blog.nature.org/science/2013/10/11/new-science-mangrove-forests-carbon-store-map/) are extremely good at capturing C02 .. many forests have been destroyed for access to beaches (much for tourism) – though efforts to reforest are under way –  [Conservation International](https://www.conservation.org/stories/critical-investment-in-blue-carbon) may have the largest program (and you can buy offsets to help this - that link mentions Apple, which has invested a decent amount) ..
2. [Seagrass](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/underwater-meadows-seagrass-could-be-ideal-carbon-sinks-180970686/) – also huge potential, but in decline because of human activity (not as much as mangroves)  ... can cover a greater area than mangroves, as it can grow in essentially in underwater meadows offshore.
3. Seaweed – also quite good at capture, also has other benefits like reduces local ocean acidification, removes nitrates and other nasties.Recent study said:

>Farming seaweed in just 3.8 percent of the federal waters off the California coast—that’s 0.065 percent of the global ocean suitable for growing macroalgae—could neutralize emissions from the state’s [$50 billion agriculture industry](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/), according to the paper published Thursday in the journal *Current Biology*.

From what I know the jury is still out on whether the sequestration is 'permanent' – another benefit of seaweed is that it [has a myriad of other uses](http://www.seaweed.ie/uses_general/). It can even be a [biofuel](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/08/22/542903378/scientists-hope-to-farm-the-biofuel-of-the-future-in-the-pacific-ocean), but that then becomes carbon neutral.

Sea plants take up 4x more co2 than land ones. I mean seems like a no brainer, but there are lobbying groups that’s work to prevent otters from being on certain parts of the coast because of fish farming. Particularly the albacore lobby group out of Monterey I have hear does a lot of work to keep otters out of the bay. But that’s cause they make a lot of money selling albacore to Asia, so gotta find new options for them possibly. Also crab fishers might get some of their product eaten... so there are a lot of things that need to be ironed out.

So a thoughtful engineer approached the re-insurance industry; the insurers of the insurers, the underwriters, and proposed what became Underwriters Laboratories. The new firm safety-tested appliances, certified safe ones and allowed these to use the UL logo. Underwriter customers; property insurance companies, only insured customers who themselves only used UL-listed goods, and customers sought out the new UL logo on appliances. and the world became safe for the electric industries, and for property insurers, and incidentally for the USA appliance-using public.

Now we face another industrial market failure; greenhouse gas emissions, and governments aren't solving this. 

Perhaps you can see where I'm going with this: maybe UL could certify 'Climate Safe' goods, services and programs, and give each a letter grade as well, stamped with the logo on the packaging. Insurance companies could chose to only cover losses from those using 'Climate Safe' things with a passing grade. Customers could favor 'Climate Safe' stuff with better grades. To inspire the laggards, most improved awards and ratings could reward improvement from any climate quality level.

My sense is that there is a lot of uncertainty and so a lot of disagreement about technical feasibility, but that the media and (environmentalist) politicians tend to gravitate toward the most optimistic assessments (Jacobson, etc.) despite the fact that these assessments receive a lot of legitimate criticism (ex. the Clack paper,  [https://www.qualenergia.it/sites/default/files/articolo-doc/wcc324-1.pdf](https://www.qualenergia.it/sites/default/files/articolo-doc/wcc324-1.pdf)).  

Do those in the field of renewable energy generally feel optimistic about the potential for a techno-modernist future or is there some undercurrent of disillusionment?  Do people in the field feel a lot of pressure to deliver on behalf of society since so much depends on advances in renewables? Or is it the case that the general feeling in the field that the bottleneck to a renewable future is purely political and that with adequate funding anything is possible?","2019-09-24 16:41:36","1","1HomoSapien","1747913496.261052","carbon capture","manual"

I don't know how much thinking has been done on the last two items except the spread of mosquitos, but consider how rapidly microbiotic environments are going to be evolving given the stress organisms are going to be under given the rapid changes of ecosystems. The interactions between organisms are also going to be wildly different as populations change and migrate, which suggests new disease vectors.

You don't mention greenland at all, which will be melting at an alarming rate, esp once a BOE event occurs. This will raise the oceans faster than Antarctica will at least until Antarctica starts to really melt... which is 2050+.

India will 100% run out of water around 2025. First nation to collapse.

Also the ocreans will be 150% more acidic by 2050. This kills a lot of ocean life. Certain species are having issues today because of it. 

Also based off the data it looks like a BOE will now occur between 2025 - 2029. once this ice is gone and is unable to cool the oceans, the artic oceans will absorb the sun and heat up 80x faster.

And as a side note, everyone is worried about hard/mineral/energy resources. However i'd like to argue we will run out of food worldwide before we hit these resource limits. Aka by the time we are about to hit resource limits, we will have already lost 6.5 billion people (50% of our food will be destroyed by climate change), thus those resources will now last much longer with only a billion people on earth left. the only places left to live will be near the poles/west Antarctica. majority of all factories and enegry plants will be shutdown at this point and the aerosol dimming effect will vanish, giving us another +2c added on to our already +4c at 2050.

And war will definitely break out in Asia. I suspect will will be india and pakistan will go to war over water like you mentioned. I just think it will happen around 2030.
