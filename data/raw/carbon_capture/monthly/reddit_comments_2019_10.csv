So, assuming stuff grows back and everything is fine is NOT true during periods of great change.

This is what happened a few years back with massive fires in Los Alamos, NM.  The new biomass that grew back was trivial desert scrub, compared with the old biomass which was a really gorgeous pine forest. The area entered the new Epoch!  Yikes...

If my understanding is correct, a single forest fire of large scale will undo a year or several or many years of GHG progress in the clean power sector, clean buildings sector, clean transportation, etc...

Ozone production/use near the surface of the earth does not affect ozone levels in the stratophere, which is what we're concerned about when we talk about he ozone layer.

Ozone is produced in the stratophere when UV rays break apart oxygen molecules and the oxygen atoms (O) then combine with oxygen molecules (O2) to form ozone (O3). The problem is that we're producing and releasing into the atmosphere chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons) which are very good at breaking down ozone, and that's a bad thing.","2019-10-01 04:55:51","3","mrrp","1747914258.870141","carbon capture","manual"

This is easier said than done, since roughly 80% of our current primary energy comes from fossil fuels and much of the rest comes from burning something (bioenergy).

In addition to that the LULUCF sector (land use, land use change and forestry) causes a lot of GHG emissions.

In addition to that, global heating is turning natural GHG sinks (forests and other land areas, perhaps even seas) into GHG sources.

BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) is the most ""promising"" solution, but it requires large areas of our current agricultural land converted into bioenergy crops, in addition to figuring out where and how we'd store the huge amount captured carbon dioxide.
