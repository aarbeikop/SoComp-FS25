"coacy4","collapse","skeptical","“Now that I know about collapse, what should I do with my life?”","This is a common question on this sub and since it’s Friday, I’d like to give my take. 

In some ways, I believe collapse is actually a relief, in terms of this question, because it removes a LOT of options. If you were planning on 12 years of schooling and 100k of debt to eventually be a sports psychologist... maybe reevaluate.

In my opinion, all of us that are lucky enough to be alive right now have only one job: to make the world a better place. This is what we were born to do regardless of collapse but collapse makes our purpose more urgent and more obvious. 

I want to be crystal clear about one point: making the world better is NOT the same as ‘saving’ the world or making the world perfect.

And another key point that is so hidden to most of humanity: your existence is not inherently evil. Just by being alive you can actually IMPROVE things, not just mitigate the negatives.

There are many ways to make the world better. Obviously we need to reduce carbon useage and avoid buying useless plastic crap from China. But moving past that, what can we do to improve things?

Start a garden. Capture rain water, compost your food waste, build soil in your backyard or an abandoned lot, let the little critters and pests eat your plants if they want to. What you will get is real LIFE and diversity. You will get food that you can eat and just by eating it and touching it you will improve your microbiome which will make your brain work better and make you more resistant to depression and cancer.

You can walk around the forest and help things along. A dead branch in a tree isn’t doing much, break it off and put it on the ground. It will feed the fungi and other plants and build the soil so the berry bushes produce more and the raccoons produce more and MORE LIFE HAPPENS. 

See a mushroom? Your can collect spores and spread them around which will give the whole ecosystem more access to nutrients through the complex fungal network. 

See an invasive plant? Pull it up before it seeds and you can increase biodiversity.

See a creek that is cutting through the soil causing massive erosion? (This happens a lot when people drive a 4x4 through a meadow and compact the soil). Throw some logs or rocks in sections of the creek. This will make it meander, allow more water to soak into the meadow, creating forage for deer or elk which will attract predators, which will create carrion, which create a diversity of invertebrate life and improve the soil and vegetation and biodiversity.

There are so many other things like this that you  can learn about or invent. These are the things our hunter gatherer ancestors did for hundreds of thousands of years. Pruning, burning, tilling, spreading seeds. This is our purpose in life. Every species has a niche and this is ours. 

So what should one do with their life now that they know about collapse? I say be a farmer. Learn about permaculture. This is what we are going to have to do anyway so we might as well start now. Lucky for us, this is probably the most rewarding life one can lead and collapse is just forcing us all to do it.","2019-08-09 23:33:05","148","52","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/coacy4/now_that_i_know_about_collapse_what_should_i_do/","True","ogretronz","1747912320.513628","carbon capture","manual"
