"evqz0ds","t3_ceurev","ceurev","collapse","skeptical","We currently have technology to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere at the rate required to fix the main greenhouse gas problem in the atmosphere.

We can do this with factories and of course with trees.

The tech is there we just need to replace the deniers in government and media.

it won't get bad so fast that we won't have enough time to rapidly build the factories required to remove enough CO2 from the atmosphere.

The heat will linger, the big threats are mass migration mostly from lack of rainfall and heat, loss of crops, pandemic and flooding. of the worst of those I would guess pandemic might hold the most threat for rapid human deaths.

The question is how bad will the weather have to get for people to embrace the technology that's mostly already there.

Between renewables and direct CO2 removal it would seem like we have enough options to handle CO2. That doesn't mean the damage done will be completely mitigate it though and of course there are other pollutants besides CO2.

those are just the practical options, we can go off into wild tangents about very extreme options like biologically engineered carbon sinks and directly altering ocean chemistry and using high-altitude particulate to control solar insulation.

We shouldn't have to do those things, but at least some of them probably hold potential.

it's also worth noting that climate was always going to kill us and even if we fix it it's still going to want to kill us. 

the climate we have now is actually nowhere near the usual climate for Earth. Before we overheated the planet humans were on the course to go into another 80000 year cooling period which would have also devastated humanity. However it would have happened too much slower than man-made global warming.

the point is for humans to survive we were always going to have to learn how to control the environment and to do that we have to use technology since simply relying on biology doesn't make a lot of sense when we know the Earth's climate is naturally not very stable.

To those saying that technology got us here so it's not a good idea, you're completely ignoring the natural history of Earth's climate as being quite Unstable. **All human history happened in one warming. Within one ice age and ice ages are not common.**

even if there was no industrial Revolution in fossil fuel climate would still be changing because climate is currently in a 20000 year warming trend with 80000 year cooling trend which roughly creates are hundred thousand year cycle which is probably significantly driven by how first orbit is altered by the positions of the planets.

The planets really do line up and cause a slow-moving Doomsday, but at the same time they've kept Earth climate in this tectonic arrangement interestingly cyclical. the problem is for twenty thousand years of good weather we have to wait through 80000 years of bad.

Miami climate change does have one upside and that is that it's going to rapidly forces to learn how to control the atmosphere, which is something we were going to have to learn to do anyway. Though I will say we already learned how to do it since we're pretty darn good at adding CO2 to the planet.

if you would rather Earth just go through its natural cycle into 80000 years of cooling you do have to understand that the majority of humans would not survive and you would be doing it for no good reason since there is no set climate for Earth.

Even the natural climate cycle is significantly determined by the biological life on the planet, as humans are currently proving!","2019-08-01 22:42:15","1","[deleted]","1747912238.0213","carbon capture","manual"

"ewh6oye","t3_coacy4","coacy4","collapse","skeptical","Well let's see about that... 

- reducing carbon usage does not make the world better place, it merely mitigates a part of one specific negative. You said it's a different thing, so nope, doesn't count;

- avoid buying plastic crap does not anyhow make anything better, same thing as above;

- starting a garden, going permaculture, etc - only makes the world better a little tiny bit, and likely only temporarily. If one does it in any place which will end up desertified, for example - which is large portion of presently-inhabited areas, quite possibly including ""your"" one - then it's all for nothing in the end: the garden will wither and die, along with all the microbiota. Thus, this will work only if you know where to do it. Suggest digging into PDSI research and calculated PDSI changes in the future; 

- manually putting dead branches from the tree to the ground makes the world itty tiny bit worse actually: that branch will end up on the ground anyway, and until then - it's quite useful where it is because certain other (non-soil-based) kinds of life very much use it; but you just spend some calories to actually perform the act, and chances are most of those calories come from industrial agriculture with all its emissions and such;

- same for manually spreading wild mushroom's spores. Also, you possibly just killed few critters who'd need to feed on that part of that mushroom in order to survive and/or reproduce;

- pulling up invasive plants by hand - same as above, not worth the effort and potentially even disastrous, as chances are you can't predict if that specific species could actually become very base of any specific and much important section of a particular eco-system in the future. Invasive plants are by definition more viable ""here and now"" since they manage to thrive, so such chances are higher for them;

- throwing rocks and logs into a creek? Frankly, this starts to be funny. What makes you think they won't cause extra rotting, dicease spreading, even trauma for either other humans, animals, or both?

- being a farmer is impossible without at least simplest tools. If everyone's a farmer, who will be making them? It's also impossible to be a farmer without protection: roaming bandits will take harvests and stored supplies, and sooner or later kill you. If everyone's good-willed a farmer, who will protect it all? Being a farmer is also impossible if an epidemy comes in - like Black Death did - and kill you. Who will be monitoring the situation and putting required quarantine measures if everyone's a farmer? List goes on and on. Someone has to raise animals, someone has to make and repair houses, someone has to be busy getting all the needed matherials, someone has to be coordinating everyone's efforts, someone has to build and maintain water storage and distribution systems, etc etc. 

Bottom line? Don't aim personally for making the world better, the thing - world - is way too huge and complex to be able to judge what's better and what's not, in so many cases. Leave that to large, coordinated research efforts which - hopefully - will start to happen sometime in distant future. Instead, go the least-disturbing way of achieving one's goals, whatever specific goals they are. Find out how to make do with doing least alteration and least effort. Good both for you and for the environment, as less action brings less unintended consequences, many of which can be quite bad.","2019-08-10 01:09:05","-11","Fins_FinsT","1747912322.341943","carbon capture","manual"
