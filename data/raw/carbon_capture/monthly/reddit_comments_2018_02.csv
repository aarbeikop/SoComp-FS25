What's the easiest way we can do our bit? I get that not many people want to change or even deny the climate is changing at all, so what's the lowest effort thing we can all do as a society to have a big difference?","2018-02-19 12:08:37","5","[deleted]","1747890838.591509","carbon capture","manual"
"duhotfr","t3_7ym67z","7ym67z","science","scientific","Hi there, thanks for the AMA!

I'm an Environmental Science  student and incredibly concerned about the future. 

My question is: realistically, do you think it will be possible to meet our goals to decarbonise the global economy without addressing areas such as shipping and aviation (absent from Paris Agreement), livestock agriculture and continued economic growth? For example there's current talks of expanding Heathrow which clearly goes against our climate agreements. We currently have no means to decarbonise these industries on a large scale and yet the demand grows every year. Even if we can decarbonise energy, heat and motor transport how do we tackle the more 'wicked problems' of the global economy before the carbon budget is effectively used up?

Also if I'm allowed a second question, I recently listened to a talk by Kevin Anderson on academia and climate change. Do you think in some way academia perpetuates the high-carbon lifestyle? For example, flying internationally for meetings/conferences. 

Thanks!

"duhn1ty","t3_7ym67z","7ym67z","science","scientific","I acknowledge the role that individuals, private companies, and local governments can have on reducing emissions but there are some projects so overwhelmingly expensive and difficult that only national governments can undertake them (e.g. the development of the computer in the 40s). In terms of climate solutions, this might be basic research and development in photovoltaic, fusion, storage, or yet untested technologies. Private industry research and development can only go so far (in terms of risk and projects that won’t pay off for decades).

Do you thing solving the problem of climate change is possible without the continuous and emphatic support of national governments (esp. the U.S.)?

My question is regarding our realistic ability to avoid catastrophic climate change. Considering the recent releases concerning the inability of carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS, DAC, etc) to scale sufficiently, and the IPCC working group 3 models *all* depending on large scale deployment of BECCS - how can we mitigate severe consequences of climate change when we have already effectively eliminated the ""realistic"" pathways to decarbonisation as put forward by the IPCC?
