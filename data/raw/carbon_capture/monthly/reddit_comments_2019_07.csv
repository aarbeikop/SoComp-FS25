The single most important aspect to get across to him is that *regardless* of climate change, even if it was not part of the equation, if you do not have sustainable production and consumption of energy you have **unsustainable** energy. Meaning the train will keep going but we’re going to run out of track. Fossil fuels are a dead end, and we’re just full smog ahead into a brick wall. 

Oil is a finite resource; the fossil fuel wells will run dry. It is a binary choice our species must face and the laws of physics are clear: a) we transition to sustainable energy, b) complete collapse of society. Those are the only two options possible even if climate change did not exist. The only choice we are left to decide is how quickly we get to sustainable energy.","2019-07-14 00:01:36","15","urunclejack","1747910459.729086","carbon capture","manual"

#What Technologies can help prevent or mitigate collapse?

##Nuclear Fusion

This is our holy mary pass as far as I can tell.  There is no other power source that can provide a total replacement of fossil fuels.  Renewables like wind and solar are great, but they require rare minerals that are going to be in short supply in the coming decades for their construction or for power storage. [[1]](https://www.world-bureau.com/services.asp#)  Hydro-electric and Geothermal are great, but they only work in certain geographic locations.  Nuclear fission is great (and probably our second-best bet), but it relies on heavy radioactive components like uranium which must be stored for thousands of years.  We would need to construct approximately 10,000 nuclear reactors globally to replace fossil fuels used for electricity with nuclear.[[2]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2016/ph241/lsm1/)  That's 10,000 unique locations that need to be secured for millennia, and this is not even taking into account the fact that we will also run out of uranium before long.

So nuclear fusion is the answer.  How feasible is it?  Well, we have had limited success with fusion testing, but the science is vastly underfunded if we hope to have stable consistent energy that can be scaled globally.  MIT has what seems to be the most optimistic prediction saying we will have the first fusion reactor online in 15 years.[[3]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2019/01/14/is-fusion-power-within-our-grasp/#5a8f0dae9bb4)  Other predictions say closer to 2030-2050.  Remember, getting one plant online is only the first step.  It needs to be consistent and safe before it can be globally scaled.  We need to put a lot more investment into fusion to make it a reality that can replace fossil fuels.

##Carbon Capture

Carbon Capture amounts to a mechanical tree.  The idea is that we create super-efficient trees that can suck up tons of carbon more efficiently than a tree can.  These machines will either be implemented in the form of atmospheric capture or smokestack capture where they will suck carbon out of the air or the chimneys of power and manufacturing plants and convert it into usable (or storable) fuel.  [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage)

The ROI on Carbon Capture is not quite there yet, but it has potential.  Right now the best Carbon Capture technology can remove Carbon from the atmosphere at a rate of $100-200/ton, and if scaled appropriately can remove (optimistically) up to 3.8 million tons of CO2 annually.  Comparing that to trees where 1 acre of trees absorb only 2.5 tons of CO2 annually.  [[5]](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-co2-machine-could-transform-the-way-we-fight-climate-change/)

The problem with Carbon Capture is that there is little profit incentive at the present time to improve it.  Unless the fuel from Carbon Capture becomes more valuable/viable or governments start taking climate change more seriously, the investment will remain low, and technology will improve slowly.  It has potential, but it likely won't save us.

##Artificial Meat

Artificial Meat has made leaps and strides in recent years.  Companies like Beyond[[6]](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/bynd) and Impossible[[7]](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/impossible-foods-ipo-now-looks-inevitable-cm1149822) have been doing very well, pulling down huge VC funding, and scaling quickly.  I’ve had both, and while they are not quite hamburger replacements yet in taste, they are close.  A lot of people have been waiting for good artificial meat to push them into the vegetarian camp.  With these kinds of innovations, we are one step closer.[[8]](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger)

Right now Beyond Meat averages around $10/pound.  That is expensive compared to chicken at $3-7/pound and ground beef at $3-4 per pound.[[9]](https://www.barrons.com/articles/beyond-meat-price-comparison-51559339044)  However, this price has been falling, and if these companies continue to scale it wouldn't be surprising to see meat replacements become cheaper than their “real” counterparts within a decade.  [[10]](https://vegannews.co/vegan-company-beyond-meats-plans-to-lower-price-could-be-disastrous-for-meat-industry/)

The meat industry contributes a significant amount of CO2 to the atmosphere.  It takes a ton of water and feed to bring a cow to slaughter, and it would be great for the environment if the meat industry were torn down. [[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production) However, this will require government action which will be severely unpopular so it will remain unlikely for the foreseeable future.

##Electric Vehicles

Electric vehicles have been taking increased market share year over year since Tesla came on the scene. [[12]](https://evadoption.com/ev-market-share/) The Big 3 are all working on or have released electric skews in their current lines, as are most other global manufacturers.  Electric vehicles produce effectively zero emissions once they hit the road, and should last for well over half a million miles with basic maintenance work.[[13]](https://insideevs.com/news/339110/highest-mileage-tesla-now-has-over-420000-miles/)

Unfortunately, the viability of electric vehicles hinges on a few things.  

The first and most obvious thing is, “Where is the electricity coming from?”  In most cases, the answer is coal or natural gas.[[14]](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3)  This is not progress, it is just trading one fossil fuel for another.

The second concern is that, while EVs produce no emissions on the road, the manufacturing and delivery process still relies heavily on fossil fuels.  It has been said that when a car hits the road, half of its lifetime emissions have already been created.[[15]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car)  This is especially an issue for EVs because they require a lot more rare minerals than traditional vehicles for batteries, technology, and electrical systems.

The third concern with EVs is the replacement rate.  Every year an automotive company produces gasoline-powered cars is putting at least a 10-year delay on the eventual replacement of said vehicle with its electric counterpart.  [[16]](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/average-vehicle-age-increase-america/)

The last and most pivotal impact on EV viability is price.  EVs are significantly more expensive than their traditional counterparts, and while arguments can be made that the long term investment makes them worth it, a lot of families just can't afford a $40,000-$80,000 vehicle.[[17]](https://www.energysage.com/electric-vehicles/costs-and-benefits-evs/electric-car-cost/) The prohibitive cost of EVs comes from battery manufacturing.  In order to make EVs a truly viable option battery technology needs to get cheaper.  Tesla and others are making promises that this is coming[[18]](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/07/envision-energy-says-ev-battery-cell-costs-will-fall-below-50-kwh-by-2025/), but historically, Tesla has overpromised and underdelivered.[[19]](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-tesla-always-overpromises-and-underdelivers-2015-10)  There were some other promising EV startups[[20]](https://www.google.com/search?q=elio+motors&rlz=1C1PRFI_enUS790US790&oq=elio+motors&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2221j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), but they tend to go defunct pretty quickly.[[21]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/six-electric-car-companies-that-aimed-big-and-124844221652.html)

EVs have a lot of promise, but they also have a long way to go.

##Deep Earth Geothermal Energy

The idea behind Deep Earth Geothermal energy is simple enough.  It's hot below ground, and the lower we drill the hotter it gets.  Deep Earth Geothermal uses fracking style technologies to open up holes deep below ground.  Then we pump water down one hole, and hot water comes out the other.  Using either a steam turbine or a binary power plant system, the water is cooled and reused, and electricity is produced.  [[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_geothermal_system)

Geothermal has been used in one way or another for a long time, and this technology looks promising.  Right now it is quite expensive, but thanks to fracking (/s), the technology has improved quickly and gotten cheaper.  There are a lot of potential hazards with this tech, however, including potentially destabilizing the land, releasing more greenhouse gasses into the air, and releasing toxic chemicals into the water supply.  (effectively the same risks as fracking).[[23]](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/environmental-impacts-geothermal-energy.html)

#Conclusion

These technologies, while promising, are all a long way out from total replacement of fossil fuel based industries.  

None of these technologies on their own will save us.  

All of these technologies implemented together alongside the planting of billions of trees, a significant push for recycling metals back into their raw forms for re-use, and government action to shut down the fossil fuel and industrial meat processing industries might save us.  

This is not hopium, it is realism.  We have a chance, but it will require a complete and total overhaul of our curret system.  It will require significantly higher taxes.  It will require every single person on earth getting on board.

Best-case energy transition scenarios will still result in severe climate change. Even if every renewable energy technology advanced as quickly as imagined and they were all applied globally, atmospheric CO2 levels wouldn’t just remain above 350 ppm; they would continue to rise exponentially due to continued fossil fuel use. 

So our best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change. Reversing the trend would require both radical technological advances in cheap zero-carbon energy, as well as a method of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and sequestering the carbon.[1](https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change), [2](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals)  

The speed and scale of transitions and of technological change required to limit warming to 1.5°C has been observed in the past within specific sectors and technologies. But the geographical and economic scales at which the required rates of change in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would need to take place, are larger and have no historic precedent.[3](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sr15/sr15_draft.pdf)","2019-07-18 16:32:41","25","LetsTalkUFOs","1747910985.391443","carbon capture","manual"

But we didn't, and emissions have soared even while temperatures are catching up to the carbon. Just think of the tanker video crashing into the port. We can steer, full power reverse, sound the alarm...it doesn't matter - we are crashing into that dock. The effects are already being felt, but scientists will be loathe to make direct connections to climate change well past the point of no return.  

The point is the carbon has already had a huge effect on our climate. The heat has been absorbed, and it's not going away. The albedo of the Arctic is changing yearly, and the phase change of the ice that's melted has already absorbed the necessary energy. The climate has changed and is continuing to become even hotter.  

Even if fusion becomes viable, we'll have to use concrete to make the plants, trucks to bring the materials, roads to allow the trucks in...it doesn't even become carbon neutral for years after it is built. Even if you invent carbon capture tech, you still have to produce them with energy and materials, the production of which produces carbon. You have to set them up somewhere, which takes fuel.

"eve32pv","t3_ceurev","ceurev","collapse","skeptical","Basically .. No.

Yes there are technological semi fixes. We could reduce CO2 and waste production by a significant percentage, but no we aren't going to. Investment and interest in climate change reducing technologies is driven by profit for the shareholder. If it's not ""sexy money"" it's not going to happen.

Salt cooled fission reactors? Nope. Too much R&D cost. Not interested.

LPG / Hybrid replacements for diesel / petrol fuelled vehicles? Nope. Investors want next gen Lithium batteries and an all electric solution. Yeah rape those rare earth metals, it costs 0 CO2 to extract that stuff and someone will figure out how to recycle the batteries in 2050. Maybe. But wow look at the investment returns on that new start up.

Solar and Wind? Well heck! We can do that one! Except for the CO2 cost of making them, and the potential for them to get devastated by increasingly common massive hailstones or extreme weather. Also it's not a 24hr power production solution, so let's reduce spending on that tech, and subsidise farming, jet fuel, cargo ship fuel instead. Because we need that right now. Right?

I mean just pause for a second. Look at the actual CO2 cost of making that next wind turbine or solar panel. Pretty much everything from digging the materials out of the ground, all through manufacturing the various components, to transporting it to the final place of installation .. and even all the travel to and from the installation point by the engineers putting it in place, is a CO2 cost. Every single step of the way.

It's a constant fail because the only way technology can help us out of this mess is by assisting a reduction in energy dependence and use, and that equals a (on the surface) lower standard of living for most of the global population. It would shrink GDP. The multi-national banks sitting on trillions of derivative investments would have a bad time. So no. That's not going to happen.

Put it another way. If Deutsch Bank did actually do a Lehman, the crash of 2008 would seem like a mini crash. A tiny blip. If you want to push total climate change above derivative profits, then far more than just Deutsch Bank would collapse. It's not just a climate collapse we are looking at. It's a restructuring of trillions of dollars to enable the scale of CO2 reducing directed action that we needed about 20 years+ ago.

I'm not one of the ""socialism will save us"" or ""eat the rich"" types. I think politics actually makes this even more impossible to solve than it was already. But technology is driven by economics, and economics in 2019 means we need a return on the investment. Unfortunately, dealing with climate change means making decisions which only reduce CO2 emissions and the average voter's standard of living, with no return on the investment. It's not going to happen.

""Tax carbon"" sounds like a neat solution, but holy crap, have we made a nightmare out of taxation or what? It seems those that should pay, don't! And those that can't afford to, have to. How many loopholes in carbon taxation can we imagine? It's like recycling your plastics only to find they got shipped to China, then Malaysia, then returned to your home country to be chucked in a land fill site. The feel good factor is YAY! The reality is .. nope. Carbon taxation is a theoretical economic dream. It doesn't address the real problems at source, and it ignores all the incredible way we find to dodge taxation (especially if we are rich).

The only fun question left is .. which dies first? Will global economics crash first and kill millions with paralysed trade and dead banks? Or will climate change kill millions while the banks pretend everything is still fine?

On that backdrop. Where do you put technology? It requires investment and directed purpose to make any significant change in climate outcome. Or perhaps BIG government intervention, and there are so many libertarians out there screaming that the solution to all the problems in the world is reducing government intervention.

Yes technology could theoretically help. But financially and politically, that would require a complete 180 degree shift in every political and financial expectation that's been accepted since around the 1970's/80's. I estimate the chance that a huge meteorite will hit the earth in the next 20 years, thus solving all our climate worries in just a few days, is bigger than than the financial and political change we need actually happening.

"euaq19p","t3_ceurev","ceurev","collapse","skeptical","OK You need to analyse what is collapse:

Civilisation depends on a few essential things

1. Air
2. Water
3. Food
4. Energy
5. Stability (Governance, Law and Order)

&#x200B;

Collapse would be triggered by the lack of any one of these essential ingredients.

&#x200B;

Now if we rephrase your question can technology provide any of the 5 essential ingredients of civilisation:

1. Technology can filter air from harmful/dangerous pollutants and oxygen can be supplied in limited supplies but only on the personal level we need a healthy ecosystem to maintain our oxygen supply.
2. In a climate changing world where a region's weather patterns are changing we will need drastic changes to how we capture/store and use water supplies, but technology can help massively here e.g. desalination.
3. As the climate warms and extreme weather events occur more frequently crop yields are going to suffer without the implementation of technology to mitigate drought and flooding.
4. Actually the easiest problem we have renewable energy solutions that we just need to ramp up and offset/replace fossil fuel energy provision, the tricky part is doing it fast enough.
5. Technology here can be a double edged sword, social media data can be misused to manipulate the populace as well as monitor it to improve law and order.  The rise in Automation is driving down the number of people needed and the wages paid for jobs.  In an economic system based on a working wage this is becoming a big destabilising issue that is driving up poverty and expanding the divide between the rich and poor.  Potential solutions are welfare, Universal Basic Income or a Human Time based economic system\*.

&#x200B;

\*Imagine a 100% automated world, humans would have zero economic value or worth unless we tie our economy to a Humans Time on earth:  Imagine an economy where every human generates a HT dollar every hour of every day they are alive.  This 7 billion dollar an hour economy would tie the automated industries to our needs and well being\*\*, in theory.

&#x200B;

\*\* In a HT economy people would be valued for being alive ergo, healthy and happy.  Migrants would bring wealth to a countries HTGDP economies.
