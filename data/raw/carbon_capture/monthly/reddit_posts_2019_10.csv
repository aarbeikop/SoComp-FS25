"dgq0km","climate","scientific","After trees ""capture"" carbon, do they release it all when they decompose / are burned?","Trees capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Then, if they decompose, they release carbon as matter, and material carbon is not an environmental problem.  Right?  \[Edit - add: If some percent returns to the atmosphere, do we know what percent?\]

If trees are burned (for heating / forest fire), do they release the same amount of carbon into the atmosphere that they captured during their life?

Oh - I guess the leaves that fall and decay would remain as material carbon.  Any idea how the mass of a lifetime of leaves compares to the dry mass of the tree itself?

Edit - add:  ---------- **My government is vowing to plant 2 billion trees if re-elected.  Sounds good, but is it?  If the carbon stored in trees is later released, is this just an election tactic that fails to make real change?** 

This post currently has 0 points. Why would someone down-vote this?  Is it not a good question?  It's certainly a sincere question from someone who's extremely concerned about the future.  Perhaps this subreddit is only for news, not for questions.  Based on their descriptions, it seems r/climate_science is the same, as is r/GlobalClimateChange.  I'll try r/climatechange \- it has no description.","2019-10-12 03:51:09","8","9","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/dgq0km/after_trees_capture_carbon_do_they_release_it_all/","True","I-Am-Electric","1747914042.2132502","carbon capture","manual"
"dg931v","collapse","skeptical","Carbon Capture Commercial","Just saw a commercial for Exxon mobile and how advanced their carbon capture tech will be.   They are actually a fantastic company who wants to save the planet.   The are cleaning up the environment inspite of you morons using plastic, eating meat, and traveling too much.  You all should be grateful for such an honest, altruistic company that is trying to prevent environmental problems before they happen.

"dmzv06","collapse","skeptical","Carbon capture","I find it interesting to keep abreast of new technologies, to not be caught flat-footed one way or another. This post concerns the latest development in carbon capture that looks somewhat interesting (siren call for pessimists):

[MIT Engineers Develop New Way to Remove Carbon Dioxide from the Air](http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-engineers-develop-new-way-remove-carbon-dioxide-air-1025)

The energy input is 277 Kwh to capture 1 ton of CO2. At commercial electricity rates of 3 cents that is about 8$ a ton. This does not include the cost of building the machine (which looks uncomplicated), or sequestering the carbon. Nevertheless it is a dramatic improvement in cost over other CC technologies, and at scale the costs would go down significantly. Let us say for simplicity the total cost to sequester CO2 were $10 a ton. And that in the past 263 years humans have emitted 1,480 billion tons. That works out to about 10.5 trillion dollars to bring us back to under 300 ppm. Now, that is a lot of money. However globally the world spends about 2 trillion each year just on defense. So if the 10.5 trillion were spread out over a few decades it would be well within the budget of countries willing to raise the taxes presumably a sort of VAT on purchases. There are many assumptions and unknowns like can the CO2 be sequestered, will the machine work at scale etc but I think it suggests potential solutions could be tried and that science will keep coming up with ways to keep BAU rolling along for as long as possible.","2019-10-25 16:26:42","0","20","0.42","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dmzv06/carbon_capture/","True","FF00A7","1747914154.4133801","carbon capture","manual"
"dnbyij","collapse","skeptical","Question regarding the term ""net-zero-emissions""","So we all probably heard the term net-zero-emissions, usually in the context that this amount of emissions should be achieved till date X (usually 2050)

My question is how much is this exactly? Everyone's talking about it and I looked it it up, but an exact (or even vague) amount is never mentioned.
Here's a [graph](https://ourworldindata.org/exports/annual-co-emissions-by-region_v7_850x600.svg) with yearly emissions. To where on this graph do we need to go back in order to archieve the ""net-zero""? 

I genuinely don't know and the reason why I care so much is because it means we have to achieve an alternate energy output within 30 years while going ""back in time"" with emissions. The problem with this is that the world population is aproaching 8 billion, 100 years ago it was aproaching 2 billion, merely a quarter of that.

I want to say that I have no qualifications whatsoever regarding climate/energy science, but something about this equation tells me it will not going so easy as big talk politicians make it out to be","2019-10-26 10:05:28","6","27","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dnbyij/question_regarding_the_term_netzeroemissions/","True","KuiperBE","1747914322.410893","carbon capture","manual"
