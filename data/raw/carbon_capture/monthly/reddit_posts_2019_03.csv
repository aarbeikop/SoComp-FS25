We all hope we can pressure politicians to do something. I think we have slim chances to convince the corrupt politicians in my country (Romania) and probably a lot of countries will have this issue. The 12 years deadline is pretty nasty.

What gives you hope? What makes you think we will fix this issue or at least what gives us the highest chances to fix it?","2019-03-16 15:42:47","24","38","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/b1trqx/what_gives_you_the_most_hope_about_fixing_the/","True","kickass_turing","1747905774.3929129","carbon capture","manual"

Basically, the Swedish airline BRA will start compensating for all released CO2 for all flights booked starting in April. They'll use some sort of European carbon capture tech but they haven't yet decided on which company to pertner with.

BRA also allows flyers to pay extra for fossil-free fuel, and has done so for some time.

This is a small but important step in the right direction! ","2019-03-07 14:03:58","52","3","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/aycxqm/swedish_airplane_company_bra_will_start_co2/","True","Dagusiu","1747906030.11712","carbon capture","manual"
"awt89k","collapse","skeptical","What I think everyone here is missing: Carbon sequestration","I´ve been looking at the cornucopian vs neomalthusian debate for over ten years now. I´ve generally found myself on the side of the neomalthusians. Permanent growth on a finite planet is impossible. Lately, I´ve found my position growing more nuanced: Permanent economic growth may be impossible, but if you shift your resources away from one sector of the economy and into new sectors that did not previously exist, you can have something akin to economic growth, without a growth in resource consumption. Economic growth can decouple from material consumption.

The thing I´ve tended to notice over the years, is that the neomalthusians have been too pessimistic about the impact that technological innovations can have on our way of life. As an example, peak oil was supposed to occur in 2008 and the economy was supposed to enter a gentle slope downwards afterwards. What happened in reality is that there was an economic shock, but it was followed by the exploitation of unconventional oil. So far, we see no evidence that the economy is suffering from cheap oil shortages. The goalposts were then moved further, now the problem was declining EROI from these unconventional oil deposits.

Simultaneously, we saw the emergence of electric passenger vehicles. Again, there was widespread skepticism. The vehicles merely drive on electricity from coal plants, they´re subsidy dumpsters, the battery range is inadequate and can´t be improved, there´s not enough lithium in the Earth´s crust, etcetera. And yet, here we are today, in a world where passenger vehicles can travel 300 miles on a battery. The batteries have become cheaper, more efficient and allow people to travel further.

Now if I have to extrapolate from what I´ve seen so far, the same principle will apply to carbon sequestration. Ask the average Neomalthusian what will happen to these projects that sequester carbon in the rocks of Iceland or similar projects elsewhere and you´ll hear that it can´t be scaled, that it´s too expensive, that governments have no incentive to work along on it, etcetera. And yet, we´ve seen these arguments about every previous innovation that saved the day. In fact, I wasn´t around back then, but I´ḿ somewhat willing to hazard a guess and say that I would have seen the same scenario play out in the 1970´s, when optimists were pointing to rising yields and declining fertility rates, while pessimists were predicting imminent global mass starvation.

It´s true that carbon sequestration is too expensive today, but what everyone seems to be missing is that we have every reason to expect the same thing to happen that we saw in most other technological domains: Improvements in the technology itself will allow the price to come down to the point where we find ourselves able to deal with the crisis we face. Based on the decline in costs we´ve seen so far and extrapolating into the future, we would expect the technology for carbon sequestration to become viable for broad deployment [in the 2040´s](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/if-carbon-tech-follows-batterys-path-co2-capture-could-be-super-cheap-by-20).

So, there´s an argument to be made that the 2040´s will be way too late to avoid catastrophe. There are a few things that have to be noted however. To start with, it´s generally agreed that the impact of climate change will be disproportionately felt in those nations with the least economic development. In sub-Saharan Africa we can expect major problems by 2040. In Europe and North America, the scientific consensus doesn´t necessarily suggest major problems would emerge by that point in time. Hint: Guy McPherson doesn´t just find himself far outside of the consensus interpretation of the available evidence, his conclusions are simply irreconcilable with the available evidence. Sea-level rise is a process that decades to catch up with the temperature rise, agricultural yields are generally thought to increase in most developed countries as winter gets warmer.

Finally, we have to note that the impact of climate change is catastrophic, precisely because it happens to people who are isolated from the economic system around them. As a farmer in Africa you die of hunger during a drought, because you depend on animal husbandry or a narrow range of crops. You depend on your traditional method of food production, because you don´t have a bank account, because don´t have crop insurance that would allow you to buy food from the local village during a year of drought, because you didn´t receive the education that allows you to figure out which crops are drought-resistant. The lower your level of economic development, the greater your dependence on a narrow range of ecological variables. The hunter-gatherers of Papua New Guinean highlands die of hunger when the local megafauna are hunted into extinction, the Japanese cultivate seaweed in the ocean and consume fermented soybeans.

Overall, based on the evidence I have seen, my conclusion is as following: Don´t place all your bets on one outcome. I´m not in a position where I can comfortably rule out catastrophe, but based on what I read, I really don´t arrive at the conclusion prevalent here, that catastrophe is already baked into the equation.

My suggestion instead would be to live within our ecological means and to encourage other people to do the same. Don´t be a nihilist who pretends that nothing matters anymore. Live a sober life. Enjoy the little things. Nature is beautiful. You don´t need to visit a tropical beach on the other side of the world to figure that out. You´re healthier and happier if you eat less meat, the planet as a whole benefits too. Your body thrives when you ride a bicycle or walk around. You´ll save money too. You grow weak and decadent if you travel everywhere by car.

We live in a bridge period, where we have to live within our means, as we work to develop the technologies that will allow us to reverse the damage we inflicted on our surroundings. If you pretend that everything is already lost and hopeless, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Let me end with an example of what I mean. When I was a ten year old boy, I decided to become a vegetarian, when I found myself capable of comprehending the suffering necessary to put meat on the table. This was a difficult decision. Restaurants had no vegetarian options, teachers and parents suggested they could just scoop up the meat balls out of soup for me. Today it is no longer difficult. These days I experience that there are enough of us at every party, at every company, at every occasions, to require people to take us into consideration. It´s a faux pas if you don´t have vegetarian food options, supermarkets have entire vegetarian shelves, every takeaway outlet now has vegetarian options, even vegans are catered too. Some music festivals in Amsterdam now serve only vegetarian food. The world has changed in my own lifetime. The reason the world changed is because some people chose to live by example and the society around them had to adjust to it. Instead of choosing nihilism, I want to recommend to everyone: Live by example, in accordance to the values that you find important in life.","2019-03-03 11:33:36","21","29","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/awt89k/what_i_think_everyone_here_is_missing_carbon/","True","milkversussoy","1747906659.678824","carbon capture","manual"
