"e03mpuw","t3_8oidjq","8oidjq","collapse","skeptical","One more point to add is that the commentary I'm seeing there is reflective of the slow awakening to the reality of government surveillance/the acceptance that some ""conspiracy theories"" are actually legitimate, and always were. 

People online in general went from ridiculing ""conspiracy nuts"" to suddenly discussing the topics at hand with one another, now devoid of incredulity, angry as they should be. The same thing is happening in that comment section - no denial, no ridicule, no bargaining (""If you aren't doing anything wrong, their surveillance doesn't matter!"") about the climate predicament. 

The takeaway being that within a handful of years this will likely be very common sentiment. ","2018-06-04 16:52:39","62","fuckacollapse","1747896759.184978","carbon capture","manual"
"e03padr","t3_8oidjq","8oidjq","collapse","skeptical","It's also interesting how opposition has changed its approach over the years. This past year especially has been a heavy shift from outright denial, to allegedly ""scientific"" explanations as to why this is all normal, or OK. 

There are several new phrases being disseminated, two fairly recent ones being ""CO2 is plant food"" and ""The sun is the overwhelming driver of climate change, look up the Maunder Minimum, this is all the unstoppable power of the sun, nothing to do with human activity.""","2018-06-04 17:29:58","42","fuckacollapse","1747896759.187188","carbon capture","manual"
"e03utzw","t3_8oidjq","8oidjq","collapse","skeptical","I'm in that thread, it seems the message is getting out there, but there is still resistance or nefarious astro-turfing i cant tell. One thing is clear though, people are more receptive than at any point in recent history. The tipping point might have happened.

>But there is another reason why the past focus on industrialization will wane. We know already (deep in our hearts) that there is little increased satisfaction in never-ending growth in the per capita consumption of food and manufactured goods. Once well fed, warm, safe, and comfortable, most humans yearn for more abstract satisfaction. Never-ending growth in material consumption and energy use may generate marginal improvements for some individuals but will be easily overwhelmed by the negative side effects for the masses when everyone tries to emulate the rich—because we live on a finite planet. Thus sooner or later, the industrial revolution will be followed by the sustainability revolution. This is the era when the main objective of nations will be to evolve a national society that can be sustained in the long run both physically and mentally. It will start in the rich countries and spread to the rest of the world later in this century. I can’t tell you exactly what this future society will look like. But I am willing to bet that the overriding ambition will not be “fossil-fueled economic growth” but rather “sustainable well-being.""","2018-06-04 18:49:19","29","YoIIo","1747896759.191434","carbon capture","manual"

I've also found it encouraging that youtube videos on climate change have less of the typical ' global hoax!!!1' crap that used to be commonplace and more intelligent comments instead. I've even had some reasonable discussions there of late when I couldn't resist correcting someone on a comment and surprisingly it didn't result in a senseless flamewar but an intelligent conversation.","2018-06-04 17:59:06","22","Fredex8","1747896759.195071","carbon capture","manual"

"e048pml","t3_8oidjq","8oidjq","collapse","skeptical","I look at and care about various infrastructure technology as well. Things will definitely collapse because nothing is stopping it from doing so and that's the economiv direction. Economy also dictates how we treat the ecosystem.  But when things collapse the world isn't entirely dead and survivability is a concern and having technology to recover a new system over a long and hard path is still worth looking into. The idea isn't yay everything's going to be alright, but, yay we found a way to not completely die off and survive in some manner and try to bring knowledge with us. The worst part would be surviving and forgetting how we failed (and most people will fight tooth and nail to ignore it. And even if we help recovery of the ecosystem in the future that's still useful for humanity even if it's not useful for us now. Just lying back and saying fuck it isn't better, but neither is ripping your hair about it. Shit's going to go bad, figure out what works for you and try to live how you can. Because sure humanity may never be the same - but isn't that what we want... Because the same is causing this shit. But that doesn't mean no humanity whatsoever, it might, but any chance is worth fighting for as a civilization.","2018-06-04 22:19:15","6","Elektribe","1747896759.207117","carbon capture","manual"

 history paints a rather callous pciture of civic death almost all hunter gatherer types  gone almost all civilisations are gone all that remains are remenants of  hunter gatherer lifestyles  at the sentinel islands and  the amazon  and parts of indonesia whati s left is industrial civilisation and its a energy sucker it allowed the human population to grow to 7 billion and when it ends which it will it will be catastrophic.

there is  delusion with us we think we can terraform mars when we can't stop what is going on on planet earth.
