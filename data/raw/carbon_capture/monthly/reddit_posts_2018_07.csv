"8ykgdv","collapse","skeptical","Carbon Capture with Soils = 5 billion tons per year by 2050 = Nowhere enough","After reducing projected emissions by 700 billion tons in 20 years, we have to suck 10 billion tons of year out of the air forever after to avoid 2° C.

The most optimistic scenario says we can hope to remove 5 billion tons of carbon per year by 2050. This is clearly ineffectual.

We can remove up to 5 gtons/year by 2050.

But, we are putting up to 40 gtons/year now. 

We will put up 700 billion tons by 2040.

We have to emit 0 gtons/year by 2040 to avoid 2° C.  

2° C = Disaster says James Hansen.

Removing 5 gtons/year by 2050 is not enough.

We have to remove at least 10 gtons/year after 2040 every single year to avoid 2° C.﻿

"90qpd2","collapse","skeptical","760MM trees were planted in Pakistan. By my math, that reduces CO2 emissions by a whopping 0.05%","I saw a post in r/Futurology about the amazing ""Billion Tree Project"" in Pakistan, which got me to thinking: what impact does that many trees really have? Here's the hasty approximate math I did in a comment:

A young tree captures ~50lb of CO² a year (on the high end). That means all those trees capture about 16.5 million metric tons a year. Last year, we emitted just over 38 billion tons of CO².

Those 700 million trees only reduced our planetary emissions of carbon dioxide by about 0.05%.

Yes, planting trees is a good thing! But the perspective of how little an impact it makes in contrast to carbon-spewing coal plants is shocking.
