All energy used to do carbon capture and sequestering would have to be zero carbon. Any fossil fuel used in the action negates some of the total captured.","2018-07-13 14:45:43","4","Rhaedas","1747898111.719651","carbon capture","manual"
"e2f2www","t3_8ykgdv","8ykgdv","collapse","skeptical","1) C or CO2? Current rough fossil fuel consumption is ~ 10Gt/yr which is ~ 30GtCO2/yr

2) Scale. I don't believe we know how to do CSS even remotely anywhere near 5 GtCO2/yr by several orders of magnitude. Even if we did know HOW to do this, I don't believe we have a clue how to generate the energy required to do it. 

---

10GtC/Yr turned into 30GtCO2/yr until the 1TtC of easily accessible fossil carbon is all gone. In one last #terafart. Leading to a temperature rise of at least 5C. And 200k years before CO2 and temperatures drop back again to pre-industrial levels.","2018-07-15 08:16:41","1","jbond23","1747898111.7247622","carbon capture","manual"

So the only way to max out this potential using trees is to plant them, grow them as saplings, then harvest them while young and bury them deep underground while planting more. Without causing emissions with all that planting, cutting, and burying. Doing a similar thing with simpler plant life such as algae that has a faster life cycle would be better, but the same emissions restrictions apply, otherwise you're wasting energy and time canceling out the effort.","2018-07-21 17:07:37","22","Rhaedas","1747898489.972885","carbon capture","manual"

"e2sl104","t3_90qpd2","90qpd2","collapse","skeptical","Yeah...I ran the numbers a while back and came up with US emissions alone needing a treefarm the size of the US minus Alaska and Texas to offset, and that was if we buried the trees in a zero-emissions way. Planting trees is completely inconsequential given the scale of our emissions.","2018-07-21 18:54:24","10","hammertime84","1747898489.9781408","carbon capture","manual"
