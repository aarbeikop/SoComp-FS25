Have any efforts been made to run CMIP5 class climate models (or others) in an effort to minimize 21st century warming (perhaps its even possible to induce cooling some parameter regimes) under the constraints of a 1850-2000 hindcast, just to see what it would look like?


It seems to me that this kind of work is necessary to settle once in for all whether models really have too many tunable parameters to make reliable projections. I know people check sensitivity of climate sensitivity to various parameters but I haven't seen anyone actively try to produce the coolest 2100 temperatures while still matching the observational record.

"dj8suph","t3_6isyum","6isyum","science","scientific","In terms of solutions, isn't the overall effect that consumers have on global warming minuscule compared to manufacturing, energy, and agricultural industries? With waste production, people can recycle and reuse old containers, but that effort is a drop in the bucket that is quickly being filled by the aforementioned industries. My question is, can consumer habits truly change the trends in global warming? If everybody stopped eating animal products (the single largest source of greenhouse gasses), it would certainly make a substantial difference, but that will never happen. The most realistic scenario is that even if a growing number of people in the United States and Europe reduce their consumption of animal products, that reduction will be negated by the expanding middle class in developing countries. The question being, again, is individual responsibility in changing habits going to have any effect?

Edit: for clarity, I do believe that veganism and a priority towards waste-to-energy practices should be integral in our overall environmental policy, both as individual consumers and as commercial or political bodies.","2017-06-22 12:13:41","27","Sonseh","1747882510.146938","carbon capture","manual"
"dj949lf","t3_6isyum","6isyum","science","scientific","How much impact does personal change of lifestyle have? I would think a lot since without consumers large industries and corporations have no reason to do anything.

Over the months I have read scientific research and compiled as short as possible list of personal changes every person can make. Can you please look at it and see if I'm mistaken about something.


FOOD:

* **eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products (none is the best)**
* eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated, and produces plastic waste so drink tap water)
* eat proper portion sizes
* remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment so adopt don’t shop to discourage their production, and choose pets that are herbivores

ENERGY:

* **drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible, avoid flying**
* use efficient lightbulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room
* Unplug devices when not in use (to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet, some are very cheap)
* insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary
* criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much
* forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing. (that way more people get to live on less land, sharing walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.)
* buy solar panels
* don't be afraid of nuclear power plants

WASTE

* avoid items with too much packaging
* don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging)
* buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
* recycle
* avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery and cups e.g. bring reusable tumbler to Starbucks, disposable wipes, disposable plastic bags, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.)
* contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging

WATER:

* don't flush the toilet when not necessary
* don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids, and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...)
* turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc.
* cut down on showers and baths
* don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering 

ACTIVISM:

* Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle (feel free to share this list)
* Donate money to environmental charities
* Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicians
* Look into buying carbon emission offset (this is the only point on this list that I haven't researched yet, so I'm not sure)

I recently watched Cowspiracy, a documentary on how the world’s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about animal agriculture as being the primary reason for climate change (let alone numerous other problems) as encouraging more environmentally sustainable diets and apparently repels 'supporters' of these organizations. Instead of focusing on the fact that it takes ~660 gallons of water to make a hamburger, or ~4 gallons of water for a gallon of milk, these organizations encourage us that the transportation and domestic sectors are the primary reasons for climate change and other environmental ills. They tell us to fix leaky faucets and to do other small tasks as people do not like larger commitments.

In your opinion, what do you think must happen in order to spark this commitment? A grassroots movement? Education? More radical journalism which exposes the animal industry? Are we too late?

> I also lead an interdisciplinary centre looking at climate solutions, and I would welcome a discussion of ideas on possible solutions. Does solar geoengineering or large-scale carbon capture and storage have legs? Where should we concentrate research effort? Any whacky ideas we should look into?

I think that its likely changing the climate maybe an _easier_ challenge that changing human nature, at least in the short term, and therefore one of the most promising routes out of the climate challenges we are facing is a capitalistic one. If something is good (or less bad) for the planet _and_ makes financial sense it generally seems to appeal to those on both sides of the political spectrum. 

With this is mind, are they any avenues which you feel have potential to re-work markets while favouring the environment?

Two areas I am interested in are Carbon capture with manufacturing and hemp!

In the last year or two I have seen there are some recent developments in terms of cost effective carbon capture from the atmosphere, but also some talk about how carbon fibre [may be carcinogenic](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11944536) and not ideal to use as a manufacturing material. I would be really interested if you have any thoughts or ideas on this subject? Sometimes people mention that the ideal carbon capture and manufacturing concept already exists in the tree, which is of course true, but not a solution to our problems as the capital yield at present for woodland is too small to be valued enough to keep around it seems. Carbon fibre seems like a magical material due to its strength, versatility, and recyclability. I cant help thinking of all the hard waste in landfill that could transition to being carbon based. 

Regarding hemp, there are not many developments in the last number of decades to ease production that I am aware of. The blocker for using hemp for clothing and paper (in an innumerably more ecologically friendly way than woodland) has been / is largely political. The tide seems to be turning at present and de-regulation of industrial (and other forms) of hemp in various nations. Have you performed (or are you aware of) any research of moving away from cotton and wood pulp and its effects on the environment? Any other thoughts on this area? (I know in the UK a university in North Wales have been looking at strains for cultivation in colder climates which could see a growth of the industry again here).

Yes, it's expensive and possibly dangerous (earthquakes, releasing of CO2 back into atmosphere), but without more companies building ccs technology we'll never know. Do you think that if a carbon tax was applied, would it be enough of an incentive for a company to invest in ccs? Look at Norway, carbon taxing themselves and capturing/storing CO2 under the sea for the last 20 years without incident.
