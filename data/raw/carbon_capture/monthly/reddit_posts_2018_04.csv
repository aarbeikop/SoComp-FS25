So there you have it. Even if we don't run out of water and food, all hell will break loose within 20 years at most.

We have to reduce emissions 100% in 20 years or life on earth dies. But our emissions are projected to rise 16% by then.

When scientists say we have to reduce human emissions 100% by 2040, they've included non-existent carbon capture technology in their projections.

In reality we have to reduce human emissions 100% in 10 years. This is impossible.

I've grown up watching wall-e and avatar that supposedly tries to blame humanity as a whole, including you. Well, individually, there is nothing I can do about money and arbitrarily nations ruling the world instead of common sense and working together. We could still slay carbon output enormously, already 50% with just carbon capture technology in plants but policy makers... just... don't do it.","2018-04-20 08:09:27","44","54","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/8dlzkw/youre_not_responsible/","True","gergytat","1747893723.0599139","carbon capture","manual"
