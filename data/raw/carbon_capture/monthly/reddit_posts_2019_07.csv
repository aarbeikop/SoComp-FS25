"ccuo58","climatechange","action-oriented","Meeting with Congressman, are there any qualified persons willing to peer review an article I'm presenting on 100% clean energy?","I'm a college student from Washington State and after meeting with a conservative leader to discuss climate change reform, I got the excuse that 100% clean energy, despite there being a bill being passed for it, is a pipe dream in my state because we don't have sufficient battery capacity in any modern technology to support the power grid. I suspected that this was a well crafted deflection, a ploy allowing them to continue opposing climate change reform while pretending to support it, so I did a little research.

I found this article *Response to ‘Burden of proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems’*. It's a great article that refutes many of the arguments perpetrated by those who wish to prolong the use of fossil fuels.

I'm having a follow up meeting with him soon and would like to have my bases covered. If there's anyone who's rather knowledgeable in the field and wouldn't mind independently reviewing the article the link to it is here [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.113](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.113) . Please include proof of your degree/experience in the field.

Edit: Just to clarify, I did not write this article, I found it when researching.","2019-07-13 21:21:37","68","27","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ccuo58/meeting_with_congressman_are_there_any_qualified/","True","khankhisto","1747910457.399632","carbon capture","manual"
"cfpkhw","environment","emotional","Assuming a Budget of 200$, is there anything we can build at home that will capture carbon more efficiently than a plant, or several plants?","I have 200 to spend and i really want to get into individual carbon capture, thinking of it similar to how solar panels or the tesla roof would decentralize electricity generation. So assuming a budget of 200 or even less, is there a simple or relatively simple device that I can build at home to do that? I would buy solar panels or solar plastic to power it in my backyard. Eventually maybe have several.","2019-07-20 19:09:53","8","5","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/cfpkhw/assuming_a_budget_of_200_is_there_anything_we_can/","True","Homiusmaximus","1747910694.013796","carbon capture","manual"
