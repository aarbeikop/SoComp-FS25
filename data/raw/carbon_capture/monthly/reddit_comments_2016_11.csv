1. Stop using fossil fuels. *This would slow or collapse the economy.*
2. Find a way to remove carbon from the air in a scale that would work and a cost that would work. *No one has a solution for scaled Carbon removal.*
3. Begin global dimming asap. *This would have to be done all around the world 24/7* *No one knows the side effects*

"dacybyb","t3_5ejo3v","5ejo3v","collapse","skeptical","Well, removing enough carbon fast enough or safe albedo modulation may be practically impossible.  Aside from that, there may be enough methane in the arctic that is subject to warming-induced release that at some point anthropogenic CO2 will be insignificant compared to natural carbon sources.

Over the summer I calculated (very roughly) the amount of energy required to fix enough CO2 to C-C bonds to reduce CO2 levels to pre-industrial levels. Just the deltaH for that amount of carbon fixation, at 100% efficiency, is in the neighborhood of 2.226x10^19 kJ.  For comparison, one gallon of gasoline contains 1.3x10^5 kJ.  (If anyone wants to see the calcs, source data, and assumptions just let me know.)  Carbon capture using human controlled energy is probably a pipe dream.

I'm far from prepared.  I am thinking about how one could survive 6 degC, ""hot house Earth"" conditions.  At the very least, I hope I've helped calibrate expectations about carbon capture.","2016-11-23 21:15:10","10","Whereigohereiam","1747875645.61341","carbon capture","manual"
"dade6xp","t3_5ejo3v","5ejo3v","collapse","skeptical","When you spark an engine, you break molecular bonds and produce three times the amount of GHGs from the original carbon bond that was in your gas tank. The burning hydrocarbons break apart and recombine with air to produce CO2 weighing three times more than the original hydrocarbon. To try to reverse this process and sequester the CO2 that now exists as a diffuse gas is energy intensive and cost prohibitive; recent successful efforts are confined to small laboratory experiments and won't scale up to the current gargantuan level of emissions from several hundred years of constant planet-wide fossil fuel burning. [Since 1750, humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 60%, adding nearly 1,350 gigatons of CO2](https://protonsforbreakfast.wordpress.com/2015/03/16/co2-emissions-still-a-big-and-growing-problem/), and we're still emitting on the order of 40 gigatons every year.

>""...no one really believes we have yet reached ‘peak emissions’. And that means the ongoing disaster is still getting worse.""

The yearly global consumption of fossil fuels today is [equivalent](http://www.zeroco2.no/introduction/frequently-asked-questions) to the output from 50 million wind turbines. ([At the end of 2015](http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/wind-in-numbers/), there were 314,000 wind turbines in use around the world)

"dadevvd","t3_5ejo3v","5ejo3v","collapse","skeptical","It's the scale of the problem. We'd have to remove a cubic mile of CO2 ice every year to even make a dent in the growth curve. To merely stop the CO2 rise we'd need to slash our carbon use by half and capture 3  cubic miles of carbon dioxide every year. Capturing that much carbon would regardless of the method employed be a global industrial undertaking similar in scale to the current oil industry. Where these thousands of billions of dollars would come from or what energy source would power this industry, I do not know. 

This industry wouldn't provide any real economic output in the short term. It would all be a huge money and resource sink in exchange for our long-term survival. It would be very unpopular to invest something like 5% of the global GDP to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere because it would directly damage people's quality of life in the short term.

Where this CO2 would go is also an unknown. There aren't enough empty oil wells or salt mines on this planet to lock away hundreds of cubic miles of solid/liquid CO2. Perhaps we'll break the CO2 into carbon or process it into limestone, I do not know, but this process would require further energy, resources, capital and manpower. Again we would be talking about a global enterprise shadowing pretty much everything else we do except perhaps the fossil fuel industry and the global military forces combined.","2016-11-24 04:13:28","5","Elukka","1747875645.619228","carbon capture","manual"

"dadppws","t3_5ejo3v","5ejo3v","collapse","skeptical","We can. The climate system is less complex than the human body and we know, through modern medicine, how to fix it. The difference is that in medicine we've had centuries of research and millions of bodies to experiment on. We only have one climate system to research. Whatever method we use to heal it will be completely experimental. We only get one chance.

To continue the analogy, right now the climate system is like a human eating too much. High cholesterol , high blood sugar, high blood pressure they all accumulate until an organ reaches a point of failure. It's the same with the climate system. Organs like the Arctic sea ice are being eroded by the constant abuse and at some point it will fail.

We could have avoided this by reducing CO2  slowly over the years until we achieved a healthy balance. Instead we kept at it. Now we need medicine, but we have no lab rats to test if it works. We must test on the patient. If the medicine happens to be poison we won't know until is too late.","2016-11-24 11:34:11","1","Archimid","1747875645.6281831","carbon capture","manual"

I'm sure we will begin global programs of geoengineering, but I am skeptical of promised outcomes. Making assumptions on future technologies and budgets is very difficult. It's typical in mega projects like this to promise something and then go way over budget and miss targets.
