If you can sequester more carbon with this technology than you offset by replacing generation then it is a win.    It's probably  better return on investment to use the wind generated power to offset coal and gas based generation than to start arc based sequestration.  When we get to carbon neutral then maybe it's time to kick in some energy intensive sequestration technology.

BTW there is no need to store energy that you are going to use to generate a sequestration arc.  Just let it arc whenever it's generating.     Also, currently the most effective sequestration technology is to plant trees.","2019-04-25 16:01:31","8","crashorbit","1747907294.3686779","carbon capture","manual"
"elr7l6v","t3_bha003","bha003","climatechange","action-oriented","So what do you think about the scaling-up potential of this technology? 

It seems like energy might be the constraint, even though it's pretty available at the grid's production point. 

If the necessary minimum amount of electrically disassembled CO2 is 100 million metric tons per year — how much energy would that require?

Here's what the governments in charge will do, they will start sinking billions into atmospheric injection and carbon capture.

>What response will different nations have? 

Theatre to indifference... same as last time because the nations citizens won't tolerate solutions.  Politicians know that,voters lead, politicans follow. It's why nothing substantive is done, so theatre is all that's left.  Greta etal don't understand that yet, the ""enemy"" isn't the politicians, it's her fellow citizens.

>Will this have any impact in the global denial of the impacts of climate change?

No...  because the problems insoluble.  The problem is greed and denial, these were possibly valuable traits (albeit I am not sure about greed but denial was) in millenia past but not now.

But don't look to random redditors, look to nobel laureates in human behaviour

>climate change activist George Marshall interviews the Nobel prizewinning psychologist Daniel Kahneman, the leading scholar of cognitive biases, and tries to nudge him into saying that understanding our brains’ limitations will, at the very least, make it easier to overcome them. “I’m not very optimistic about that,” Kahneman replies, despondently sipping tomato soup. “No amount of psychological awareness will overcome people’s reluctance to lower their standard of living. So that’s my bottom line: there is not much hope. I’m thoroughly pessimistic. I’m sorry.”
