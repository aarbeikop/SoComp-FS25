Wrong. Global warming has absolutely nothing to do with the greenhouse effect (aka convection limiting).

Co2 absorbs IR at specific wavelengths... it also EMITS just as well. AKA its a better conductor of heat then normal air. Because of this ability to conduct those specific wavelengths of light more efficently, Co2 is predicted to lower upper atmospheric temperatures, which contracts the global surface area of the ""atmopsheric window"" where Co2 finally allows IR through to space(around 2.7 and 15 um). This contraction is the where the heating is predicted to come from.

For visualization, imagine a fluffy ball of wire, with a piece of red hot plutonium inside. the wire conducts heat away from the plutonium core and radiates it into space. The plutonium is earth and the wire is the atmosphere. Co2 has the effect of increasing the thermal conductivity(plastic to cooper) of the wires(atmosphere) to such a degree that the entire ball of wires shrinks, reducing surface area that can radiate heat. The core of plutonium is still putting off X number of watts, but in a smaller ball of wire. Because the ball of wire shrunk, the temperature delta would be greater, and thus any point inside of the surface layer would be marginally hotter.

To date... this has not been proven... mostly because there is no evidence that the [Mie scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering) layer has actually lowered in altitude, as climate models predicted. We are talking about 5-10 meters of change for this layer, at 5-10 km in altitude.

This is a totally understandable feeling, but there is a handy solution which I try to point out to anyone who wants to make a difference in the world: Somewhere in your local community, there are people and families who lack basic needs. A modest donation from just one person can make a huge difference to an entire family. That's where the greatest bang for your buck is, in terms of improving the state of the world generally: Local action to help needy individuals. 

>Our generation have grown up with ""the world is ending"" messages

Not really. If you live in a rich country which is mostly insulated from political instability, then your generation have grown up in the wealthiest conditions ever experienced, and growth has always been forecast to continue. The ""world is ending"" messages come from very unreliable sources, which anyone with a minimal amount of effort can filter out in favor of more reliable ones. Those sources are just trying to manipulate you for their own ends; the way to resist that manipulation is to think for yourself instead.

>Not sure how to effectively help. I'm broke and I don't have any skills.

Then it's easy to identify some steps for you here: Help yourself first. Depending on which country you live in, you might be *totally surrounded* by wealth and by people who want to instruct you in valuable skills. If you're even slightly motivated, you can leverage those offerings to create pretty substantial benefits, at least in your local community.

Right, we don't yet have the science or technology to manage the global carbon cycle, which is the fundamental problem here.

What is most sad about the whole situation in my opinion is that as a species we have the capability, but we seem to lack the will though.  Your example in particular is relying only upon direct air capture of carbon, which is pretty much the worst way to go about it at the moment.  In general terms it takes a lot of energy, a lot of effort, and the level of technology could be better.  Not to say it's useless, and I would encourage further research, but it's a bit of a lost cause at taking up *all* the slack that we need.

Better options include flogging our rocks into absorbing more carbon (yeah, seriously) by artificially accelerating the production of carbonates to lock the carbon into rock.  Growing trees or algae is also a solid choice, and then either using the wood, or burning the whole lot and capturing the CO2 to inject into an available storage site.  Essentially, this involves the rock absorbing/mineralising the CO2, which also happens much faster than originally thought.  That said, people are still concerned about earthquakes and so on.  I don't think there is nearly as much risk as people think, just be a bit sensible about these things, perhaps not directly on a fault line?

The production of biochar is another great idea, and one that does need to be investigated carefully I think - take the trees from above, and pyrolyse them, i.e. burn them without oxygen.  This forms charcoal, which you can then seed into soil, replenishing the soil, enhancing crop yields, and locking in carbon for a solid timespan.  There is some issue regarding just how long the carbon takes to come back out, which is why I say it should be done carefully, but I think some large scale trials are long overdue in this area.

I don't know the current scale of all of these technologies, but the BECCS option - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-energy\_with\_carbon\_capture\_and\_storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-energy_with_carbon_capture_and_storage) \- has now passed the million tons per year point.  Not exactly all bunnies, unicorns and rainbows, but it is certainly at pilot scale.  Only another four orders of magnitude to go, at least one of which will simply be scale out (5 facilities thus far), but there are some economic and logistic issues that need sorting first.

Very lastly, *there are* devices that literally pull the carbon dioxide out the air.  Getting it from the concentrations it is at is insanely difficult, but it can be done.  Bill Gates is on the case, don't you know!

Fortunately, initial efforts at CO2 sequestration via iron fertilization of the oceans is lookng very promising - and replenishes fish stock:

http://nextbigfuture.com/2014/06/120-tons-of-iron-sulphate-dumped-into.html

http://nextbigfuture.com/2014/06/bureaucracy-and-hurdles-for-attempting.html

The study has shown that ""a substantial proportion of carbon from the induced algal bloom sank to the deep sea floor. These results, which were thoroughly analysed before being published now, provide a valuable contribution to our better understanding of the global carbon cycle.""

""Over 50 per cent of the plankton bloom sank below 1000 metre depth indicating that their carbon content can be stored in the deep ocean and in the underlying seafloor sediments for time scales of well over a century.""

""Iron Fertilization helps restore fish populations. In 2012, the distribution of 120 tons of iron sulfate into the northeast Pacific to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom which in turn would provide ample food for baby salmon.""

""The verdict is now in on this highly controversial experiment: It worked. In fact it has been a stunningly over-the-top success. This year, the number of salmon caught in the northeast Pacific more than quadrupled, going from 50 million to 226 million. In the Fraser River, which only once before in history had a salmon run greater than 25 million fish (about 45 million in 2010), the number of salmon increased to 72 million.""

""The cost for iron fertilization would be “ridiculously low” as compared with any other possible method of carbon sequestration. For quite seriously all you need to do is throw rubbish over the side of the ship to make it happen.""

""No, really: ferrous sulphate is a waste product of a number of different industrial processes (if I’m recalling correctly, one source would be the production of titanium dioxide for making white paint, a large industry) and it really is a waste. It gets thrown into holes in the ground""

According to Next Big Future the iron used in ocean fertilization results in a plankton bloom, which massively increases fish stocks (120 tons of iron sulfate became 100,000 tons of salmon. The plankton not eaten by the fish dies and settles on the ocean floor taking the CO2 used to build their bodies with them in permanent sequestration.

The sequestration is accomplished at a rate of:

""Recent research has expanded this constant to ""106 C: 16 N: 1 P: .001 Fe"" signifying that in iron deficient conditions each atom of iron can fix 106,000 atoms of carbon, or on a mass basis, each kilogram of iron can fix 83,000 kg (83 metric tonnes)of carbon dioxide.""

Global CO2 emissions in 2013 were estimated to be 33.4 billion metric tonnes from fossil fuels and cement production. Using the ratio above, a bit more than 400,000,000 kilograms (400,000 metric tonnes) of iron sulphate could sequester our CO2 emissions each year - about 3,333 times the amount used in the experiment cited by NBF. This actually sounds doable in the ocean fisheries around the globe.

More than that would reduce the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Possibly resulting in global cooling.

A single ultra large crude tanker has a capacity of 550,000 dead weight tonnes - 150,000 tonnes more than what would be needed to sequester annual CO2 emissions.","2019-12-31 10:33:19","5","[deleted]","1747915434.118955","carbon capture","manual"

We won't solve global warming with renewables alone.

What the the world needs is a new movement of high tech, nuclear loving, tree hugging hippies.

OK, let's crunch some numbers for global warming and climate change, and the only realistic solution - nuclear power.


Amount of CO2 sent into the atmosphere by human activities
= 32,000,000,000 tons per year

Fraction retained in the atmosphere (not absorbed by existing carbon sinks)
= 43%

Annual accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere
= 13,760,000,000 tons / year


Life cycle CO2 emissions from coal power plants
= 820 g of CO2 / kWh

Life cycle CO2 emissions from nuclear power plants
= 12 g of CO2 / kWh

Life cycle CO2 reduction using nuclear power plants
= 808 g of CO2 / kWh
= 1.75 lbs of CO2 / kWh


Amount of energy to be replaced and eliminate CO2 accumulation
= 15,725,714,285,714 kWh per year
= 15,725,714,286 MWh per year

Power output of large nuclear power plant (Palo Verde, 3 each 1338 MW reactors))
= 4,000 MW
= 35,040,000 MWh per year


Number of large nuclear plants required to replace coal plants emitting excess CO2
= 449 each
= 1,796 1 MW reactors


Capital cost of nuclear power plant (Palo Verde, 3 each 1338 MW reactors)
= $5,900,000,000
Total Capital Costs
= $2,647,879,973,907


About $2.5 Trillion, double to $5 trillion in today's dollars


World GDP (2016)
= $75.4 trillion


Summary: There are currently 467 operational nuclear power plants world wide. We can eliminate all excess CO2 by adding another 450 plants, or about 1,350 each 1338 MW reactors. The cost would be about 6.67% of world GDP.

Annual percent of world GDP spent on the military is about 2%.


So we solve global warming by doubling the number of nuclear plants world wide. We simply cannot prevent global warming without lots of nukes. Safe, clean nukes


Other efforts (solar and wind, afforestation, carbon capture, fertilizing the oceans with irons sulfate, etc. ) can help but they are not nearly as cost effective as expanding nuclear energy.


Nukes can also use off-peak KWh to electrolysize water to create enough hydrogen (without fossil fuel reformatting) to create a hydrogen fuel cell economy that avoids the chief problem with batteries as energy storage. Even the best rechargeable battery wears out over time and will no longer take a charge. Disposing of these batteries will be a major toxic waste disposal problem. So will the disposal of PVCs, which also wear out (current warranties for solar roof top arrays are 10 to 20 years).","2019-12-31 10:39:49","1","[deleted]","1747915434.12819","carbon capture","manual"

Agree, with the obvious caveat that the people watching FOX actively deny it as much as they ignore it.

Jimmy Dore tears apart Ukraine-gate, perhaps the finest example of a ""gaslighting effort"" I've seen in my lifetime. According to the MSM, the star witness dropped ""bombshells,"" planted ""IEDs,""  and  delivered ""blowtorch hot"" testimony, despite the fact that he repeatedly stated  he has NO evidence WHATSOEVER of ANY wrongdoing.  Age of Insanity.
