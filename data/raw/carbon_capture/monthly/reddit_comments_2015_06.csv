Until no one accepts money for goods?  Until the government has been disbanded?  Until electricity is a scarce good?  Or until we are in a near repeat of the great depression?","2015-06-30 04:14:46","6","[deleted]","1747846977.175489","carbon capture","manual"

You just do not know because people do not like to talk about the fact that they got laid off and have to move back to live with their parents or relatives or try to get a cheaper apt in some little town or whatever. Look at all of the people who are on wellfare. They are de facto collapsed. Soon the whole thing will go down the tubes. Give it 100 years or so.","2015-06-30 09:46:06","4","funkarama","1747846977.179671","carbon capture","manual"
"csmqd2c","t3_3biw92","3biw92","collapse","skeptical","I was listening to an interview with Jared Diamond and he said a fast collapse would be a nuclear war obviously and gentler kind of collapse might be the conditions in places like Somalia and Haiti gently, gradually spreading around the world. He said that in this possible collapse scenario, more and more countries all around the world would have a lack of a functioning state government and that 40-50 years from now we'd have a world where most of us would be living under more rural conditions.

WARNING: the rest of that interview is a pretty bad interview that's not worth watching.","2015-06-29 19:52:30","3","Wicksteed","1747846977.1816561","carbon capture","manual"

10,000 years ago there were an estimated 15 million people on earth.  For most of the time between then and now the world population was tiny relative to today.  The population only really started exploding over the last 50 years or so.  Little misleading factoids like this make it harder for me to view your post as credible, which is unfortunate because it seems like you put a lot of work into it.","2015-06-30 05:06:48","2","8footpenguin","1747846977.1908438","carbon capture","manual"
