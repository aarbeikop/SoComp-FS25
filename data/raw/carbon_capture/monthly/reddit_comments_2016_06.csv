The global economy is already remarkably fragile. Year-on-year climate impacts will take their toll and will make the probability of recovery less and less likely. And when the machine finally stops running, it will stop fairly suddenly.

The post-collapse universe will be an interesting one to live in.","2016-06-01 03:43:31","11","mcapello","1747869567.526297","carbon capture","manual"

"d3roehd","t3_4lza8q","4lza8q","collapse","skeptical","You are right, the CO2 already in the atmosphere is too much. Direct air capture will be the only solution. Via machines probably, though possibly with biology. This article explains the possibilities and problems. [Can Sucking CO2 Out of the Atmosphere Really Work?](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531346/can-sucking-co2-out-of-the-atmosphere-really-work/) The direct air capture industry would be the largest in human history larger than oil and gas. Since it doesn't sell a product (other than niche applications for CO2) it would have to be subsided through taxation in the same way taxes pay for pollution cleanup already. This is the only future I see out of the global warming trap, everything else is too small or not sufficient. ","2016-06-01 13:23:24","3","FF00A7","1747869567.5311942","carbon capture","manual"
