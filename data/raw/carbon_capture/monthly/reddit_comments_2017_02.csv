"dddcen5","t3_5s8liz","5s8liz","collapse","skeptical","Yes, collapse is a cultural choice.  However, the biggest problem is our entire society is built on the ""grow or die"" paradigm.  If we don't end unlimited growth, our finite environment will end it for us.

"dddpleg","t3_5s8liz","5s8liz","collapse","skeptical","Your logic has a little flaw. You propose solutions for some of our problems, but the way you worded it makes it seem like you are offering ways for industrial civilization to keep going. Rivers are being polluted in India by big pharma and the only clean ones are sold to Coca-Cola for pennies a litre. Building roads is destroying the ability for ecosystems to maintain their diversity, as habitats are being constantly fragmented. 

The list of other problems is too big as well, and that without considering the moral arguments against capitalism that would make it non desirable for an easy way to solve some of its faults, because it would perpetuate the worst of the human behavior. Where we seem to disagree is that you look at all of this as a cultural choice of sorts, like people are actually aware of all the wonderful choices and possibilities out there, and that we are CHOOSING to die off. 

Your examples about mushrooms are absolutely wonderful when it comes to showcasing what I will say next. How many meat eaters you know are actually aware of the consequences and the impact of the industry on the environment and on our diminishing resources? Granted, younger people might be more aware of things, thanks to the internet, but my parents and their generation, let alone their parents and their generation, believe that meat is basically a gift of god and that as long as they are not thiefs and murderers, they are decent people and deserve to have as much as they can pay for. I am pretty sure most people don't decide to be evil, nor they desire to drive humanity and the planet towards the collapse; in fact I would go out and say that most people find that sort of situation undesirable, yet we are still heading there, so what happened?

You make great points about how societies went on from using psychoactive substances to stimulants, and how people in the American continent kept that tradition alive, which helped create inmensely more sustainable societies. Sadly, Europeans and Asians didn't think that way for too long, and in the end the cancer that is willing to spread will eat any and all available tissue out there. Now you have the epicentre of the ruler and dominator class established in one of the most beautiful and sacred lands of the world. Were people in Europe in favour of enslaving, raping and torturing people for money at the time? I would bet not. In fact, I would argue very strongly that most wars that were fought at any given time, were not supported by the population, and I would like to support this claim with evidence, but I lack the background to confirm it. Yet wars keep being fought, and people are still being enslaved and tortured and raped for profit. Again, what happened?

Rulers. That is what happened. Power equals corruption when it comes to humans. Leaders are, and have been, chosen not to serve, but to rule. I don't know why, and I don't know how, but humans suddenly developed the need to follow someone or something, and the more cunning and even psychopathic ones realized this and took advantage of it. Fast forward a few centuries and you have massive amounts of regulations that inhibit any action, including speech, that opposes the established order, you have nonsensical doctrine that dictates what is virtuous and what is sinful (needless to say that giving all your money to the powerful was and is still seen as a ticke to paradise). Even today, our freedoms are basically limited as to in what way you will contribute to the ravaging of the earth by growing the economy through your job. Most of the substances that get people to be aware of the current charade we pass by as society are forbidden and socially rejected because it would take away all the power from the ruling classes. You have massive misinformation campaigns, you have corporate hitmen killing activists. The same men that give you food, that allow for you to have a house, that have the police and the army in their pockets, that elect who you will vote for and pretend to be free, got there by bullying populations for generations. 

So we as individuals don't have much of a choice, and as I stated and as it was stated, it is not only about CO2 emissions and food grown. The whole industrial complex is what is poisoning and killing the planet and making everyone other than its owners miserable in the process. To get people to understand this is the hardest part, because it means to accept that we are between a rock and a hard place; do we dismantle civilization, kill the elites and go back a few centuries in quality of life, guaranteeing the death of billions, or do we keep going, ignoring everything, and still guarantee the death of billions? The reason capitalism works is because it does in fact exponentially increase the quality of life in those countries that practice it. Why? Because the more you take away from nature, the more you get for yourself. Some ancient cultures were wise enough to diminish their own well being to maintain a long-term balance with the earth, but the other side of the coin also shows famine, drought, plague and death. Are people today (direct descendants of the whole ""unaware predator"" breed of humankind) willing to risk their ill deserved well-being for a fat chance at saving this current age of life? Plus, what is the guarantee that this behaviors would not return? That abolishing the current tyranny would not create tribalism and violence over co-operation and equality? As I said, it baffles me how humans need leaders, and how these leaders tend to look for themselves first, it is a sad paradox. If you read this far, I hope you understand I agree with most of what you say, if not with all of it, it is just that the general meaning was a bit from a historical viewpoint of humanity.

TL;DR. The masses are guilty of giving up control of their lifes to psychopaths that don't care or don't believe their actions will have consequences, and narrow solutions will only help capitalism keep raping the earth for longer periods of time. The only alternative to dismantle civilization at the risk of losing most of the wealth being acquired through it, which in my opinion is not a choice most human beings would be willing to make.","2017-02-06 01:12:33","5","[deleted]","1747878743.690022","carbon capture","manual"

Millions of years of evolution have determined certain characteristics of the human species: our delusional optimism, our inability to empathize with unborn generations and act in their best interests, or desire to keep breeding, our greed that drives us to strip the things we want out of the environment without a care in the world, our supreme confidence in our brainpower, etc. ","2017-02-06 04:25:36","3","[deleted]","1747878743.693883","carbon capture","manual"
"dde85dq","t3_5s8liz","5s8liz","collapse","skeptical","What a refreshingly original take on collapse. Thank you.

A few comments:

If mushrooms, seaweed and shellfish tasted like beef there would be no problem. Nature really should have seen to that. She messed up badly there and must suffer the consequences.

The move from psychoactive substances to brewing up beer, cider and wine is, again, because most folk found them more pleasant and pleasurable. Nature should have sorted that one too.

So far as our consumerist, capitalist societies are concerned, they evolved to be dominant because they were successful. Blame evolution and survival of the fittest for that one. It's not actually a question of cultural choice.

All in all, Nature is to blame I'm afraid. Not us!

"ddegll8","t3_5s8liz","5s8liz","collapse","skeptical","I completely agree that a cultural shift would buy us some time... Unfortunately, entheogenic experiences (induced by outside chemicals or not) are rare and we have no stable integration method (no mythology or ritual to guide people through the experience. Most people in an industrial civilization never get a chance to change in such ways... and those who do usually tend to go new age or introspective.

Some people hope Trump will just go full geoengineering, others hope a cultural shift will happen. But these are just dreams, little different from the techno-optimism we hate. Maybe its not as blind and naive, but it is just as unrealistic.","2017-02-06 15:21:27","1","impactsilence","1747878743.704426","carbon capture","manual"
