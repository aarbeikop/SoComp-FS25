Electricity generation from wind and solar is rapidly becoming cheaper than fossils and nuclear. We need  ways to store and transport this cheaper, cleaner energy. 

Just a few options for energy storage include: hydrogen (H2) from electrolysis of water (NOT from fracked methane), batteries, and pumped hydro. 

Both H2 and batteries can be used in transport, or at a fixed location for electric backup/intermittent use, in conjunction with solar or wind. 

Pumped hydro (pumping water up to a higher elevation reservoir for release when electricity is needed, via hydroelectric generation) is a fixed location solution for energy storage. 

Chemistry, or chemical engineering, would be useful if interested in working on battery chemistry. Not sure an entirely new degree is needed.","2019-06-04 05:30:45","3","huprice","1747909346.026955","carbon capture","manual"

To actually reverse climate change in her lifetime, she'll need to work on negative emissions technologies.  

Perhaps look into the people and organizations involved in http://carbon.ycombinator.com/

> Is a degree in chemical engineering a good first step, or would it be a waste of time?

There are huge diminishing returns after the first degree.  She's proven that she's disciplined enough to graduate from a top tier school.  Now she has to prove that she has the self-motivation to join a start-up.

> What are some companies or organizations where she could work to have an impact? Preference for the SF Bay Area, but not a limiting factor. Startups welcome.

So, negative emissions tech is probably a ways off.  It really has to be funded with a carbon tax of some sort.  Low emissions tech is a bigger opportunity right now.  Better nuclear (small, modular, waste burning, Thorium fueled, etc), better fusion (ITER is never going to produce anything, but there are alternatives), better batteries (better lithium ion, cheap bulk storage that doesn't make your home a toxic waste site, flow batteries), other electricity storage, hot dry geothermal (near infinite energy a half dozen miles down, but we need cheap drilling).  

Better batteries are probably the most reliable way to make  a near future impact.  There is supposed to be tech that increases the energy density of Li Ion batteries 10 fold, and flow batteries should be the cheapest form of electrical energy storage at scale (but currently are not).","2019-06-03 23:24:33","1","technologyisnatural","1747909346.031853","carbon capture","manual"

This isn't a current option for any individual. The technology to accomplish this level of weather control is decades away, maybe centuries.

But individuals can make major contributions to the climate resiliency of their local communities.  

The first step is to identify the main climate risks faced by your local community. Although I actually think it's better to expand your view and consider all *environmental* risks faced by a community. There's no obvious reason to focus on a slow-acting factor like climate; many communities have much more urgent environmental risks to face, and they shouldn't be overlooked at the very start.

This can be a difficult assignment, deciding which local environmental risk is most urgent. My general advice is that if you don't know where to start, then the first place to look is probably local water issues: supply, salinity, drainage, flood control, erosion, sea-level rise. Probably most local communities have *some* sort of addressable challenge somewhere in that field.

So civil and hydrological engineers have a great leg up on this task. When environmental issues start to become urgent in a community, often those are the skills which are most needed.","2019-06-05 04:58:17","1","DocHarford","1747909346.038553","carbon capture","manual"

I think you're missing some bulletpoints on the disruption of the nitrogen cycle, but a timeline for it is really difficult to make. [This study](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html) thinks changes to biogeochemical flows (particularly the amount of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus in our environment) are the ""planetary boundary"" at most risk (at least of the ones that have been quantified). [Here's](https://climateandcapitalism.com/2019/04/18/nitrogen-crisis-a-neglected-threat-earths-life-support-systems/#_edn3) [why] (https://climateandcapitalism.com/2019/04/29/nitrogen-glut-too-much-of-a-good-thing-is-deadly-for-the-biosphere/) that's the case. 

I had some qualms with a few of your bulletpoints, but by and large, this is a great start of a list. Users of this sub seem to have a habit of sometimes freaking out over inconsequential bullshit, perpetuating blatant fear mongering, and making very precise claims about topics (especially exact timelines for particular events) that experts would be, at best, VERY hesitant to make. You seem to have avoided most of the that, but you did make a few claims that I'd be a bit iffy about. Also, calling ~2030-2040 ""The Distant Future"" put me off for a second, because that starts 10.5 years from now. 

I admire your dedication to attempting to spread factual information. To quote you, ""Remember that the internet is not as simple as it used to be, and we as citizens must be prepared to fight misinformation with information."" I think that's critically important right now. 

A majority of people still show the denizens of this sub (and like-minded folks elsewhere) the same disregard and distain that everyone has rightly (for the most part) shown doomsdayers for millennia. Unfortunately for all of us, the circumstances that surround us are truly unique, and we are quickly running out of applicable historical references to aid us in decoding the shitstorm that is our future.

So yeah, shout out to Canadaland from my little corner of southwest Virginia. If you want some help in adding references to any part of your list, I'd be glad to do my part. It'd be next to impossible to get any kind of reputable sources for a lot of the Society bulletpoints, but finding good links for the Nature section seems more doable. It'd be awesome to get multiple good links for each point, especially links to peer-reviewed journals or [relatively unbiased news sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com). 

This legitimately has the possibility of being a damn good sticky for the sub, so I'd love to get something like this crowd-sourced to some degree. Perhaps people could say what (if anything) they are qualified to speak about authoritatively, and we could divy up bulletpoints accordingly. This may require a new thread, but I'll start anyway. 

I have three AAS degrees that qualify me for factory jobs bridging the white collar/blue collar gap, but I'm still quite wet behind the ears (less than half a year total working in any factory environment). I can still speak about the manufacturing sector, at least in broad strokes, to a greater degree of accuracy than the majority of people. I've done a fair bit of personal research on climate change (and all its many sub-issues), aquifer depletion, resource overuse, and more recently, nitrogen cycle disruption.

I already posted this a few days ago but i'll copy paste it here now:  


 

TL:DR We need to increase death rates (No not by mass extermination! hold your horses and read.) And decrease birth rates. We need to move away from livestock food and towards a vegetarian diet or better yet vegan. We need to not only go 100% CO2 zero, but actually carbon negative in a big way. And we need to make radical changes to the way we live and manage this planet, it's resources and our lives. Some ideas I would put forward would be so:

* Legalise abortion
* Legalise euthanasia
* Promote contraception and make it 100% free
* Promote single child families and cease all child benefits for the second+ child, you want more than 1 kid you pay for it yourself!
* Introduce birthing license the same thing as you have for adoption. If you are not capable of adopting a kid, why should be allowed to shit out as many as you like? Not on my watch! bring in the same means testing as adoption
* Kids born without license simply don't gain child benefits. You did it you buy it.
* Push healthy eating education through schools and commence a public push towards veganism if possible.
* Over 10 years or so slowly increase taxation of meat products to make it too expensive to buy, while reducing the amount slaughter houses are able to produce per year, after 10 years phase it out altogether, no more cow, pig, lamb or chicken in your super markets. But don't go cold turkey
* Promote home growing foods, permaculture, sustainable living and lowering our consumption
* Ban all combustion engines. Diesel, petrol, banned. (Phase out over 10 years)
* Only self driving electric cars allowed, but tax them to shit to make them too expensive
* Ban all commercial air travel. (phase out over 5 years) Only military, government and emergency air travel allowed
* Make all public transport nationalised and free to use. Move to electric vehicles only
* Promote people moving closer to work, grant subsidies for housing if it's within certain distance from work and promote walking and cycling
* Phase out all fossil fuel burning power plants, replace with renewables and nuclear as needed.
* As dimming decreases due to phase out of power, industry, agriculture and transport begin carbon capture and storage on a macro-scale. We need to at least match mother nature's positive feedback emissions. This is totally 100% key and we must do this no matter what!
* Use of atmospheric aerosol injections geo engineering as needed to compensate for loss of dimming
* Promote abandoning villages and towns that are no longer necessary and aid nature in reclaiming this stolen land by removing harmful or toxic materials and planting trees and plants to aid these areas being reclaimed by nature
* Cease destroying rainforests, make it life imprisonable offence to do so, the same for dumping waste at sea
* Economic overhaul. Single world currency. Wealth caps on individuals and on corporations. Nobody can become mega rich any more, no more need for greed, no care about GDP and growth is frowned upon.

**Conclusion:**

Due to policy people who wish to abort or die gracefully can, death rate will increase. Due to policy birth rate will radically drop. The world's population will start to fall, this will be closely monitored by our imaginary control body. Policy can be changed as needed to stabilise the population at safe manageable level over however long that takes.

​

As population decreases so to does the global consumption levels. The need for industry and power decreases and it becomes easier to control the many different aspects of running the planet and maintaining equilibrium with our environment. As we no longer need all the dwellings, towns, villages, even possibly cities, these places are striped of useful metals and materials, and left to be reclaimed by nature. Aiding wildlife comeback and creating rather than destroying ecosystems and new carbon sinks.

As population and everything that comes with is diminishes so will our dimming effect. The world will actually heat faster. We need to scale CCS and geo engineering with this decline to match it in a delicate balance to slowly and carefully bring heating levels down and get a grasp on atmospheric management. We must become the master of our environment and we must become responsible for what we do to it. No longer shall we just do what we like without giving a shit. We check ourselves, we maintain balances and equilibriums and we live within our means.

For all of this to work, every single nation on Earth MUST unite under 1 flag and rule. No more greed, no more wars, no more borders, no more excuses to kill one another, it's all or nothing. Every country rich and poor must become equal and take equal measures globally.  
ALL humans have to work together for once. Not a world war two Manhattan Project effort, a GLOBAL save the fucking planet effort.

Ideal we needed to do these things around 1970-80. But with extreme strict management now we can still possibly pull this planet back from the brink, it's just going to be a LOT harder with 8 billion people than with 3.4billion There is more to manage and more shit needs to be built, decommissioned and so on. But I personally can't see any other way to survive beyond the magical 2100 mark. Certainly if we do nothing, like we are now, the result is extinction.

Start by eliminating fossil fuel travel and restructuring human habitat to work in smaller communities that can start exploring self sustainable lifestyles and gardening projects. 

Distribution of goods would be the only accepted long distance travel. Meanwhile this buys time for people to refocus their energy in local ways without immediately losing access to electricity and internet. 

Next electrical use can be phased out as decentralized alternatives are developed. 

People really need to embody the phrase ""think global, act local."" More than ever we have an expectancy of being able to easily commute beyond the distance our feet can carry us. Now is the time to re-educate ourselves on how we can live and sustain ourselves in a greatly reduced area of influence. For many this means relocating to more rural areas while there is still opportunity to do so. 

In the mean time, weather may worsen and crop yields may be very limited. 

This may seem drastic to some, but the alternative is riding out the wave until it crashes hard. What to do when there isn't time to learn how to garden and when all your neighbors simply form a destructive mob? So also a good time to nurture friendship and problem solving skills. NVC is going to be very important. 

People's big problems today include things like managing hypoglycemia. This isn't even a disease, but a first world ego issue related to people trying to do too much. But the effect is literally a lot of people who get angry when they don't have food. Similar to how denial is the first stage of withdrawal. If we don't phase things out realistically and plan time for people to adjust and recover from their first world issues, the whole thing just blows up. But already people are so brittle that you probably won't hear much on TV about any of this, as what can they say that won't create overreactions in a people who have been conditioned to live in fear? 

The answer to fear is trust and confidence, and not needing to pay it mind. 

So realistically? Move to a commune and learn to live off the land voluntarily and then do your best to help your new community survive the bands of mobs that will come when shtf. Being mobile instead of fixed is likely the only way, as people will be drawn to any source of food that others are cultivating. 

Meanwhile hope and pray that all will be well and that our governments won't employ WoMD, and that climate change will allow enough life to survive for some humans to survive too. 

Also, meditate and develop your spirituality. You may find answers in spirit that are much more aware of what is going on and why than your thinking mind could possibly fathom. This has been planned out and has been coming for a while. Lesson for recovery is all about working together in harmony and letting go of ego, entitlement, greed, control, and human design. Working with the design of nature will take us much further than human design could ever. See what happens when we take things too far?

We would then subsequently have to plant an additional 1.2 trillion trees every 10 years to offset additional CO2 emissions.

2) Immediately launch a global effort to rapidly genetically engineer phytoplankton that reproduced at a rate much higher than they currently do and then deploy cultures and fuel for the cultures of these super-phytoplankton to every corner of the world's oceans. This is an approach that takes on a lot more risk, because we don't know what would happen to the global ecosystem once their populations were truly out of human control, but it would significantly reduce CO2 emissions and would potentially work much faster than planting trees.

That means:

1) When you're in a hole, stop digging. Invest massively in non-carbon energy sources. That means nuclear (though that's not a permanent solution, due to limited fuel quantities), solar, and geothermal. If there are any viable rivers  that haven't been dammed for hydropower, dam them.  It means reducing emissions for transportation by investing massively in public transit, including in places which aren't using a lot of cars yet (so that demand doesn't rise). Invest in cleaner technologies for commercial shipping. Heck, we could throw some more money at fusion, too. 

2) Some sources of emissions need to be simply reduced outright. Severely limit air travel. Severely limit cattle-farming and flooded-field rice production. Et cetera.

3) Invest massively in carbon capture. No, it's not magic. No, it won't prevent massive disruption to the climate system. No, it's not going to make it safe to emit as much as we want without changing the system massively. But it's *part* of the road to a less-bad future, and we need it.

4) Change the world economic system so that it doesn't require endlessly-increasing emissions in order to not implode and ruin everyone's lives. Put natural resources under collective control, so that they aren't plundered to enrich a small number of assholes. Crush the concentrations of private power that lobby for the endless destruction of the Earth for their own benefit. End the channelling by the elite of massive amounts of resources into unproductive and actively destructive endeavours. Make sure that the coming disasters don't shake down the world's wealth into a shrinking number of hands. Talking of growth - the dangers of population growth are vastly exaggerated by fascists, but there are certain kinds of problems that can be partially mitigated by slower rates of growth. Make education and birth control and abortion available to all who want them, and accelerate the demographic transitions that countries are going to go through anyway.

5) Try to mitigate the impacts of the disasters that are ""locked in"". Prepare to help people in the most-impacted countries get the fuck out of there. There are going to be massive numbers of refugees whatever we do - make sure that they don't suffer and die. Prepare to relieve people hit by floods and heat waves and horrendous storms. Again, this involves a lot of redistribution of wealth. Invest in engineering crops that can survive in the shittier conditions of tomorrow, and make sure that agribusiness can't extort farmers with the intellectual property rights to them.

If it gets bad, we'll just do that. NBD. Small exerpt from the article. It would work. The science is solid. This isn't fantasy tech, it is just a man man supervolcano that is always on. 


""Wood's talk didn't generate much enthusiasm among the scientists in Aspen that day. ""I thought it would never work,"" Caldeira says. In fact, he teamed up with another Livermore colleague, Bala Govindasamy, to prove Wood wrong by conducting a thorough climate simulation, the first of its kind. ""The intent was to put an end to all the geoengineering talk,"" Caldeira says. Because changes in the intensity of sunlight affect the climate quite differently than do changes in greenhouse gas concentrations — sunlight varies by season and by the diurnal cycle and falls most strongly over the tropics and equator, whereas carbon dioxide traps heat both day and night across the globe — he had a hunch that the two might not really offset one another very well, especially on a regional or seasonal basis.

When the results came back, Caldeira had disproved his own hypothesis. Geoengineering really did seem to operate more or less like a planetwide thermostat. As the resulting paper noted, Wood's proposal might have any number of adverse environmental and ecological consequences, but it also might offer real benefits. ""Melting of Greenland and Antarctic ice caps and the consequent sea level rise,"" Caldeira and Govindasamy wrote in the spring 2000 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, ""is less likely to occur in a geoengineered world.""

The paper helped propel Wood's idea into the scientific mainstream and turned Caldeira and Wood into unlikely new allies. Since then, increasingly bad climate news has only heightened interest in the proposal. The summer of 2007 saw a new low in the extent of Arctic sea ice, while data from the Greenland ice sheet is similarly ominous; if it were to melt entirely, sea levels would rise 20 feet, submerging coastal cities like New York and Shanghai. Meanwhile, a new climate-modeling study by Caldeira and another colleague found that in order to stabilize the climate now, we'd have to go to zero emissions almost immediately — something nobody thinks is even remotely possible. All of which is forcing scientists to consider geoengineering more seriously as a way to fight climate change.

There's no better evidence for the growing acceptance of geoengineering than a 2006 essay in the journal Climatic Change by the atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen, who shares a 1995 Nobel Prize for work on ozone formation and decomposition. The continuing failure of governments to move on global warming, Crutzen says, makes open discussion of geoengineering essential. ""The very best would be if emissions of the greenhouse gases could be reduced so much that the stratospheric sulfur release experiment would not take place,"" he wrote. ""Currently, this looks like a pious wish.""

The stratospheric sulfate experiment has already had its proof of concept — courtesy of planet Earth. On June 15, 1991, Mount Pinatubo, which for months had been rumbling, belching, and terrorizing the main Philippine island of Luzon, finally blew its top in an explosion so powerful that it carried 500 feet of the mountain's peak along with it. It was the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, 10 times the size of the Mount Saint Helens explosion in 1980 and the first of its scale to occur with modern scientific technologies in place — especially satellites — to measure the global environmental and climatic effect.

Pinatubo's eruption didn't just unleash huge mud slides and lava flows; it also fired an ash stream 22 miles into the air, injecting 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. Over the following months, a massive haze gradually dispersed across the globe. Meanwhile, the sulfur dioxide component underwent chemical reactions to form a particulate known as sulfate aerosol (in essence, droplets of water and sulfuric acid), which absorbs sunlight and reflects some of it back into space.""","2019-06-06 21:30:28","3","russianpotato","1747909875.8400571","carbon capture","manual"

There were 60-70 media companies in Reagan's, we're now down to fewer than 5-6 megaconglomerates.  This only ensures handpicked candidates to win (and is much of the reason Trump rose as the anticandidate from the antimedia).

Furthermore, we perhaps have to democratize the airwaves.  Back in the 1920s or so, we sold these monopolies to radio waves (the frequencies radio stations are on) and when TV emerged, much the same to the same companies at the time (ABC, CBS, NBC).  With digital tech, we need to take back what is a common property and divvy it up more fairly somehow.  I'm not a big believer in government produced programming (PBS) but I am of a regulated free market.

There's a lot more problems to our Republican form of Democracy, but we won't fix this without addressing and removing the corptocracy we have in place these days.  There is no way forward without doing that.

After that, we need more than a carbon tax.  The whole problem with industry is the tragedy of the commons.  The profits get privatized while the losses get socialized.  2008-9 is a perfect example of that.  There is no ying and yang.  When a car company produces a car, it doesn't have to plant 1000 trees to offset the damage that engine alone is going to do.  Same with a dryer or many gadgets.

And it grows bigger.  100 years ago, a coke or beer bottle of glass got tossed, conceivably the glass could be recycled and made into another one.  Perpetual reusability.  Plastic not so much, but the industries making these never have to confront these problems, hence they will never stop.

150 years ago, when a toy maker made something, it was going to be out of wood most likely, maybe a bit of iron wire, whatever.  And if the kid tossed it, it would rot away, so what?  Cycle of nature.

We need industry to factor end-of-life on their product and putting a deposit on it just like do (or used to do) with bottles in Germany.  Buy product, pay sizable deposit, bring it back when empty, store recycles.

This goes for home depots and fluorescent tubes, drying machines, etc.

Energy at home needs to follow a steep curve upward.  The first 200 khw OR WHATEVER are cheap per house, dwelling or business.  Then it trends steeply upward.  Discourage waste by costing money.  That's the only way people change.

And sorry to say it, we slowly have to make it way too expensive for people to stay in suburbs.  We just cannot have a car culture at this time, even electric with all the strip mining.  This will be the most painful part for people to give up.

There are many more changes, perhaps persue Taylor Wilson's nuclear vision while sticking everything into a fusion research programs, etc.

The thing is, like heroine addicts, a few people might vote for these changes but the mass majority will stick with their lifestyle until we hit rock bottom.  Compromised democracy or not.  We're never going to get there.

The only real chance of success is to recognize that we have a problem -- many people, 1 spaceship called earth, and everyone's fighting to control the rudder or raid the ship's stores.  We need multiple spaceships so if one wants to kamikaze, it won't take the rest of us out with it.  We don't have enough time to develop that tech.

As climate gets worse and worse slowly everbody will notice its something real and not a hoax affecting all of us. 

But we slowly get into fixing this, climate will be so worse (as it starts now), that we need to focus on helping a dieing world, giving us less resources to face climate change. And so most humans will die, only a few living will survive, but without the current system the have to survive like in the medieval ages.","2019-06-07 11:19:11","1","Urukking","1747909875.86884","carbon capture","manual"
