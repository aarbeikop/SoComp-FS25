But with so many studies saying that there aren't enough resources to go around, humans can't undo changes they've made at this point, carbon capture is still years away etc. is there reason for hope? Do we really have a chance or should I just pack up shop and set up a  bunker. I'm sorry if this sounds like a joke but honestly I don't know what to do. This shit has me so worried it consumes almost every thought I have. How do you all cope?","2018-10-29 13:07:51","25","38","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9scwyx/should_i_stay_optimistic/","True","Pretty_Much_A_Shrub","1747899982.554879","carbon capture","manual"
