The professor who helped make the game agreed himself, that those were bugs, and that it was a fix. The guy who made it seem so hard realized he hadn't factored everything in once it was released. After he played it a few times, he agreed that cards needed to give more info, there were multiple positive feedback loops that were ignored, and that the negative ones weren't as extreme.

For instance: There is NO way we are going to run out of nuclear fuel(and fission fuel) in the near future... The original game gave you what, 20? 40 years tops of nuclear fuel... makes NO sense.

Also, there are plenty of people who have beaten the ORIGINAL game, even with the bugs and incorrect data AND kept the total temp below 1 increase.

TL;DR- The professor who was involved in the game screwed up, and admitted to it. The patches to make it ""easier"" were just fixes to make it more realistic...","2016-03-21 19:09:40","129","kowaletm","1747865188.662164","carbon capture","manual"

"d181419","t3_4bc6tp","4bc6tp","collapse","skeptical","I think the reason you can't really win, is because a 2.5°C rise by 2011 is already *baked in*. And of course beyond 2100, it keeps rising and rising and likely won't change for a few thousand years at the least.

If there were a total economic collapse, power plants would still run (by government fiat, if necessary). Deforestation would probably pick up.

There is a chance we won't go into a runaway greenhouse planet - Earth had plant and animal life when carbon was in the thousands parts per million. But numerous species will die and much of humanity will, too.

We have the technology to move richer countries (e.g. Denmark, Australia, Germany) off CO2, but poorer countries will not want to do it. 

Oil dependent poorer countries, HAVE TO SELL OIL or else their society collapses (Syria!). They will sell the oil at any price (above extraction cost). 

Also, there are upper-middle-income countries, who say that oil/coal is their national treasure and they will keep on using it for themselves and will actively DENY that CO2 emissions have any global impact (e.g. Poland, Russia).
