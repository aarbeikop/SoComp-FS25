"8oidjq","collapse","skeptical","A rare moment of ""hope"" from Reddit: r/worldnews Redditors are discussing catastrophic, abrupt climate change, and no one is even pretending we can fix it.","Being a regular reader of this subreddit, it's pretty common that I see a bad news about climate post at the top of my homepage. Imagine my surprise when I saw that, today, it was an article shared on r/worldnews with an upvote score of over 25.0k.

The best and most surprising part here is the comment. ALL of the top comments sounded like they could've been written here. No false hope about Magic Wand carbon capture tech. No ""we can tough it out if we put our heads together!"" The consensus was pretty decidedly: ""We're fucked, we've fucked things up beyond return, humanity will never be the same.""

""Hope"" might not be the right word, but it does give me some encouragement to see that we're not the only ones that see what's going on.","2018-06-04 15:56:06","344","124","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/8oidjq/a_rare_moment_of_hope_from_reddit_rworldnews/","True","grandeuse","1747896754.617516","carbon capture","manual"
