Each generation is more technologically capable.  Technology can change relationships that seem damning today - relationships between population and emissions, between GDP and emissions, etc.  Technology can help us adapt so that damage from climate change is lower, and can outright halt global warming using geoengineering if necessary.  Imagine the technological changes over the past 100 years.  The changes over the next 100 years are only going to be greater.  Almost every alarmist screed imagines a world where technology freezes in place and nothing is ever invented again.  Most mainstream accounting for climate damages does the same (by using non-standard values for the discount rate).  It just isn’t realistic.

Global GDP for 2018 was around  **$87.51 trillion,** and carbon capture tech currently costs between **$49/ton** if captured at the source, to **$168/ton** for direct air capture.  


Emissions for 2018 were around **37.1 billion** tons, with natural processes soaking around 10 of that.  So the cost of carbon capture at the high end is **$4.5 trillion** to negate our emissions, and only **$2.05 trillion** to run the carbon capture tech to meet the IPCC guideline of 45% reductions.  


Now granted this doesn't include the cost to build the carbon capture infrastructure, but there is a military incentive to do so.  As whoever does will effectively control the thermostat for the planet and can turn the temp up or down as best suits their national needs.

If we dramatically cut back our CO2 dumping we could stabilize atmospheric CO2 at below 2C.

That requires steep reduction in energy use starting today, something upwards of 10-15% per year from now going forward. 

If we don't do this, then anything over the 2C carbon budget, about 5-700 gigatons of CO2, would have to be removed. This is predicated on no unpleasant surprises from the earth-climate system.

If we fail to stop emissions, I don't think it is likely we will be able to remove enough CO2 to stay under 2C.

Your line of reasoning reminds me a little bit of the economic fallacy where you can create economic growth by breaking windows. If you break a window, you create work for the window makers. So why not break all the windows and get the economy going? Well, because those repairs actually take up energy that could've been used elsewhere. Carbon sequestration is environmental cleanup, it's garbage collection.

Actually I don't say it can't be scaled or that it's too expensive, I ask CAN IT be scaled, or how much will it use - not cost, that's really not the factor, if it has to use more energy than we have or energy sources that do their own pollution, then it's a null. If it cannot be scaled, then frankly it's not going to solve anything. Perhaps one day I'll be shown a process and ask the same questions and get something positive.
