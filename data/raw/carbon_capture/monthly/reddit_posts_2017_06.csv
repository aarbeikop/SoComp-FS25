"6isyum","science","scientific","American Geophysical Union AMA: Hi Reddit, I'm Piers Forster, I am here to talk about what caused past global warming and what will happen in the future. I am currently Chair of Climate Physics and Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate, University of Leeds, UK. Ask Me Anything!","I'm Piers Forster and I principally research causes of past climate change and how well we can predict future climate change. I can take Qs on the evidence base for human-induced global warming and how much we should trust our climate model predictions of possible futures, including uncertainty in climate sensitivity – the Earth’s response to a doubling of carbon dioxide – one of the biggest uncertainties in climate science. I also lead an interdisciplinary centre looking at climate solutions, and I would welcome a discussion of ideas on possible solutions. Does solar geoengineering or large-scale carbon capture and storage have legs? Where should we concentrate research effort? Any whacky ideas we should look into?

**I’ll be back at 11am EDT to answer your questions. Ask Me Anything!**
