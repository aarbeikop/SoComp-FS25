"55db48","collapse","skeptical","A fungal dominated planet","Between 420 and 370 million years ago, the Earth's land surface was dominated by enormous mushrooms known as Prototaxites. Back then, the sun was less bright and the Earth's atmospheric CO2 concentrations ranged around 3000 parts per million.

Fungi can form lichens, symbiotic organisms composed of fungi and either cyanobacteria or algae. These Cyanobacteria and algae have a form of the Rubisco enzyme that is faster at capturing carbon dioxide, but makes more errors, in which it grabs oxygen instead of CO2. These enzymes were competitive in higher CO2 environments, but now struggle to compete with plants except in some niches.

Another problem fungi have in today's environment is that they are sensitive to direct sunlight. Plants on the other hand, are mostly sensitive to high temperatures. What plants thus do when temperatures rise too high is to release biogenic volatile organic compounds. These compounds serve to increase the formation of clouds. These clouds then block sunlight and reduce temperatures, which aids the plant, but also has the side-effect of aiding fungi that would normally be decimated by exposure to bright light.

Fungi also suffer from low temperatures at night. High CO2 functions like a blanket, that keeps temperatures higher during the night. As a result, the variation in temperatures between day and night is becoming lower. This is thought to play a role in the global spread of amphibian chytridiomycosis. But I think there is more to this picture than people want to see.

Biology 101 tells you that Fungi take in oxygen and emit carbon dioxide, while plants take in carbon dioxide and emit oxygen. This is correct, but it would be a mistake to assume this means that fungi don't use carbon dioxide themselves. It has been found that carbon dioxide is an important molecule that candida uses to [communicate between different cells](
http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001193). In addition, fungi have an enzyme known as carbonic anhydrase, which is essential for fungi to turn CO2 into bicarbonate, which is used to meet metabolic demands.

Under low concentrations of CO2, the candida fungi uses the CO2 that it produces itself to meet their own metabolic demand for CO2. Under higher concentrations, extra CO2 is used to communicate with other cells and begin their invasion of the skin. It's found with other species of fungi that grow on our skin that [higher CO2 concentrations help fungi to thrive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8938862).

Similarly, it has been found that the Chytrid fungi, one species of which is responsible for the decimation of amphibian populations around the world, [increase in abundance in the soil upon exposure to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.](http://aem.asm.org/content/80/23/7364/F4.expansion.html) Another fungi that infects humans, Cryptococcus neoformans, [is also known to depend on carbon dioxide for many metabolic functions.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16400172)

It's commonly argued that high CO2 concentrations are toxic to fungi, but this seems to be solely the result of the acidification caused by carbon dioxide. Studies that take this into account tend to find that [fungi perform much better in the presence of higher concentrations of carbon dioxide.](https://books.google.nl/books?id=lBYWQaKzrFkC&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=bicarbonate+fungal+metabolic&source=bl&ots=cNoa7tU2gB&sig=d_oA56UOqF0ty1Nxo9guZGRB1hk&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI16CP3LnPAhVKBcAKHRutB6UQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&q=bicarbonate%20fungal%20metabolic&f=false) Fungi are found to be capable of using carbon dioxide to produce all sorts of amino acids that are useful for when nitrogen in their environment is limited.

Here's a question I'd like you to ask yourself: Given the fact that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising at the fastest rate in hundreds of millions of years, could it be that species around the world are being decimated by fungal infections because these fungi can now thrive better thanks to all of this carbon dioxide in the environment? Bats are dying from white nose syndrome, amphibians are dying from Chytridiomycosis. People suspect a link to climate change, but I haven't heard yet of anyone bothering to investigate the direct physiological role that elevated carbon dioxide concentrations could be having.

Perhaps more important to understand is the fact that the fungi don't just colonize our animal skin. Fungi are an important parasitic burden for plants as well. Plants are protected against fungal epidemics primarily through genetic diversity, which is exactly what we lose as a result of agriculture and the widespread use of genetically modified crops. So far we manage to keep most of these fungi under control through use of pesticides, but the number of pesticides that work against fungi are very limited and many are used in medicine too, where fungi are rapidly growing resistant.

Keep in mind that fungi are generally very poorly preserved in the fossil record. They thrive under conditions that don't favor fossil preservation and have delicate bodies that are not preserved well. My suggestion would be as following: Keep an eye on the fungus.","2016-10-01 14:01:06","41","27","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/55db48/a_fungal_dominated_planet/","True","-triggerexpert-","1747874675.6580741","carbon capture","manual"
