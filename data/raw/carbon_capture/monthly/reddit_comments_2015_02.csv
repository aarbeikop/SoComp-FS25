"cowme2k","t3_2x3sja","2x3sja","science","scientific","Hi.

Even if CO2 capture is adopted by everyone, to the extent that recycling is currently, what effect would is have on global CO2 emissions?

Using UK data (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling_in_the_United_Kingdom), 44% of households recycle their waste (http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/18/recycling-rates-in-england-have-stalled). 

Using those rates, and the fact that only 30% of energy use goes to households (http://www.goodenergy.co.uk/customer-care/help-and-advice/save-energy/what-s-my-impact/household-level), we can expect a reduction of 13% in CO2 emissions.

This figure would be lower in countries like the US or China.

In my opinion, targeting the industrial sector would be much more beneficial. They put out most of the CO2, and have the resources to spend on carbon capture.

How would your technique be useful in this sector, compared to curent methods of carbon emissions reduction?","2015-02-25 12:53:36","11","krakonfour","1747839703.143331","carbon capture","manual"

Also, MEA is pretty much the worst amine out there for carbon capture, what do you see as the downsides of AMP/PIP or MDEA/PIP systems?

Edit: A little background info for those less familiar with the field.

MEA = monoethanolamine, MDEA = methyldiethanolamine, AMP = 2-amino-2-methylpropanol, PIP = piperazine

MEA is the incumbent technology that has historically been used, it's not really good, but cheap.  It degrades with heat, and corrodes steel vessels.

MDEA/PIP is the technology that is replacing it, it's a tertiary amine that uses less energy to regenerate, piperazine is a catalytic activator to make the kinetics faster.

AMP is a hindered primary amine and is a nice choice because it is a non-VOC and is much more robust to chemical degradation due to the amine being bonded to a tertiary carbon center (none of those pesky alpha-carbon protons to remove by free radical abstraction.)

PIP is a small cyclic amine that has fast reactivity rates with CO2, but the ability to hold it isn't good.  The combination with a stoichiometric amine to hold the CO2 before regeneration is nice.  It also has a pretty reasonable tox profile, it's dewormer that we give to pets (and historically, children.)","2015-02-25 13:20:29","9","nallen","1747839703.145729","carbon capture","manual"

But, in order to get the carbonate to start with, you need to invest a large amount of energy, either in mining carbonate minerals directly, or by mining alkaline minerals to convert CO2, or some other analogous process.

What are your thoughts on the source of this energy for carbon capture? Will it take retrofitting on FF power plants, raising their operation costs? Will it take renewable power built specifically to drive CCS? Something else?

Also, I assume your process works by neutralizing the carbonic acid formed by CO2, thus producing bicarbonate instead.

Take this with a grain of salt as I have little scientific knowledge, but my final project at Community College went as follows: 





Burn bio mass ([Short Rotation Woody Crops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_rotation_coppice) was what I used in my project), capture the carbon from that combustion, then use that CO2 as a aid in a greenhouse that is powered and heated (Canadian) by the burning of the biomass. 




In my mind you are capturing carbon with the growth of bio mass, then releasing it with the combustion to produce power, capturing it again (this is where your expertise comes in) and using it to grow vegetables. So you are in-taking CO2 and exhausting locally grown vegetables and carbon *negative* energy. Not to mention the benefits of the  strategically grown Short Rotation Woody Crops (that was the base of my project, I could go on all day about how they could benefit society)





My question to you is regarding capturing the carbon after combustion. Once the carbon is captured in the media is it able to be removed and stored in a gaseous form that could be introduced into the greenhouse? ","2015-02-25 17:19:46","3","oilrocket","1747839703.166692","carbon capture","manual"

This is merely 4.6 times more that the current US daily oil production.  So for CCS to be a viable carbon mitigation strategy  (for coal only) we would require infrastructure 4.6 times greater than the current oil extraction industry to transport liquified CO2 for geologic sequestration.  Not to mention it would make existing coal facilities 20% less efficient.  

How is this a viable approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions?

Researchers at University of California, Berkeley have been studying compost's sequestration properties for the last ten years. The San Francisco Chronicle published the below article on their research last fall. 
http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/A-sprinkle-of-compost-helps-rangeland-lock-up-5832244.php 

Highlights from the article below.

""The research showed that if compost from green waste — everything from household food scraps to dairy manure — were applied over just 5 percent of the state’s grazing lands, the soil could capture a year’s worth of greenhouse gas emissions from California’s farm and forestry industries

-The effect is cumulative, meaning the soil keeps absorbing carbon dioxide even after just one application of compost, the researchers found. In theory, Silver calculates, if compost made from the state’s green waste were applied to a quarter of the state’s rangeland, the soil could absorb three-quarters of California’s greenhouse gas emissions for one year, due in large part to the one-time offset from waste diversion

-Unlike high-tech geo-engineering schemes to pull excess carbon dioxide from the air and stick it in old coal mines or under the ocean, applying compost is a simple way of creating what scientists call a positive feedback loop.

-The good news is that by returning carbon to the soil in a stable form such as compost, soils can be restored, said Rattan Lal, director of the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center at Ohio State University.

Efforts are under way to incorporate soil carbon offsets in California’s cap-and-trade system, so ranchers could earn credits for spreading compost. The American Carbon Registry, an organization that certifies offsets, on Thursday approved one for compost additions to rangeland.""

My final say

-Instead of investing in high tech carbon storage techniques we should be investing in municipal waste diversion programs that keep compostables out of the landfill and create compost for our farms and rangelands, increasing the quality of the soil and sequestering carbon. Additionally when compostables (food scraps, yard waste, food soiled paper) go to the land fill instead of being sent to a composting facility they break down anaerobically, producing methane which according to the EPA is 28x more potent than C02.
