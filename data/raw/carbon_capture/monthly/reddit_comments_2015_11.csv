IMO it's probably not going to get to ww3, but we are in for large waves of migration from tropical regions into industrialized nations. Which is going to freak them out and lead to the rise of fascism. The European ""refugee crisis"" is pretty much how it's going to go except on a far larger scale. 

When you get a bunch of scared fascists running the government bad for things are going to happen, obviously for the refugees, but really for everyone. I expect major atrocities committed against the refugees, loss of all kinds of rights for everyone, and probably proxy wars, but I don't think it is ever going to get to the point of the world powers actually shooting at each other simply because nuclear nations just don't do that (India and Pakistan being a special case.)","2015-11-05 13:39:07","7","whatabear","1747855084.1642501","carbon capture","manual"
