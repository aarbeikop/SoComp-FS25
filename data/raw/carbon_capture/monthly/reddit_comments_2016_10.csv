"d89r44m","t3_55db48","55db48","collapse","skeptical","Interestingly, they've just identified the cause of Crohn's disease to be the interaction between [a fungus and two common gut bacteria](http://www.livescience.com/56334-gut-fungus-suspected-in-crohns-disease.html). What they don't know is what environmental factor causes them to start misbehaving; they're all present in everyone's guts.

I did some research a while back into the correlation between inflammatory bowel diseases and atmospheric carbon dioxide. I found that there's wide consensus that IBD is an [industrial disease](http://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-230X-12-51).

I even wrote a [paranoid rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/3hojrt/crackpot_hypothesis_elevated_levels_of_co2_cause/?st=itrgs0oo&sh=57b47737) about it over on the Crohn's Disease forum.

So yeah... interesting.","2016-10-01 17:22:49","13","MrVisible","1747874677.113993","carbon capture","manual"
"d89obhm","t3_55db48","55db48","collapse","skeptical","That's some excellent reasoning. The amphibian fungus, though, is more to do with encountering a new fungus for the first time after being imported from Africa in the 1950s from ""pee frogs"". (Do you know the story? It's amazing! And sad.) The bat fungus is a mystery, but yours is as good of a theory as any I've heard. ","2016-10-01 16:10:46","11","thoughtsy","1747874677.115349","carbon capture","manual"

"d8bfizo","t3_55db48","55db48","collapse","skeptical","Fungi are mysterious and powerful organisms. They can sate hunger (and are 30 percent protein by dry weight) or they can kill. Some inhibit the growth of cancers, some can remediate land poisoned by industrial toxins, some can bring you face to face with the gods. Because they show up after storms, the ancient Greeks believed they were the mark of Zeus' lightning and the medieval English thought they were the domain the fairies. You can cultivate the delicious oyster mushroom on waste cardboard and you haven't lived until you've tasted a morel. They are also beautiful.  Sadly, a warming climate has also has meant a drier climate in my part of the world, and the joy I get hunting and observing mushrooms has been sorely limited by a drought this year.

Most importantly though, fungi are one of nature's best examples of mutualism and complex cooperative action. Fungi like lichen, as the original post points out, have actually evolved symbiotically, and are actually organisms composed of multiple species--fungi that effectively farm the sugars created by photosynthetic bacteria. The mycelia mats of many other fungal systems are the corner stones of mature and healthy forests and they facilitate  altruistic exchanges of water, sugar and other nutrients across a tree species lines. Fungus also redeem dead organic matter. Silently and selflessly, they work to propagate life where there is only death. 

Given our culture of death, one that finds it easier to imagine the total destruction of the natural world than the end of industrial capitalism, we could do worse than learn from organisms that cooperate with each other and other forms of life, that thrive in ruins, wring vitality from decay, and are useful, selfless, and wonder producing.

Keep an eye on the fungus, indeed. ","2016-10-02 23:25:19","3","[deleted]","1747874677.120599","carbon capture","manual"
