"ctxwg7d","t3_3gge6v","3gge6v","science","scientific","1) How seriously are the national academies considering research into solar radiation management?  And what do you expect the research outlay will be in technology vs political/social science and governance concerns about SRM?
The reason I ask is that the concerns of a rouge state or individual using SRM for personal benefits at the expense of others seems high, and is more of a problem than specific technologies.  E.g., the ""cure is worse than the disease"" argument.  To be clear, I'm specifically asking about research on how governments will likely use SRM, not the governance of the research itself.

2) What top 1-2 impacts of climate change are YOU most concerned about?  What top 1-2 impacts of climate change are YOUR FUNDERS most concerned about? Are they different, if so, why?

3) If you had to make an estimate comparing a metric ton of ghg emissions to a health metric, disability-adjusted live years or something like that, what would you deem necessary for that calculation?

4) Lots of science is justified by working on specific macro-problems that are aggregations of smaller problems or research.  For example, ""climate change"" can justify any research from drought-stress crops to finely measuring gases in ice cores.  ""ocean health"" can be used to justify anything from the acoustic environment for cetaceans to photodegradations of plastics.  You've probably seen a lot of research tagged with the ""for climate"" label recently because that where a lot of the money is.  What ""tag"" did your research follow before this?

Cowspiracy is a documentary highlighting the massive environmental problem animal agriculture is.

It seem a big part of the solution ,  is to provide  plant-based food for all communities in a efficient manner and stop subsidizing factory farming, and  create jobs growing food everywhere possible. Plant trees where crops are now subsidized to be grown to feed these farmed animals. Restore our planet back to its natural state because the balance is lost due to humanities selfish and barbaric behavior. We are not living within the laws of nature. Consuming flesh, stealing milk from babies, caging animals etc , is barbaric, subsidizing it is insane. Our reliance on animals as food needs to stop and a massive movement to grow plants within the laws of nature needs to happen now.  Are you aware of the massive environmental problem Animal Agriculture is and the effect it is having?

When was the last time the arctic had an ice free summer?
