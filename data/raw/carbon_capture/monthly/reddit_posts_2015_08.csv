I’m Scott Doney, a Senior Scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. My research focuses on how the global carbon cycle and ocean ecology respond to natural and human-driven climate change.  

I’m Waleed Abdalati, Director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at CU-Boulder’s Geography Department. My research focuses on the use of satellites and aircraft to understand how Earth's ice cover, particularly glaciers and ice sheets, is changing and what those changes mean for life on Earth.

We’re talking about risks and possibilities of climate intervention, or as it is often referred to, geoengineering.  Ask us anything!

**We will be back at 1 pm ET to answer your questions, ask us anything!**

We're signing out now. Thanks for these great questions and discussion.
