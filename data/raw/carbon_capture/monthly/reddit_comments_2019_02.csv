"eggt24g","t3_aql3u0","aql3u0","climatechange","action-oriented","The short answer is that saying is easier than doing.

The longer answer is that there are multiple ongoing attempts to develop technology to filter out and capture carbon from the air, but there are issues that need to be overcome with how to do so, and then how to do so at scale (since we need to remove literal millions of tonnes from the air), and then how to do so economically (ie. how do we make this financially sustainable, ideally on a self-sustaining basis).

"eggu64j","t3_aql3u0","aql3u0","climatechange","action-oriented","2017 saw approx. 45billion tons of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. That volume of gas needs a lot of infrastructure to capture and process the gas or inject underground. That infrastructure's construction and operation will emit CO2 and scaling such a large project is not feasible for individual companies or countries tbh.

"egh8dnn","t3_aql3u0","aql3u0","climatechange","action-oriented","The problem is the laws of thermodynamics.  Some reactions release energy (like burning fossil fuels); some reactions require energy (like making plants out of CO2 using energy from the sun).  

Direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere would need a fleet of nuclear power stations.  But there are some interesting alternatives ...

"eh81mgy","t3_aql3u0","aql3u0","climatechange","action-oriented","Methane is such a small part of the air that we can't easily trap it to burn for energy. Also, absorbing the carbon and sequestering would be great, but scientists haven't figured out the best way to do it yet.","2019-02-25 03:58:31","1","[deleted]","1747904494.952055","carbon capture","manual"
"eghwulg","t3_aql3u0","aql3u0","climatechange","action-oriented","\> isn't methane a source of energy?

Note how everyone responding completely ignores methane and just talks about CO2 and carbon emissions. You're not allowed to talk about other gases and definitely not ""pollution;"" that's a dirty word. In reality of course CO2 is the single most important molecule for all carbon based lifeforms and is a clear and harmless gas but the narrative always attempts to paint it as somehow harmful. If you're ever in the unfortunate position of having respiratory problems and they give you an oxygen mask you will actually be breathing in 1-5% CO2 vs the 0.004% in the atmosphere.
