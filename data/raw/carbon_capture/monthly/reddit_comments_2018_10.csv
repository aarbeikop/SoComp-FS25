This is a new an emerging industry with so many benefits. So much so, I think even Republicans will be on board. Check out climeworks and carbon engineering. 

Clean meat is coming.... hopefully by the end of this year. JUST foods say they'll have chicken for us to purchase and Memphis Foods will be available in 2021. The impossible burger is pretty yummy too and it's being sold nation wide at White Castle. Support these movements!

Each half-degree of warming is very meaningful and has consequences above and beyond that before it.

This will result in saving lives in the most vulnerable communities. 

Also, just for the sake of mental health, would giving up really make you feel better?

It is hard to find a balance, but I think varying your viewpoint instead of just looking at the macro-view (which is very overwhelming, I agree) all the time helps. I personally work in adaptation, and that has helped me put it in perspective. Changes are here and more are on the way, so we can prepare and work to limit them as much as possible, but that's really all we can do.

"e8nzn9b","t3_9scwyx","9scwyx","climatechange","action-oriented","If you spend just a little time reading past posts in this forum, you'll see that this question is a constant refrain here. 

So: Repeating here my comment from [another post on a similar topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/95p77y/what_else_can_i_do_to_help/e3ul7wo/):

***

In a word, the solution is: Adaptation.

Which people are pretty good at in the long run, as long as we have access to some key tools: science, technology, finance, and a modest amount of global coordination.

Technology is a big one. Eventually technology will develop solutions to three problems:

1) Making fossil fuels a minor source of energy supply, instead of a major one like they are now.

2) Finding a way to extract and sequester the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

3) Making the global climate a tunable environment, like a laboratory or a manmade lake or your bedroom.

The question is, how quickly will these problems encounter technological fixes? #3 probably isn't happening in this century, but seems possible for the next. #1 and #2 are unpredictable, but it's reasonable to guess that major strides will be made in this century.

In the meantime, technology will also be needed to enable populations to adjust to some local phenomena:

1) Sea-level rise, by investing in coastal defense. (A technology which has existed for millennia.)

2) Ocean acidification.

3) Ecosystem pressures, possibly including some collapses. These could be severe, although note that ecosystems have collapsed in the past and civilization has adjusted well enough to those.

4) A higher-energy troposphere, which might mean more severe storms.

The financial system is an integral part of developing the necessary technologies, making the necessary investments, and possibly developing the necessary global coordination. In fact, for now burning fossil fuels is probably also an integral part of that process.

There's more than technology needed, of course. There's also a great need to amass huge amounts of data — so climate risks and fixes can be properly modeled and priced, for instance. Most of that data isn't available now, but amassing it in the future is another part of the solution.

But again, the solution condensed into a single word is: Adaptation. Which people are pretty good at, once a pressing need develops. If you are very concerned about climate risks, then you'll be constantly improving capacities to adapt — yours, and your society's.

The climate is not one of the top hundred most important influences on your life decisions. It might not even be in the top thousand. Its influence could easily be negligible.

Anyone who decides not to start a family will get full encouragement from me; I think plenty of people make ill-considered decisions about that. But regardless of my encouragement, you should invest in whatever makes you feel happy and fulfilled, and enables you to play a constructive role in helping other people reach their goals.

Also here's another comment on a similar topic:

[It's fair to say that technology will continue to advance, and the problem of excess atmospheric CO2 is not insoluble in principle. Inevitably one day we'll have the ability to tune the composition of the atmosphere, if we wish. But the main complication is: We have a lot of other civilization-level problems to solve, many of them extremely urgent, and the vast majority of our technological resources are going to be dedicated to addressing those problems (as they should be).](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/97rzul/technology_might_still_save_us/e4aj79h/).

And this one too:

[The endgame — for the second half of the 21st century, let's say — is: Global economic growth will slowly converge with its historical average. Technology advances will continue to accelerate mildly. These trends will continue to be partially obscured by exogenous shocks of varying disruptiveness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e6700hr/)

And amplifying that one:

[Really, climate change is not greatly different than a lot of exogenous shocks that have existed for centuries, and which we tend to feel (and measure) in economic conditions first. My answer is just a summary of economic orthodoxy of the post-WWII era — there's nothing original in it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e672k83/)

And more about the process of climate adaptation:

[Adaptation is unquestionably the best strategy for confronting climate issues — at least until the global climate system is understood well enough to be predictably altered via relatively modest steps. (An achievement which is at least several decades in the future, maybe a century.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9j2oum/deep_adaption_in_bloomberg_businessweek/e6r09av/)

And finally, a possible way to frame realistic optimism: 

[Real climate remediation is only going to be possible as long as it stays within limits set by some very compelling civilizational priorities:
1) The need for economic growth, primarily to combat poverty ¶ 2) The need for people to access ways to optimize their own health, whether that means vaccination, healthcare or eating meat ¶ 3) The need to respect basic human rights, represented here by the freedom to produce as many offspring as each individual chooses](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9rk3id/looking_for_case_studies_people_who_quit_or_cut/e8huebo/)","2018-10-29 15:11:39","11","DocHarford","1747899983.0967329","carbon capture","manual"
"e8riqfx","t3_9scwyx","9scwyx","climatechange","action-oriented","Two things have really, really helped my climate anxiety.  One is accepting that we have already failed to 'stop' climate change but that every reduction in C02 helps slow and reduce the impacts so there is meaningful work to be done.  The other thing is that climate action is the cure for climate anxiety.  Talk to other people who understand, call your representatives, get out there and make people wake up.  Some of them will notice and you will feel a lot better when you feel less alone.

I learned to look at positive changes I can feasibly make in my own life, and then realized that other people can do it to when they have to. I know we need to change our lifestyles TODAY, but for a lot of people (myself included), that is just financially possible. But, write out a 5-year plan to significantly make these changes. The changes below won’t be easy, but they are extremely plausible. Do them, and convince other people to do the same. The amazing future utopia we all dream about can be here within the next few generations. We just have to make it there.

-Immediately cut gasoline usage by >10% by walking/biking for local errands. Within 3 years, at least one of our two cars will be hybrid or electric. Within 5 years, one will be electric, and the other will be hybrid or electric.

-Within 2 months we can cut our electric consumption by 1/4 (retrofit house with LEDs and smart thermostats to start). Within 2 years, at least 50% of my home electric will be from renewable resources. Within 5 years, at least 90%. (This one also assumes that our local utility will also be partially providing from renewable resources as pressures mount).

-Within 2 months reduce meat consumption by 75-80%. Plant a vegetable garden within a year and grow as much as possible.

-Cut garbage waste by half within 4 months. This can be roughly measured by looking at how full your garbage can is when you bring it to the curb. 

-Convince my boss to setup a cogen system and consider a solar field. The cogen system make perfect sense for us (use waste heat from compressors in the drying stage of our process). The solar field is a tough sell, but if the money makes sense, he will pounce on it.
