"dxufu5u","t3_8eazg1","8eazg1","collapse","skeptical","If you are interested in an evidence based approach to forecasting the future of society, economics, geopolitics and the environment then I cannot recommend the book 2052 by Jorgen Randers enough. Not only does he look at current trends but creates a forecast where each of these aspects influences each of the others in myriad ways, meaning that no aspect of the forecast contradicts any other. 

For example, higher co2 levels increase the rate at which plants grow, but also cause global warming, which negatively impacts plant growth. Although the average food yield will eventually decline because of co2 levels, the decline will be postponed by this effect. This sudden decline in food yields, or rather, this sudden increase in the amount of land required to grow enough food for a certain population, will be a bigger issue in some nations than in others. The US will need to drastically rethink where it gets its food, but could still theoretically support itself. China on the other hand will not be self sufficient for several decades, meaning that it will rely on food imports for a number of years. This then impacts geopolitics, etc... 

This is just one tiny part of the puzzle. The book is chock-full of shit like this.

If you're wondering, Randers does forecast a global collapse (which he defines as a rapid decline in population, quality of life and gdp) after a long period of decline for west (which he defines as a gradual decline in consumption per person, regardless of the rate at which population and gdp are changing). He forecasts that this decline will feel like a collapse to many. When people talk about collapse having already started on this sub, that's what they are referring to. The forecast suggests that this decline will be most painful for the USA. 

The forecast suggests that the collapse will occur after 2052, and as such the book doesn't focus on it too much. Nonetheless, understanding all the ways these systems affect one another is going to be a crucial survival skill this century. 

I can't recommend any book on the subject more than this one. ","2018-04-23 19:29:35","13","AbyssOfUnknowing","1747893573.859482","carbon capture","manual"

Correct that the rich and the government COULD do a hell of a lot more to mitigate this or even indeed FIX this. But they are paid quite well NOT to.

You drive a car? motor bike? you own a dog? You had a kid or ten?
you buy imported products that have to be shipped around the world? Is most of what you eat and drink contained in plastic?
Do you go on holidays abroad and fly there? Do you have heating system in your house running on gas or coal?

You see you are responsible for your little bit. But you can say you are conditioned to live the way you live. Your parents, your schooling, the TV and society have all played their part on conditioning your mind to be oblivious to the damage you cause by your modern developed lifestyle. You are programmed to be a consumer and to buy buy buy all your life. You were never told the damage these big companies do to the environment to make the products you keep buying. Until that one day when you woke up and learned for yourself all about it.

So yes you can say they are responsible. But you have not yet moved into a cave or mud hut and given up your developed life, so you too are responsible for your little part in all this. As am I.","2018-04-20 11:47:44","27","Robinhood192000","1747893726.211714","carbon capture","manual"

Both matter. For example: genetically engineered food labeled, enough consumers would avoid the products to end the viability of genetically engineered food as a business model. Once GE foods become ubiquitous, with little to only difficult to access alternatives, transparency becomes irrelevant.

Even at this stage, if those who can avoid CAFO meats did so, it would destroy the business model. (This recognizes that it's not necessarily difficult for a significant minority to determine where their meat is coming from and adjust their choices.)
