"9a7j8g","collapse","skeptical","CO2 scrubbing is a bit fat lie to keep us controllable.","A few points about our savour ""CO2 scrubbing"" or BECCS as it's known.......

1: The CO2 scrubber system has to remove ALL the CO2 we're making right now each year.

2: The CO2 amount we make goes UP each year. (its not even going up by a steady amount - did you know that?)

3: The scrubber has to remove existing CO2 already in the atmosphere to get us back to 350ppm - because there's a 40 to 60 year delay between CO2 and the maximal warming it does. (could be more)

4: The scrubber has to prevent its own CO2 emissions from reaching the atmosphere. (Almost like lowering EROEI for oil, this machine needs to be colossal and even if it's run on green energy, THAT equipment is made with oil, and the CO2 scrubbers are made via oil... and covers millions of acres of land)

5: And the storage of it all takes energy, and where?

6: And the cost. Trillions of dollars ""taken out"" of the economy, might just kill the global system. Interest on loans NEEDS economic growth all it all crashes down. No loans, no economy, we all starve. (VERY shit system)

7: We (green thinking countries) also need to PREVENT nations from emitting CO2. ""Hey India, China, Russia, and states of Africa - you can't have industry using coal or oil. Just our very expensive renewables."" Many will think it's a drive to keep them down.

8: **EVERY GREEN initiative we've EVER done** - hasn't stopped CO2 emissions speeding up. We need to x 20 our efforts or more! (This  is way beyond recycling straws, and buying LED lights. This is shutting down swathes of the economy)

#Stop a second and just read number 8 again.

That's including the Kyoto Protocol, that's including the Paris agreement, that's the implementation of all the green energy we've done,  that's the power saving light bulbs, that's the office equipment off at night, all the new super efficient vehicles, every last bin of recycling...... the whole lot. It didn't even slow down the rate of acceleration! - (There's a Red Dwarf sketch about something like that.)

**We are so so so fucked........ ""negative emission tec"" due to the reasons I state up there just WON'T work the way we're approaching it right now.**

I'm convinced it's a pandemic, nuclear war, or an asteroid that will stop a greater catastrophe.

How could it be worse than a pandemic you ask?

Check with Russia's and Ireland's famines. **Not a blade of grass nor root was left uneaten** despite the population declining - they made the food producing things decline FASTER.

They followed the food down to zero - and it's only external influences that sorted it out.

You don't need to be reminded this is a global situation - there is no more external help.
