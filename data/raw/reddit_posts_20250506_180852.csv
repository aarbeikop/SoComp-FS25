**Last Week in Collapse: April 27-May 3, 2025**

This is *Last Week in Collapse*, a weekly newsletter compiling some of the most important, timely, useful, soul-crushing, ironic, amazing, or otherwise must-see/can’t-look-away moments in Collapse. 

This is the 175th weekly newsletter. You can find the April 20-26, 2025 edition [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k90gwb/last_week_in_collapse_april_2026_2025/) if you missed it last week.

Earth’s fastest warming place, the Arctic, is undergoing some changes. The permafrost is melting, the [**tundra is greening**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/arctic-plant-study-warning-climate-change), and the ecosystems are changing. “Species turnover” is common, according to [the study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8) in *Nature*. “Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness…temperature and plant–plant interactions {are} emerging as the main drivers of change.” 

A [landslide in Peru](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz6d4nlgzdlo) killed two. [**Wildfires** in Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/israel-fires-wildfires-jerusalem)—the worst in a decade—approach Jerusalem. [Brutal **heat wave** conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/30/india-and-pakistan-already-sweltering-in-new-normal-heatwave-conditions)—as high as **50 °C** in parts of Pakistan—hit India & Pakistan at the end of April, worse and ahead of schedule. [Permafrost continues to melt](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-permafrost-dots-siberia-rash-mounds.html) in Russia, where about two thirds of the land is covered in permafrost; scientists are also concerned about centuries-old diseases emerging from the ice. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01046-4) on tree ring sizes, published in *NPJ*, determined that last summer was **Scandinavia’s warmest in 2000+ years**. 

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424659122) in *PNAS* estimates a **15% chance** of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake striking the western coast of North America within the next 50 years. The scientists say such an event could collapse coastal land up to six feet (two meters) and also raise the sea level; it is also hard to plan for, unless you simply move away before it happens. Another [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb7f3), in *Environmental Research Letters*, attempts to reinterpret the notions of resilience and tipping points in dynamic systems. This complex piece of research attempts to mathematize systems theory, and emphasizes the randomness of “**bifurcation points**,” phase space, and more. It’s hard to summarize, and even harder to understand.

Scientists [theorized in a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF005567) published in *Earth’s Future* that we could scale up the geoengineering technique known as [**stratospheric aerosol injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection) (SAI) without building new, high-altitude aircraft. Using existing fleets of jets would enable more countries to begin SAI operations, and at a much faster pace, but with consequences. This approach “would have strongly reduced efficiency and therefore increased side-effects for a given global cooling. It would also produce a more polar cooling distribution, with reduced efficacy in the tropics.” Current passenger planes fly at a maximum altitude of about 12 km, and ideal SAI would take place at altitudes above 20 km. [According to the lead author](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-geoengineering-technique-cool-planet-aircraft.html), “At this lower altitude, stratospheric aerosol injection is about one-third as effective. That means that **we would need to use three times the amount of aerosol** to have the same effect on global temperature, increasing side effects such as acid rain.” 

A “full-blown wildfire and forest health crisis” is the pretest being used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to [streamline deforestation](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-georgia-national-forests.html) of some national forests in Georgia. The crisis in question involves proliferation of native species, heightened wildfire risk, and pest/disease outbreaks among the wildlife. And while some [nations move to draft a treaty](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-horizon-momentum-high-seas-treaty.html) protecting life in the high seas, the U.S. is moving full-steam ahead on plans to mine rare earth minerals from the seafloor, with whatever attendant environmental consequences.

A 45-page [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/triple-threat-climate-change-conflict-and-hunger-endangering-childrens-lives) on the triple threat of climate change, conflict, and hunger examines their impact across 9 developing countries.

>“As climate change renders certain areas uninhabitable due to rising sea levels, desertification or extreme weather events, **populations are forced to migrate**….people who said climate hazards were making it difficult for them to access water or food were 27% more likely to have witnessed conflict….almost 90% of people agreeing (somewhat or completely) to the statement that climate change poses a serious threat to their family….The extraction of natural resources is necessary to make the transition to green economies, but demand for natural minerals has driven human rights abuses….The very resource that’s integral to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy and slow climate change, could also **exacerbate climate change** at the same time….”

Kazakhstan [set new April records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916894371771023554) in the last week of the month. Parts of Afghanistan meanwhile [hit 46 °C](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916879049340993864) (115 °F). The heat wave hit Pakistan, too, [with similar temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916845204985835769), where demand for electricity [**forced load-shedding**](https://english.aaj.tv/news/330414249/karachi-faces-extended-hours-of-power-outage-amid-hot-weather) onto the population in Karachi (metro pop: 18M). Snowfall in the Himalayas [hit a 23-year low](https://www.earth.com/news/snowfall-drops-in-hindu-kush-himalayas-water-crisis-may-follow/), portending a future water crisis that may spiral into serious conflict soon enough. China’s temperatures in April [broke a 64-year record](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1333059.shtml)...and [in May](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1918352572487762196).  The Moscow area [felt record snowfall](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/02/late-spring-snow-hits-moscow-toppling-trees-and-causing-power-outages-a88949) for the first few days of May.

Heat wave [in South Africa](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916859952783654949), and [in Iraq](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1916439307868307832), and new APril highs [in Indonesia](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1917496648575467768) closed out the month. **Global mean temperatures** are [hovering at their record high](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3lo4bm3o5hc2k) and a [dust storm](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/severe-dust-storm-sweeps-9-arab-states-worsening-gaza-s-plight-/3554300) passed through 10 countries in the Middle East. The Greek island of Lesvos [declared an emergency](https://greekcitytimes.com/2025/05/02/lesvos-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-severe-water-shortage/) for one month over low water levels, while [a reservoir in Syria](https://anfenglish.com/rojava-syria/tishrin-dam-in-northern-syria-on-the-brink-of-collapse-due-to-water-shortage-79125) has seen its levels drop so low that electrical production will be prevented if it drops one more meter.  

A [study](https://www.carbonbrief.org/forests-taking-longer-to-recover-from-severe-megafires-since-2010/) from two weeks ago states that forests recover from wildfires less quickly now than they used to—especially those afflicted from **megafires**. The primary reasons behind this delayed recovery are drier soil and temperature changes. 

——————————

On Monday, a [**sudden power outage**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/no-one-knew-what-to-do-power-cuts-bring-chaos-connection-and-revaluation-of-digital-dependency) across [most of Portugual, Spain](https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-portugal-power-blackouts-energy-electricity/),  and parts of France left 55M people without electricity for about 10 hours. It was [one of Europe’s worst](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250430-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-massive-blackout-that-hit-spain-and-portugal) power outages, and the cause is still unclear. The incident highlighted human dependence on electricity, stranding passengers in trains and metros, shutting down electrical payment systems, and leaving emergency services dependent on generators. At least [five people died](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/spanish-pm-private-energy-firms-help-find-cause-power-cut) as a result. Imagine if it happened during a vicious heat wave, or another inconvenient moment. One day it ~~might~~ will.

Immunologists [are warning](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity) that the progression of measles has demonstrated the reality of a “post-herd-immunity world” in which we are trapped. The U.S> measles outbreak now [spans 29 states](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-cases-surpass-900-us-infections-confirmed-29/story?id=121391716), with **over 900 confirmed cases**. 

Some scientists claim to have discovered a new “**anthropoclastic rock cycle**” off the coast of the UK. The [study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/doi/10.1130/G52895.1/653591/Evidence-for-a-rapid-anthropoclastic-rock-cycle) found that chemical processes involving the erosion of slag deposits in the ocean accelerated rock formation. In short, new sedimentary rocks—also containing plastic, aluminum can bits, and other garbage—were formed in about 35 years. Scientists say that this will quickly preserve a geologic record of some of our garbage.

The U.S. is [**stopping salmonella testing**](https://www.foxla.com/news/usda-salmonella-levels-raw-poultry-usda-withdraws-plan?taid=680e9f8b3d26750001e41bef) requirements across a range of poultry products. Salmonella currently infects about 1.35M Americans annually, leading to a few hundred deaths per year. An [upcoming study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389425012099) found that, [in summary](https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2025/05/study-finds-synergistic-convergence-of-global-warming-pesticide-toxicity-and-antibiotic-resistance/), “**warming increases pesticide toxicity**; pesticide toxicity triggers antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (movement through the environment to people) and predation.”

**Unemployment** rates in Germany [hit 10-year highs](https://archive.ph/b0ygz), and the South Korean [economy sank](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/economy/11304830) for six consecutive months. Confidence in the U.S. Dollar [is weakening](https://thehill.com/opinion/5270094-trump-tariffs-dollar-decline/) as tariffs and uncertainty in the United States grow—a [reckoning might be coming](https://archive.ph/yNwAZ) soon. The [**loss of trust** in the market](https://archive.ph/jhbua) may not return after Trump leaves office. China [is planning](https://archive.ph/zQNoc) on moving forward without as many American food exports.

[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020) on Long COVID found that the most common symptoms were “**fatigue** (25.4%), **shortness of breath** (24.7%), and **joint pain** (24.7%).” Researchers [found a set of proteins](https://www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/long-covid-biomarker-found-in-blood-of-affected-patients-399162) in people’s blood which is “linked to inflammatory signal pathways involved in cell death and lung damage.” Some writers [argue](https://newsroom.co.nz/2025/04/29/nzs-long-covid-blind-spot-nothing-short-of-a-crisis/) that we are suffering a pandemic of willful blindness to the dangers of Long COVID. When was the last time you saw someone wearing a mask?

The **Global Virus Network** published [a report](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103) in *The Lancet* urging more preventive action taken on bird flu, including: “enhanced surveillance and monitoring, faster genomic data sharing, improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, and international collaboration…..Current sequence data from circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses indicate ongoing mutations and reassortment/mixing of genomic segments…” Some countries, like Poland, have [gone big in chicken farming](https://www.eenews.net/articles/poland-bet-the-farm-on-poultry-bird-flu-could-ruin-everything/) because it offers a low-overhead, climate-friendlier source of meat. Yet in the last 13 months, [bird flu has been confirmed](https://archive.ph/Ix8Jh) in over 1,000 dairy herds across the United States.

[US-UK **airstrikes in Yemen**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/uk-yemen-airstrikes-houthi-rebels) blasted locations allegedly used in producing drones. [Other strikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/yemen-houthi-rebels-say-scores-killed-in-us-airstrike-on-prison) on Monday **slew 68** in a Yemeni detention center, wounding dozens of others. Meanwhile, The U.S. [designated two coalitions of gangs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/haiti-gangs-terrorist-groups-us) in Haiti as terrorist groups as they near complete control of Port-Au-Prince. And Germany has [classified](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/afd-extremist-label-sets-up-political-high-wire-act-for-friedrich-merz) a far-right political party—currently the country’s [most popular party](https://theconversation.com/far-right-afd-tops-german-poll-for-first-time-just-weeks-after-friedrich-merzs-election-win-255254)—as an extremist organization, empowering the government to spy on the party’s communications. 

[**Arbitrary arrests**](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/least-89-arbitrary-arrests-recorded-syria-april-2025-enar) made in Syria. Hundreds were also [arrested in Türkiye](https://news.sky.com/story/hundreds-arrested-in-turkey-during-worldwide-may-day-demonstrations-and-rallies-13359146) during **May Day protests**. India’s army is [allegedly poised](https://archive.ph/Ni8Ny) to stamp out hundreds of armed communist guerrillas, naxalites, in the country’s southeast. Niagara Falls—the Canadian side, mostly—is getting [**overwhelmed**](https://archive.ph/ltsOv) **by migrants**. 

Uganda’s octogenarian president is [trying to prosecute civilians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/uganda-opposition-accuses-president-military-courts-quash-dissent)—his political opponents—in **military tribunals** which may carry the death penalty. Mali’s post-coup government has [declared their leading General](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddej3g123do), Assimi Goïta, to a 5-year term as President. Goïta has been the interim president since 2021, when he seized power in a coup d’état (his [second successful coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) ). Togo’s President [got himself installed in a new position](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjl9l9z7zjo) that will enable him to rule the country indefinitely—his family has been in power for 58 years now. 

Helicopters [**bombed a hospital**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2536m9r2eo) in South Sudan and reportedly opened fire on a city for half an hour; seven were slain. Not far away, in Sudan, rebel forces were said to have [**slain 37**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/27/sudan-doctors-network-accuses-rsf-of-war-crimes-after-31-killed). Reporting from Khartoum indicates that the Sudan War [destroyed the world’s oldest mycetoma research center](https://archive.ph/TV5HN), including 40+ years of data. [Mycetoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycetoma) is a bacterial/fungal infection of the skin, usually the feet. Over 540 people are [said to have been **killed**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/1/sudan-horror-knows-no-bounds-says-un-as-deaths-in-darfur-rise) **in Sudan** over the past three weeks, with other estimates going much higher. 

North Korea [launched a **new naval destroyer**](https://news.sky.com/story/kim-jong-un-unveils-north-koreas-new-naval-destroyer-equipped-with-the-most-powerful-weapons-13355744), reportedly capable of launching nuclear ballistic missiles. [Japan is sweating](https://archive.ph/5ydUJ) over Chinese maneuvers around Taiwan, and considering how deeply they would be involved in a future War.

A [Russian drone attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd02x9zr78ro) in Odesa killed two and injured several more. A [**minerals deal**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-russia) was agreed between the U.S. and Ukraine which will, in theory, pay the U.S. a portion of the profits from rare earth and other minerals/oil/gas extracted in Ukraine—until $175B USD is repaid to the U.S. (Read the [full deal text here](https://kyivindependent.com/exclusive-the-full-text-of-the-final-us-ukraine-mineral-agreement/) if interested.) Using the Vietnam War as an example, some experts are [worried about **widespread damage**](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-years-vietnam-environment-scars-war.html) **to the environment** in Ukraine and Gaza in the decades after the bombs stop. For the first time, a Ukrainian sea drone [shot down a Russian fighter jet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/ukraine-war-briefing-maritime-drone-shoots-down-russian-fighter-jet-for-first-time-says-kyiv).  And, although Russians make small gains along the frontlines, Ukraine [declared victory](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-victory-pokrovsk-donetsk-russia-2065951) in the strategic city of Pokrovsk. UN annual funding for Ukraine [is being reprioritized](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/ukraine-war-briefing-un-slashes-humanitarian-aid-after-sharp-fall-in-funding) and reduced by about one third (to $1.75B).

While some sources indicate 30,000+ people join the Russian army every month (one way or another), Russian authorities are discussing a potential [**WWII-style mobilization**](https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-says-russia-ready-for-full-scale-mobilization-like-in-wwii-at-any-moment/), which involves not only the armed forces, but also industry and society more generally. Poland is [scaling up military training](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9exj0nn0ko) for civilians as fears of Russian aggression grow. Ukraine’s energy minister [warned](https://archive.ph/0kdhY) that Russia is gambling with nuclear meltdown by targeting nuclear power plants and the repair teams working at their substations. “**We have been one step short of a nuclear meltdown many times now**,” he said. Russia also [acknowledged North Koreans](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/05/03/frontline-report-russia-plans-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-new-offensives-in-eastern-ukraine) fighting for them for the first time, finally discarding the pretense of implausible deniability. 

The sounds of battle—**shelling, gunfire, explosions**—were heard around Damascus (metro pop: 2.8M), Syria on Tuesday & Wednesday. At least [16 were slain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/deadly-syria-clashes-continue-for-second-day-outside-damascus) in attacks against the Druze minority, though some sources [say 40+ dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kjn0jkjo). The attack was reportedly triggered by a **deepfake audio recording** of a Druze cleric insulting the prophet Muhammad, spread on social media. Israel [is reportedly operating against](https://apnews.com/article/syria-israel-druze-clashes-sahnaya-jaramana-40f8aeec865c1d81f128b05ef21dfa59) some of the Syrian forces complicit in the attack. 

Two months after Israel imposed a blockade on supplies to Gaza, food is [running out](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2vz02e7g8o). Israeli sky drones [attacked & disabled a ship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/gaza-humanitarian-aid-ship-bombed-drones-waters-off-malta) off the coast of Malta, which was planning on challenging the blockade to deliver supplies to Gaza. The vessel was *en route* to Malta, where it was also going to pick up Greta Thunberg. In Gaza, [**airstrikes killed 17** on Friday](https://archive.ph/ZOnQa) on Friday, people are raiding warehouses for supplies, [airstrikes killed dozens more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/03/israeli-airstrikes-gaza-death-toll-bureij-beit-lahiya-khan-younis) on Saturday, food prices [continue rising](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/gaza-on-brink-of-catastrophe-as-aid-runs-out-and-prices-soar-groups-warn), and the IDF is [**summoning tens of thousands of reservists**](https://www.yahoo.com/news/reports-israel-calls-tens-thousands-213032823.html) to service. Hours ago, a Houthi drone [struck near Ben Gurion airport](https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1918917490287026668); no casualties.  

A 54-page, U.S.-aligned think tank [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2025) on **threats in space**—by countries—was published two weeks ago. Although no new space or counterspace technologies have been deployed in the past year, the writers claim that old trends worsened and state capabilities sharpened. The report does not mention the possibility of [Kessler Syndrome](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/understanding-the-misunderstood-kessler-syndrome/). Although funding for the Pentagon is set to decrease, President Trump’s [overall **defense budget hit new highs**](https://archive.ph/ZjRyI), breaching $1T for the first time ever. And that doesn’t even include [increases to Homeland Security](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/02/politics/trump-budget-proposal-defense-spending)’s budget—or mention the wide-ranging cuts to science, welfare, health, and environmental programs.

>“the growth of **commercial and military dual-use technologies** that could be modified to serve a counterspace purpose.…widespread jamming and spoofing of GPS signals in and around conflict zones….a common thread throughout this year’s report is how space fits into the future of warfare. The normalization of space as a military operational domain and its integral role in joint operations mean that **space is fair game during conflict**….space is likely becoming a more dangerous place…” -excerpts from the Space Report

India and Pakistan are escalating their……theatrics/preparation/negotiation/deterrence. India [test-fired missiles](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/india-test-fires-missiles-tensions-rise-pakistan-kashmir-attack) last Sunday. On Wednesday, Pakistani authorities [said](https://www.newsweek.com/pakistan-india-kashmir-nuclear-missiles-war-2066322) that India was planning “**imminent military action**” within 24-36 hours, but nothing yet materialized. On Saturday, Pakistan [test-fired a ballistic missile](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/3/pakistan-test-fires-ballistic-missile-as-tensions-with-india-rise). Some observers believe India [may launch restrained raids](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/411219/india-pakistan-kashmir-terrorist-attack-war) into Pakistan’s part of Kashmir [next](https://archive.ph/DUgG1). Each country possesses approximately **170 nuclear weapons.**

***Things to watch for next week include:***

↠ President Putin [declared a **72-hour ceasefire**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62j1848509o) from 8-11 May. President Zelenskyy [was non-committal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drones-kharkiv-4396be6394f46a6320cac4bf82be2941) on the idea. We’ll see if this ceasefire can last more than a few hours…

***Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:***

-2025 has started with **large bee dieoffs**, if [this report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscurePatentDangers/comments/1jp18rq/millions_of_bees_have_died_this_year_its_the), already a month old, from the niche subreddit r/ObscurePatentDangers is to be bee-lieved. Have you seen many bees yet this year? 

-**Homelessness**, aggressive policing, obstetricians closing, empty rental properties, class warfare, and supply problems have come to America’s Pacific Northwest, based on [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpjd8ee/) from u/resonanteye is accurate. 

-Tokyo is having train delays, says [this weekly observation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1k9rt9r/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/mpmlwap/) from the world’s largest megacity (metro pop: 38M, *shiiiiit*). **Food shortages**, including for rice, are also being recorded. Crime is reportedly rising, and the weather is becoming less predictable.

-The subreddit r/collapse is itself undergoing **enshittification**, if [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kaairw/i_have_followed_this_sub_for_10_years_and_i/)’s thesis—bad faith actors have intentionally poisoned the discourse—is true. I would posit a slightly alternative hypothesis: the reason society/tech/culture/everything is being enshittified is because we ourselves are suffering from enshittification. Perhaps we are becoming worse people. Yes, you too. (Yes, me too.)

-Or perhaps the reason Reddit, and most everything else, seems to be getting worse is that **AI bots and spammers are everywhere**, everything has become weaponized, and the patterns of manipulation are too subtle to be recognized, understood, and countered. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1kapnns/researchers_secretly_experimented_on_reddit_users/) from last week exposed an experiment that used AI to manipulate r/changemyview and hijack discourse. [**Ragebait** 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage-baiting). I am sure this goes far, far beyond one popular subreddit. Resilience begins with you. 

Got any feedback, questions, comments, upvotes, empty protests, legal philosophies, rants at the sky, canning advice, etc.? ***Last Week in Collapse*** is also [posted on **Substack**](https://substack.com/profile/18092228-last-week-in-collapse); if you don’t want to check r/collapse every Sunday, you can receive this newsletter sent to an email inbox every weekend. Next week’s edition may be shorter than usual, since I will be traveling most of the week. As always, thank you for your support.
