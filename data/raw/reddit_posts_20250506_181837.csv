1kb2n59,sustainability,action-oriented,I was just being cheap… but I guess I’m eco-conscious now?,"I've been buying refurbished tech ever since I discovered it but honestly, I didn’t do it to be sustainable or anything like that. I just hate spending more money than I need to.

When my old laptop died, I grabbed a refurbished one to save cash, then I did the same with my phone, and a watch.

Next thing I know I’m reducing e-waste, skipping all the unnecessary packaging and still getting solid performance. I didn’t expect my frugal habits to line up with helping the planet  but hey, I’ll take it.

Anyone else accidentally doing good for the world just by being stingy?
