mqsztks,t3_1kfip1o,1kfip1o,climatechange,action-oriented,"The sleeper issue with climate change is its effects on agriculture and agricultural commodity PRICES.

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:

I write and post on a number of sites and have been attacked for having no “academic credentials” in any field related to climate science. I do not wish to misrepresent myself as a “climate scientist” or “climate expert” to anyone who is reading this or any of my other climate related posts, so let us be clear:

I am not a climatologist, meteorologist, paleo-climatologist, geoscientist, ecologist, or climate science specialist. I am a motivated individual studying the issue using publicly available datasets and papers.

The analysis I am presenting is my own. I make no claim to “insider or hidden knowledge” and all the points I discuss can be verified with only a few hours of research on the Internet.

The analysis and opinion I present, in this and my other climate articles is exactly that: my opinion. I hope anyone reading it finds it useful, informative, and insightful but in the end, it is just my opinion.

Submission statement: This is collapse related because it outlines the potential long-term consequences of aggressive deregulation, particularly on climate policy, public health, and democratic processes. Experts in the text warn that these rollbacks could lead to environmental degradation, legal instability, and increased pollution.

No, capitalism is just a means by which the Super-organism uses it for faster more efficient consumption.  

Lot of people want to blame capitalism for the state of the world and no doubt it has contributed to it.  However absent capitalism the Super-organism would use a different method for increasing consumption.

With that said, I really have been hoping Nate would have Jason Hickel on an episode. I think a really great discussion would be had between them and I don't know if there is an ideological reason this hasn't happened, a desire to not get too into socioeconomic relations at risk of alienating his audience, or just a simple case of schedules not lining up.

mqr8l2g,t3_1kf23io,1kf23io,collapse,skeptical,While its true that capitalism is a mechanism to increase the rate of resource uptake and global consumption I don't think its capitalism. Capitalism or communism or some other form of organizing society are just means to decide how the surplus from industrial production is distributed in the society. While capitalism has led to a faster exploitation of nature and materials even in Stalin's time the goal was industrial production and workers who mined more were given praises and recognition.  The roots of the superorganism is might lie in the so-called growth imperative which simply means that economic growth is essential to society. This manifest as interest-rate on savings or debt more generally which creates a growth imperative. As to why this happened I am not so sure. Its not like there are some greedy individuals who were pulling the string and forsaw it all. While its true for short term profit motives I suspect even they couldn't forsee the trajectory of the human industrial society. Daniel Schmachtenberger (hope i got the name right) thinks that we arrived at this superorganism simply by virtue of following short term narrow boundary goals. No one is actively trying to kill the environment but the process of achieving one's goals (whatever they may be) put them in active opposition to the preservation of life and biodiversity on this earth. Take for example  buying lunch for oneself around worksite. It is possible that packed lunch or beverage will contain single-use plastic that will exist for a very long time without degrading and cause problems to other species. This really narrow goal of feeding oneself is at odds with preservation of animal species. If I understand correctly the solution is to actually have deterrent from the very beginning in a society to prevent such behaviour where an individual can 'win' at the cost of others by simply not following the rules. This used to be the case in small societies but in city level dwellings the connection between humans is lost and individual behaviour is dictated by these narrow boundary goals. The costs are externalities which one is not held accountable for. A good example of this is corporations (which are still a small group of people) polluting in other countries.,1746472006.0,3,yangihara,1746547679.7603588,climate crisis,emotional

He's from the banking sector. He doesn't want to see all his old friends as the problem, first against the wall situation.

If I was a little more cynical, I'd say those in power (capitalists) want to shift the blame towards anything but themselves, and Hagens values his podcast and audience more than actually telling the truth, and thus capitulates. But I'm not quite that cynical. I think Hagens believes what he says.

Maybe Hagens has business sense and wants to distinguish himself from all the socialists saying capitalism is the problem.
