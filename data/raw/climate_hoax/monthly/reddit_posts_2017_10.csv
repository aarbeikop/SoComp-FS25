Why isn’t there a clear clarion call to fight global warming? Where are the moral leaders at this time? Are not the ones that want to dismiss global warming as a hoax or deny or reject it similar to those who at the time prior to the founding of our country wanted to stay within the colony within the empire of Brittan? Did not they fight the colonist from making the changes that needed to be made to advance into history? Is the United States to be relegated to the climate deniers? The ones who help the most the destruction that is to come? The ones that reject the destruction that is to come? For all eternity for all history of man for as long as that may be? For all the destruction wrought all the calamities and diseases wrought by global warming the United States of America will forever be thrown into the company of disease, disaster, rejection, and destruction of the world. Why is it that many of those who purport to believe in god would deny their children what god has provided the believers themselves? Their children and their grandchildren, they will snatch what is given by god right out of the future for those folks who will come after. Where do they get that chutzpah? Where do they get that disease that Captain Ahab had? Is it the twenty dollar gold piece on the mast that drives everybody insane to their own destruction and death in the search of the great White Whale of rejection of science and all that is good in America and assert white Nazi racism to destroy the Pequod the ship that is our country and has stood its stead well? Yet there are those who do not want changes; those who would reject life itself; those who would rather destroy than to build; those who would build rickety shacks on sand and liquefaction prone soil; those who would risk all for that gold piece on that mast. Where will it end? Will no one stand up? It is the time for a flash mob to stand up. The Mahatma Ghandis, the Martin Luther Kings, the Patrick Henrys of us all to stand up and say give us the fight for life and liberty! And do not give us death through Global Warming and destruction and world chaos that is to come if we let the deniers and fearful lead on.
