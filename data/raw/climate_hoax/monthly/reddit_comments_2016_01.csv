I find it hilarious that this same obsession with email ""scandal"" is still rife today. Look at the recent NOAA emails that apparently show that ocean acidification is also a hoax. What a load of shit.","2016-01-09 22:36:18","2","Tommy27","1747753469.124929","climate hoax","manual"

I saw Lamar Smith's NOAA finishing trip, as a similar attempt to fuel denial in the run-up to Paris","2016-01-09 10:13:12","3","fungussa","1747753469.12867","climate hoax","manual"
"cyslluo","t3_403ntw","403ntw","climate","scientific","Climategate was a very effective public relations attack on climate science, make no mistake. These were coordinated pros, hacking secure servers, stealing thousands of emails, combing through them to find a few isolated phrases that could be quoted out of context, and then broadcasting them to the Web on the very eve of the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks. The fact that they were sent from Russia's most notorious FSB data center, used in other Russian cyber attacks, is all too consistent with the scope of this campaign. This was major parts of the global fossil fuel industry spiking Copenhagen...and it worked.","2016-01-10 05:12:31","3","Splenda","1747753469.1314619","climate hoax","manual"
