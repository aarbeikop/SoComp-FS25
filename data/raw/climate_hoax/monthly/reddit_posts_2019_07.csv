"chf3mh","climatechange","action-oriented","An effective copy-pasta, please test it out in arguments","An effective copy-pasta: I tried this on 5 different deniers and none of them had any good comeback for it. Yes it's a small sample size which is why I want more people to test it out. Please use it  anywhere and everywhere and then report back to see how effective it actually is.

Let’s say I am wrong and you are right, that AGW is a total hoax. What do we get if we treat it as if it's real? Cleaner air to breath? Cleaner water to drink? Less pollution in the world? People using a lot less gas, saving money from going to Saudi Arabia? More people employed by Solar, Wind and Renewable Energy than coal and gas? Less coal miners dying of black lungs? Less Exxon Valdez and Deep Horizon oil spills? What is so bad about that? But what if you are wrong and I am right, the world will be just as polluted today or worse. And we produce less food. Farmers in Ohio and the Mid West already planted 28% less corns and soy this year due to the flooding. What we are doing now is more important than ever. Join us.

These people need to know that we know who they are and who their children are. Their names will be stained for the short remainder of human history.","2019-07-15 09:37:24","77","24","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cdfdv6/someone_should_start_a_fund_to_erect_gigantic/","True","HankSteakfist","1747769710.9987588","climate hoax","manual"
