It may not be as hard as you think, since things like hot showers and clothes dryers waste huuuuge amounts and are mostly not necessary...","2015-10-25 16:07:23","6","IcelandicPopscicle","1747752438.2703512","climate hoax","manual"

What I think we are seeing though with this delusional hope for renewables, is the conservation of privilege. The snake oil salesmen & women of ""green"" energy are really fighting for the privileges afforded them by our oil based civilization.

"cwcljin","t3_3q59mz","3q59mz","collapse","skeptical","Yeah right. You want motion lotion, grow hemp and convert it to ethanol, grow and distill it locally to put in your transport of choice. Electric is not a problem, nor is heating, there is so much waste paper around to make fuel bricks to burn and oil drip heaters will run on used veggie oil. A 44 gallon oil drum rocket pizza oven is easy to make, this will stay hot for 24 hours, hot enough to cook a big family dinner","2015-10-25 21:01:50","2","Cybercommie","1747752438.27618","climate hoax","manual"
"cwck2zj","t3_3q59mz","3q59mz","collapse","skeptical","Actually I'm surprised more dirty fossil fuel production facilities are not adopting renewable energy infrastructure to reduce production and transportation costs.

Renewable energy is in effect nearly free once the infrastructure is up and running.  This could massively reduce overheads for production and transportation of fossil fuels.

If fossil fuel companies spend a barrel of oil to extract 10 then why not replace that dirty barrel of fossil fuel with clean/cheap renewable energy?","2015-10-25 20:24:24","0","Arowx","1747752438.278031","climate hoax","manual"
"cwcp0zs","t3_3q59mz","3q59mz","collapse","skeptical",">> We will have to replace all of today's solar-wind products during a time of extreme shortages in energy, food, water and minerals. 

Of course if you start with that assumption, you end with it. 

You can start with another assumption, that in 30 years we'll have fusion or decent nuclear working and our energy problems will be over. 

The result is probably somewhere in the middle.","2015-10-25 22:32:40","-1","[deleted]","1747752438.2797198","climate hoax","manual"
