"da8pxmi","t3_5e066c","5e066c","environment","emotional","Well, first of all, what are his arguments? Why does he not believe in it? There might be several ways to convince him. First of all, you may show him the articles of organizations that might deserve credibility (like NASA, for instance: http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ or that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change https://www.ipcc.ch/). Most scientists (over 90%, some say 97% or more, I do not know the exact figures) do agree climate change is real. If he has a different opinion, then show you are open to hear it and let him show his evidence. I find it hard to believe he will be able to indicate some solid articles about it and independent expert opinions of experts. But maybe he will, I am curious about it too, so let's see what he brings. 
To him, I guess, it is a hoax and a global conspiracy. Very well, then let's just think in terms of strategy. Who would be interested in affirming it's a hoax. Strangely, many climate change deniers are somehow involved in the oil business. It may be that they truly believe that climate change is a hoax, but their psychology does have a very solid reason to cherry-pick some facts (well look, it was actually quite cold THIS year, and it snowed here and there, and the ocean did not rise THAT much) in order to have the inner confirmation of their climate-hoax theory.
Then, if the ""voice of reason"" does not work, maybe he has reasons to deny it on an emotional level. I really do not know your father, but maybe, just maybe, he is enjoying his lifestyle and he does not want him or anyone else, for this matter, to change. Is he driving a highly polluting car? Is he eating a lot of meat? What if it just does not appeal to him to believe in it? What if he denies it for reasons that are not ""reasonable""? In this case, maybe you need to find out what stands behind his stubbornness. Again, I do not know him at all and this is all pure guessing. My point is that, in that case, you may be more successful not pushing on climate change, but showing that the ""green"" way can actually be economically lucrative and bring benefits related to health (he is not denying the toxicity of the exhaust gas and its influence on people's health too, is he?) Plus, look, even if climate change were not true, oil and coal will not last for too long. Maybe turning the country's investments to solar and wind energy will guarantee and smooth transition in a world that will need to move to those sooner or later.
I am writing all of these, but, to be honest, I have also met very skeptical people, calling all of it a hoax. I invited them to bring solid evidence and they couldn't, preferring to just close the subject. So I don't know how effective your endeavor might be. Keep me posted, I am curious.","2016-11-20 22:34:48","6","poussinbleu","1747757398.649611","climate hoax","manual"

Not sure where your father stands as regards politics and religion, but a safe bet may be to rephrase things in a way so as to make caring for the environment an act of stewardship, the sort of thing a strong father does to protect his children. 


Keep it small, keep it personal. 


Avoid the word 'global' if at all possible. 


Pull historical weather data for where you currently live, plus any regions he personally cares about.

"d9xk3tn","t3_5clowk","5clowk","environment","emotional","This is a great post; we as a public need to be vigilant, energetic, and active--the American way! Environmental organizations are at their most valuable during the tenure of environmentally hostile administrations and legislatures. I am desperately hoping that, at the end of the day, the public--regardless of political affiliation--remembers that clean air, clean water, and outdoor recreation are fundamentally important public health and economic issues. 

Because much of what is at stake is occurring at the national level (e.g. gouging EPA funding and funding for other ""green"" initiatives, including important economic drivers at the Department of Energy), it's worth considering the national-level environmental groups. [Sierra Club] (http://www.sierraclub.org/), [EarthJustice] (http://earthjustice.org/), [Natural Resources Defense Council] (https://www.nrdc.org/), and [Environmental Defense Fund] (https://www.edf.org/) are all very heavy and successful hitters that differ in method and approach. Check them out. Remember also that federal funding trickles down to many state programs.

And don't forget to write representatives at all political levels to remind them how important the environment is to public health and the economy. It's important to note that the EPA and other agencies/initiatives constitute such a small percentage of the federal budget but deliver enormous [economic benefits] (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/inforeg/2013_cb/draft_2013_cost_benefit_report.pdf).

Environmental policies have historically enjoyed support across party lines, and we ought to highlight this. Republicans at the very top may have recently removed themselves from meaningful discussion on these issues, and so a groundswell of support is needed.

"dakreqd","t3_5fhynk","5fhynk","collapse","skeptical","It doesn't originate from reddit. It's a new soft form of denial being rolled out by government spin doctors the world over. In addition there are calls for harsher penalties and fines for accidental ignitions and fire bylaw violations. This might even be happening on a subconscious level in some of these people. I have no quarrel that some particular fires may have been started by an arsonist, but so what? Arson is as old as man's use of fire and is but one of many human caused ignition sources. Is there something in the air that has started a global arson binge? No no no. AGW caused drought leading to AGW jacked wildfires. End of fucking story. That being said, you'll only see more denial and excuse making along with all the favorite rationalizations and whatever new ones the infinitely clever humans come up with. Here in BC we had a big time fire season in 2015 and there was a lame cigarette smokers scapegoat campaign and jacking up of fines. It was easy since smokers (not big tobacco or retail tobacco sellers) have been a societal scapegoat for over a decade. There are more people worried about second hand smoke than AGW & the well underway mass extinction. No use getting too angry or at least having any expectations that more science or consequences will force the humans to change their behaviour, because their reward seeking behaviour is hardwired by billions of years of evolution. The goodies will never be given up willingly. Only exhaustion/collapse or death will stop the techno industrial project. Probably going to see old timey religion make a comeback along with more techno utopian cargo cultism and neo Ghost Dancing. Even here on r/collapse there are still regular get out of jail free/going to Mars posts.","2016-11-29 17:37:00","9","[deleted]","1747757543.6998851","climate hoax","manual"
