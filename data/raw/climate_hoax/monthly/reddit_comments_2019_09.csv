Logical fallacy of argumentum ad hominem. ""You are wrong because of who you are"".

Every major science academy on Earth supports the IPCC's conclusions. The over whelming majority of IPCC authors are scientists.

A conspiracy theory. If the fundamentals of the science were false it would be simple to show, this is the same excuse creationists use about evolution.

In the UKJ your position in a university is payed for from the main university funds, the payscale is set so all academics of a similar role recieve the same funding. This again is a conspiracy theory.

All I can really say is that as others have pointed out, the disagreement with someone's science simply because of their position is...illogical. Good science is good science, regardless of the researchers label (ironically this is a point parroted by many folks who redistribute work from folks like Judith Curry and Alan Watts...even though those are prime examples a good scientist who left academia and someone who isn't exactly a working scientist). 

Beyond that...I think both sides of these debates need to consistently undergo bias checks. I do think (and this is entirely personal opinion) that one side seems more willing to do bias checks than the other. I also think there is a tendency to get ""into the weeds"" in some debates, and again as someone who is in the field I find this part the most frustrating; we spend years on a particular project, thinking deeply, questioning assumptions, running and re-running analyses to make sure we didn't miss something. Yet someone who spent an hour searching through the internet (likely through blog posts and opinion pieces that touch on science rather than primary literature) is an expert on radiative forcing. 

I get that science is a bit ivory tower sometimes. I hear and agree with all of the concerns that publishing is a rough, sometimes unethical landscape. But sadly I think whoever was pulling some strings with some early denier seeding has been successful in convincing a large swath of the public that essentially published academic science = bad and guerilla science = good. Maybe it's the quintessentially American concept of rebellious independence. Maybe it's money. Who knows. 

All we do know is: that the climate has always been changing...that's a given; causes of changes range from orbital eccentricities to geologic events; we will never know the true contribution (quantitatively) of humans to climate change, as it is much to complex to parse out single attributes; but/and we are undoubtedly having at least some effect based on a fundamental physical property of greenhouse gases...the very gases that give us a pleasant atmosphere...that's just basic physics. 

I would hope everyone could agree on those things. If not...well...some bias somewhere got into an internet echo chamber and off if went. 

This really is a difficult time to be in the field. Were damned if we do and damned if we don't (partake in the conversation). So we bury ourselves in our work and hope it speaks for itself. But then it doesn't in this era of science demonization. Or...sometimes worse...it gets misused by alarmists who take results out of context. Both sides are often wrong. And I sometimes wish we could go back to a time when science was science, and not some rallying cry for internet wars.

The threshold facts of climate change aren't affected by bias. As long as you start with proven facts, bias is a trivial issue. 

>IPCC are not scientists, they are politicians with a left and green agenda

It's best to describe IPCC as a bureaucratic process, and its reports have all the issues that committee-driven reports usually have. Although the IPCC is tasked with answering a question chosen by political appointees, so political influence isn't absent in the process. But again, the facts of climate change aren't subject to political influence. 

>Scientist working against AGW are silenced and their funds are cut.

This is just incoherent. This person has no idea about the astounding variety of ways in which research is supported. It's fair to say that research funds are probably scarce in climate science as a whole, compared to the vast resources needed to collect global datasets and produce global analyses. But in the free world, no single source or idea has a monopoly on how scientific research is supported. 

>These AGW-Scientists are biased because of their fund sources expecting certain outcomes. Unlike for example the Heartland Institute (or the German EIKE) that are telling the truth.

Again, facts are not subject to bias. These bias arguments are just trying to avoid confronting the facts.

>Your whole AGW-bubble just burst, as Dr. Mann lost in court. His hockey stick is now officially a fraud and he refuses to make his raw data and methods public.“

Court processes don't influence the reliability of facts either. Again this is an attempt to divert attention from the facts. 

>There is still no proof for AGW. They just fail to deliver one, probably because AGW is a hoax.

This is a much different, and stronger, argument to counter. Strong proof of AGW is going to take generations to assemble. Any skeptic who asserts that current evidence fails to reach a given standard of proof is standing on pretty solid ground.

Right now, the best evidence we have are correlations between human activity and climate change. The strength of these correlations has been mixed in the past, although it's possible to construct an argument that they're getting stronger now as more data is collected. That's probably about as far as I would go in countering a pretty-strong argument that ""proof"" of AGW is still an issue for the future, not really a present-day issue.    

>All this climate hysteria is just to come up with new taxes to rip the small citizens off their money.

It's definitely true that some politicians see climate change as an opportunity to shift financial and tax burdens in their societies, and ""hysteria"" probably is a tool in their arsenal. 

But time after time, these arguments amount to nothing more than attempts to evade pretty-simple facts which support a hypothesis that the climate is changing, in ways that are correlated with certain human activities. The facts are what matter. And they're easily accessible to everybody.  

People who deny facts are not engaging in reasoned debate, so reasoning with them probably is fruitless.","2019-09-06 15:37:52","1","DocHarford","1747770250.3714209","climate hoax","manual"

What is relevant is if the science is right or not. If the science is wrong, then demonstrate that.

If instead of demonstrating how the science is wrong, someone question the characters of the scientists or the trustworthiness of the IPCC, then that can be seen as an implicit admission that the science is fundamentally correct and cannot be successfully refuted. Why else try to shift the discussion away from the actual science?

One possible response to these statements is to ask if this means that the other party thinks the science is wrong and if so in what way and how he/she can demonstrate that? It would be fabulous, wonderful, amazing if it could be shown that the climate science is wrong! What a relief! Please, please convince me that the fundamentals of climate science is wrong!

The link you provide concerning the Mann v Ball case is typical of the slanted shit that the AGW community comes up with. Ball won that case fairly. He asked early on for it to be dismissed for several reasons but Mann would not allow that. He'd rather torture an octogenarian. Well, Mann got what was coming to him - a big loss plus exposure for not releasing his data to the court.  

In the ""climate-gate"" emails one fellow even asked for a copy of ""Mike's Nature trick"". He meant by that the fraudulent stats that Mann got past the reviewers.

Reduced volatility in resource markets (reduced international exploitation v. Resilient use) should also help alleviate abrupt changes that are used for leverage to further exploit populations.

Just from reading the title of the post I knew this would be about agenda 21.  I won't deny that certain things about that topic have been said by people in power.  However they said something like ""if things get really bad then we might have to do X or Y or Z to keep everyone alive.""  Then the conspiracy theorists decided that X and Y and Z is the Illuminati's unchangeable plan for humanity.

Here is the thing: anything can be used for oppression.  It depends on the society and if the society allows for the rise of an oppressive dictator.

You aren't going to see many outright bans.  Certain things will get more expensive either because they get scarce or because governments recognize them as damaging and tax them heavily.  Meat for example will never be banned.  But more on this in a bit.

You've heard the phrase ""The freedom to swing your fist stops at another person's nose.""  Over time population density rises and we develop more powerful tools that increase individual's agency and as science proves more interconnections.  This means that the reach of your punch gets further and more powerful.  And the other person's nose gets closer.  Changes to laws and regulations follow.  Is this oppression?

300 years ago if you wanted meat you went out and shot it.  Now gun ownership is more onerous and you have hunting seasons and hunting licenses and bag limits and tags.  Oppression!  No.  We've got more people and less wilderness and more powerful firearms and less wildlife and are aware of how we could ruin mating populations and drive animals to extinction.

You are going to see a lot more of that sort of thing.  It won't be reserved for the 1% and banned for everyone else.  Either the price will go up or it will be regulated down to sustainable levels.","2019-09-27 14:40:05","3","parametrek","1747770565.090167","climate hoax","manual"

Climate change, and the related energy predicament does present a special characteristic: everyone on earth will be playing the greatest game of musical chairs very soon.

 As our energy and ecological carrying capacity go down humans will have to adjust to live with less. Many people will make small adjustments well. Most will make large adjustments poorly. I expect the wealthiest among us will use their relative advantage to maintain that advantage at the expense of everyone and everything.

And let's allow that your city's sub is a representative sample - that *still* means you're going to be met with massive downvotes and resistance. As others have said here, climate change is more a problem of human psychology than technology. No matter how theoretically capable we are of solving the problem, most of us are psychologically incapable of even *entertaining* it, let alone accepting it, let alone researching it. Social conditioning is what we evolved to live our lives by, not the sciences (this is why we have peer review, because individually, we're not capable of being objective), and social conditioning says that the meaning of life is to gather stuff and reproduce.

So in consequentialist terms, we have, as a culture, defined ""adulthood"" as ""maximizing one's carbon footprint,"" and we actively punish people for deviating from that path. We accept people who don't have children, of course; as long as they're ""doing something,"" (defined, obviously, in economic, and therefore carbon-intensive, terms).

So faced with that, one can fall into a depression, or one can cultivate a certain amount of cynicism; just enough to make peace with it and try to live a decent little life. It's still possible, but increasingly I'm finding that I need to be around people who aren't Living the Big Lie^(TM), at least in terms of my immediate social group.
