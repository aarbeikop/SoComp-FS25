I recommend you stop debating for a few days and take any spare time to read environmental news on a daily basis, such as on the Guardian(recommended) or just Google news on climate action and climate change effects etc...

You should refer to climate.nasa.gov , search TED-ED on how the greenhouse effect works(How Quantum mechanics proves global warming), read the IPCC 1.5 Special 2018 report, natgeo’s videos, YouTube videos(why the IPCC report is so scary)....and follow news on effects such as wildfires, heatwaves etc

Regarding how to face climate denial, please search potholer54’s YouTube channel, especially rebuttals. The main problem is that people say what they think the evidence proves rather than what it actually says.

I think the most damning argument is not that climate change is not real .. but it is that we are going to fail to rein it in.

Otherwise just show the many historical graphs on weather data all over the world, how they all look the same or almost the same... show how govs cannot fake data because it wouldn't look the same to other data sets.
Finnally, show the increase in temperature anomalies that have been increasing for the last 50 years.  Show sea level rising, show academic studies, etc...

https://skepticalscience.com/

if you want to see actual science, realclimate.org but that's going to be above you I would suggest.

I am not sure why you want to use science to convince your stepfather, it will leave you frustrated ? He didn't get into this position by using deductive reasoning, critical thinking and evidence. He formed an opinion and found others of a like mind and refuted any experts who disagree.

In paraphrasing Bertrand Russel

1. Be sceptical, 
2. if the experts are divided on the outcomes, remain sceptical
3. If the majority of the experts in the field agree on an outcome and you're NOT an expert, accept their findings.  If you don't, you're an idiot.

You're stepfather is at 3.  More data and science won't help and is likely to lead to nothing but arguments (you can't debate with idiots, it's like playing chess with a Pidgeon, they walk around knocking pieces over, take a shit and fly away thinking they have won).  

See here for some research on why you will make it worse
