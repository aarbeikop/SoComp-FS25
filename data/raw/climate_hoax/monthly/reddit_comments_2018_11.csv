"eagn8dg","t3_a00nr0","a00nr0","climatechange","action-oriented","There are four broad classes of belief about climate change:

1. It isn't happening. 

2. It's happening but not because of us. 

3. It's happening because of us, but it's not a priority. 

4. It's happening because of us, and it needs to be a priority.

Don't invest any energy you can't afford to lose on 1 and 2. Turning 3s into 4s will be enough to make things happen.","2018-11-25 21:42:07","4","ASigIAm213","1747766048.2765062","climate hoax","manual"

"eae6tq7","t3_a00nr0","a00nr0","climatechange","action-oriented","Calling them a troll and saying you want to asault them is not a good way to start.

You no doubt want to be able to put your point forward and excluding both extremes, so do they.

The climate is complex and there must be genuine debate to progress factual understanding of the complexity. You should ignore ones who have all the answers and know what the future holds. 

Don't base the validity of an argument on whether it agrees with your currently held belief. 

A good place to start is the Grand Solar Minimum debate currently emerging. Their seems to be a lot of momemtum being generated in the media promoting catastrophic cooling as a consequence. Have a look on youtube. However, l have ignored these and discovered some good balanced proposals from credible people arguing the effects of reduced solar activity. These being remotely different to the media hype. I'm undecided but look forward to how the effects will be observe in the short term ie within the next decade rather than century or millenia.","2018-11-24 23:15:22","2","NewyBluey","1747766048.282552","climate hoax","manual"

"eafcyut","t3_a00nr0","a00nr0","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm an AGW skeptic who agrees with you. AGW is a politicized issue and as such attracts commentators whose only education on the issue comes from their own preferred sources. It's a problem on both sides of the debate. We have ""skeptics"" who are as ill-informed as believers. 

We've seen many articles complaining that people won't listen to AGW warnings any more. That should not surprise given the sheer number of blogs dedicated to pushing the ideas generated by the scientific illiteracy of the authors. Failed predictions by AGW proponents catch up so that we have the ""chicken-little"" situation we have today. Poorly trained ""skeptics"" who fail to understand *why* a prediction failed, yet see fit to crow about it, do just as much damage to the skeptic case.   

You express frustration over some poor representatives, but we skeptics have the same complaint. The sheer number of utter fools who continue to argue when contrary evidence is right in front of their faces is hard to take some times.

Not all climate scientists believe that climate change is caused by man so it's not so wrong for them to side with those scientists.  Personally I haven't seen any evidence, other than incidental, that it has been caused by man.  There have been times when it was warmer and the CO2 levels were lower and vice-versa.
