"bit8al","climatechange","action-oriented","Honest skeptic here looking for answers.","Hi, I’m what some consider to be a “lukewarmer”, or climate agnostic. (Criteria I use: I tend to think the science is strongest for an RCP range of 3-6 not 8.5, and ECS range of 2-4) 

Unfortunately I’ve found that challenging *any* report (whether scientific, science-y, ideological media, or Hollywood movie star) on climate catastrophe, I’m often shouted down as a “denier”. 

I honestly,politely and in an open minded way, seek for answers to the truth that lies between “global warming is a hoax” and “humankind on earth has 12 years to go before certain apocalypse”

For what it’s worth, I do believe that man plays a significant role in global warming and individuals and governments need to act. 

Are there any topics in the above spectrum that *are* open to discuss without being labeled a denier?","2019-04-29 18:56:49","6","41","0.71","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bit8al/honest_skeptic_here_looking_for_answers/","True","jefemundo","1747768140.609024","climate hoax","manual"
"bhdeab","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm interested in informing a climate skeptic. Any suggestions?","Hi all,

I'm an environmental science student and my bf recently told me about a weird interaction he had with a friend. His friend said he believes climate change is a hoax, mainly based on information he's gotten from a guy named Dan Peña, who endorses Donald Trump and appears to have some kind of vested interests in supporting the longevity of the fossil fuel industry and lobbying against the development of clean energy (though I haven't found anything directly tying him to it at this point).

I'm looking for good material that debunks Peña's outlandish claims about the ""climate change hoax"", but I can't seem to find any videos of direct responses to Peña's claims that would be easily understood by someone with little understanding of climate science. I find that showing skeptics research papers and statistics never really changes their views, so I want to try an approach that would work better for this type of person. 

Can anyone point me in the direction of some interesting, stimulating, maybe funny videos that debate climate skeptics, that I can use to sway this denier to see the evidence instead of just making him feel overwhelmed/belittled by dumping a bunch of statistics on him? Also, if anyone can help me find any evidence that points out possible conflicts of interest between Dan Peña and his vehement climate change denial, that would be very helpful!

Thank you all so much in advance!","2019-04-25 20:23:31","2","12","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bhdeab/im_interested_in_informing_a_climate_skeptic_any/","True","throwaway136900","1747768163.9874198","climate hoax","manual"
"bdnk2e","climatechange","action-oriented","Powerful and easy to understand visualizations of various effects of climate change?","I am presenting a 30 minute piece on the ethics of climate change in my ethics course but want to quickly nail in damning information to prevent my sheltered Utahn student peers from just rejecting the entire notion of climate change as Utah Valley has conservatively been convinced that it's a hoax/myth, and my report will go over their head within minutes since they won't even care. I want to quickly show them the effects in my background slides in convincing ways that are easy for them to realize the massive effects that are happening. The spiral gif of yearly increases in temperature [https://video.twimg.com/tweet\_video/DalyUtyVAAM5lre.mp4](https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/DalyUtyVAAM5lre.mp4) is particularly good, and was wondering what other potential resources I could utilize and show my class to help prove my point. If this isn't allowed feel free to delete, but I figured the Reddit community would potentially be particularly helpful.

"b81rix","environment","emotional","Disproving the “global warming hoax”","So, my very scientifically minded grandfather (engineer) and I have been having a lot of discussions about greenhouse gasses, specifically CO2. I’ve mentioned choral bleaching, and the other greenhouse gasses that we should be genuinely concerned about (methane, water vapor, etc.), but he likes to keep fixating on the idea that CO2 is not bad for the environment ([video he showed me for reference])(https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fA5sGtj7QKQ), and that it’s all one big hoax. I did some research on the internet, but couldn’t find recent good research on HISTORIC global temperature changes.  On a fundamental level, I know climate change is an issue, and all the real world impacts, but it’s hard to impress the urgency of the situation when he doesn’t believe in the problem to begin with.  If one of you, noble environmentalists, who has a good understanding of the scientific resources that exist on the subject would be willing to share, I would greatly appreciate it!  Or if you just want to rant about the downstream effects, this is a really important topic to me, and getting an opportunity to bring another into the fold is really meaningful to me!

"bh60hp","collapse","skeptical","Let us Consider Our Sins","Many of the uncomfortable truths that we are willing to post about on here cause people to question their belief in God.  Climate change is combated as a hoax, or enemy propaganda.  

Is there a way to reach the faithful without destroying their faith?  

How do people cope with the fear of end times, instilled in them since childhood?

How much of the blame for the futility of preventing collapse can be laid at the feet of our religious institutions?

&#x200B;

>The truth is man’s disobedience to  God and his commandments are the cause of fearful weather events, a  reminder from him that we are living in “the perilous end times.” People  are lovers of money, boastful, proud; and disobedient to parents,  police and teachers; gossipers, haters of good, lovers of pleasure  rather than God. God said in the last days of earth there will be great  earthquakes, floods, roaring of the seas, plagues, famines, terrors,  terrorists and great signs from heaven in the sun, moon and stars. Next  time one of God’s little lightning bolts strikes and the thunder rattles  your house, think about Him. **There is no Mother Nature**, and no human  controls weather events. God is the one with a storehouse of wind, rain,  snow, lightning, hailstones and calamities at His disposal and all  these are to make people consider their sins, repent and surrender their  lives to him.
