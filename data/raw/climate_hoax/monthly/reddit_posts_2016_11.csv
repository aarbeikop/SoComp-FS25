I bet him to match me on Peer reviewed info-graphics and journals, help me find some.","He believes that its a joke and ""all those scientist are paid off."" Not like the Fossil Fuel companies are paying a huge chunk of Congress/Senate right?

So i told him to match me on peer reviewed scientific journals and info-graphics.

He believes that solar panels and wind turbines would do more harm to wildlife than Oil and Gas already do... no im not joking.

It disheartens me to know he thinks like this and I would be glad to change his mind, because it's not a fucking joke.

"5fiut4","environment","emotional","How can I deal with the fear of climate change?","Hello r/environment! I’m about to sound like a paranoid lunatic (hence the throwaway), but I have an ongoing problem where I feel totally overwhelmed and afraid when I think about climate change. I do things in my life to try and make a small impact to help – I recycle as much as possible, I’m cutting back on eating meat, I’m trying to reduce my waste and water usage – but no matter what I do in my life, the fossil fuel industry is still ravaging the planet. And they have no intention of stopping. To top it off, my country just elected an idiotic, climate-change-denier as our next President! Not that I think Clinton would have done much to help either, but at least she doesn’t refer to climate change as a “hoax” started by China.  

I try to think about the future, even 10 years from now, and I have no idea what the world will be like. I hope that we’ll pull our shit together and start working hard to fix this, but I don’t want to hope and be wrong, so I’m trying to prepare myself for the worst possible scenario. I feel like the life I’m living now won’t be around in 10 years. When will food and fresh water become scarce? When will we lose Louisiana and Florida? I’ve always wanted to have kids, but I don’t want to anymore because I don’t want to bring children (who didn’t ask to be born) into a world that holds no opportunity for them. I think about the things that I’m working toward in my life now and when I think about the future, I suddenly think, “What’s the point?” 

I’m going through my daily life and I’m happy, but I have this giant, heavy cloud hanging over my head. I’ve been reading articles that show the devastating effects that climate change is already having on our planet, and it’s going to get worse before it gets better, if it ever does. What if we do finally get our shit together and it’s too late? 

Before you ask or suggest, yes, I’m in therapy for anxiety, but this is one of those issues where it feels like no matter how relaxed I may feel in therapy, this shit is still happening. Just because I feel a little better about it doesn’t mean that anything is going to change. I can go to therapy and feel better afterward but Trump is still becoming our next President and is threatening to break apart the EPA and is filling his cabinet with ultra-conservative climate-change-deniers. 

Does anyone see any hope for our planet? Has anyone else been feeling like this? How do you deal with it? 

TLDR: I’ve been really scared lately of climate change/future for our planet. Does anyone see any hope? Does anyone else feel this way? How do you deal with it?

"5clowk","environment","emotional","Grassroots Environmental Movements Are The Last Line Of Defense For The Next 4 Years, At Least. Who Do You Work With?","I think anyone even remotely concerned about the realities of a rapidly changing environment had a heart sinking realization after this last election. As was his most recent stated position, president-elect Trump believes global warming is a Chinese hoax, and he has suggested a cartoonishly villainous lineup of climate change deniers to head up some of the most important government agencies safeguarding the country against environmental abuses. With conservatives firmly in control of all branches of government going forward, the need for companies and grassroots organizations to step up and demand action is greater now more than ever. 

What can we do about it? First and foremost, volunteer and donate.

Personally, I am helping to start up a non-profit that's putting artificial wetlands in the Chicago River to recover vital habitat lost to a century of damage to the river and it's ecosystem, done by industrialization [Urban Rivers](http://urbanriv.org). We've put a lot of work into this, and thanks in large part to some progressive companies (Whole Foods, Patagonia, and Kayak Chicago in particular) and well as Chicago itself and other local governmental agencies, we're 23 days of a kickstarter away from launching the first part of an incredible project that could get people to fall in love with, and care about their environment again.

The organizations are out there, and the will is out there, but we need to work together to put up maximum resistance. We've worked with some other great non-profits like [The Wetlands Initiative](http://wetlands-initiative.org) and [Friends of the Chicago River](http://chicagoriver.org). Local and national organizations big and small now need everyone more than ever. The [Climate Science Defense Fund](http://climatesciencedefensefund.org/) is going to be working overtime for the next 4 years, guaranteed. Keep in mind, small organizations feel the budget pinch much harder than big ones sometimes, so don't forget your local orgs too.

Does anyone else work with environmental organizations they would like to give a shout out to? I can tell you with certainty that these groups appreciate any support at any time, no matter how big or how small. It might be corny, but right now, it really is up to us. Who do you give your support to?

"5doqiq","environment","emotional","Letter to President-Elect Trump","Dear Mr. President Elect,


If you are arrogant enough to think that climate change will not affect you and your family, you are sadly mistaken. As temperatures rise so do the tensions between countries and peoples forced to compete for increasingly scarce resources. Barack Obama has said that it is this that makes global climate change a threat to our national security. A good example is Syria, a nation whose civil war and instability is seen by many scientists as a direct result of climate change and as an omen of more to come.

As our nation’s president, it will be your responsibility to maintain good relations with the countries and peoples affected, the majority of which had very little if anything to do with the pollution that led to climate change in the first place, and to help create solutions not only for the American population, but for the whole human species. By deregulating our fossil-fuel industry, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, and defunding the UN’s initiatives, you are endangering my personal safety, my parent’s safety, and the safety of all life on this planet. You are robbing the United States of its long-held title of the “leader of the free world” and greatly reducing our global hegemony. 

I strongly believe that the only path forward is, first and foremost, to revise your first hundred days in office and stay true to all of the regulations and commitments put in place by the Obama administration. If only this were enough, but sadly there is more; you must put a carbon tax in place -- creating incentive for corporations and consumers to produce/buy sustainable products. You must create a plan for the United States to be completely independent from fossil-fuels by 2030, and severely limit, if not ban outright, contributions made by fossil-fuel interests to politicians. I know this is hard for you to stomach, as your entire campaign was funded by these same villains that you now must liberate our country from, but it will be worth it. I know that all you have ever wanted is to be hailed as a golden god, and you may just have your wish (at least among the millennials) if you can find the gall to stand up to the men that shaped you from the primordial tar with which they control us.

Even if you are a reptilian hybrid set on warming the planet to make it more hospitable for your masters, which I’m definitely not ruling out, isn’t there a way that we could all coexist? Can’t we compromise on a 1 degree warmer planet? Or do the reptilian overlords require every polar bear to be drowned, every coral reef bleached, before they can bare to return to our Earth’s surface. What place would yours and Melania’s spawn hold in a reptilian world? I know how you feel about minorities, so why would you wish that fate upon yourself and your children? 

And so I ask, I beg, please help, if not for me, then for the future of your children. Tell your vengeful cold blooded sovereigns to take a hike and make history by being the single most important human-being to ever live. At the very least just acknowledge out loud what you must have known for decades -- that climate change is not a hoax, and that we are all depending on major global reform to steer us away from oblivion. 


Sincerely frightened,

Yeah Reddit. I bet those arsonists where Chinese agents. These fires has nothing to do with unprecedented extreme drought. And if it is the drought this has nothing to do with climate change. And if it has to with climate change it isn't man made. And if it is man made it is impossible to do anything about it because it's too late to do anything. Praise the lord Gatlinburg voted 80% for a guy who is going to find these Chinese arsonists and stop them from perpetuating this climate change HOAX.","2016-11-29 10:30:29","6","5","0.59","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5fhynk/gatlinburg_burns_to_the_ground_and_reddit_blames/","True","TrumpWillRuleEarth","1747757542.543981","climate hoax","manual"
