In any stable, comparable nation, has the cost of living ever increased at the rate that it has increased within the last 2 decades in the U.S.? I'm 39 and I've seen a drastic increase in the cost of living since I was 19. I'm just wondering it this is par for the course in any stable economy? I know it's a hard question because the nations have never existed or endured what they are now enduring.","2019-11-11 01:49:13","1","sweet_home_Valyria","1747774245.557662","climate hoax","manual"
