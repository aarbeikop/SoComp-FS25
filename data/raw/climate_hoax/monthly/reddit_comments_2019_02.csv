Are you doomed? No. Doomed implies that there is no chance of redemption or survival. That is simply not the case. 

Are you right to be worried? Yes. Things are dire and significant loss is inevitable. Many of the comforts and conveniences our elders enjoyed will be gone. We will bear witness to human suffering and devastation of wildlife. And, complete catastrophe is possible. 

Please do not succumb to despair. There is still a lot to live and fight for, and we need you in this fight. This a critical moment in history. The actions we take now will shape the trajectory of civilization and life itself. Turning this ship around will require the effort and engagement of every person who understands what's at stake. 

We need to crush capitalism, patriarchy, and the myth of perpetual growth. We need to support science, sufficiency, and community. The only way to make this happen is to stay engaged. Put pressure on corporations and elected officials. You'll be eligible to vote in another year, right? Be registered. Register your peers. Start contacting officials and candidates now. Let them know this issue is non-negotiable for young voters. Vote with your wallet and your fork, too. Be a discriminate consumer. Buy as little as necessary and patronize the least offensive businesses. Use social media to shame the most vile. We have to clobber them, and we can't do that if we are under the covers wallowing in despair. When you have spare money, or when somebody asks what you want for your birthday, consider requesting donations to climate activist organizations. Use the leverage you have to build the future you deserve. 

We must have courage, even if we don't have hope. ","2019-02-01 15:45:07","1","[deleted]","1747767352.2996","climate hoax","manual"
