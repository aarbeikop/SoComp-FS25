"3q59mz","collapse","skeptical","Alternative Energy Requires Cheap Oil","Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben are lying to you about energy.
When they say that Germany gets 40% of their electricity from ""renewable"" energy, they are not being honest. 

That 40% number only includes electrical generation, and not the total energy consumed. German diesel cars burn palm and soy oils imported from the Amazon and Indonesia. The Germans call these oils ""bio-fuels"", like it's a good thing, and they also lie about the emissions their diesel cars give off. 

The 40% number also only includes the sunniest and windiest times of the day. Because solar and wind are intermittent sources of energy, it would take 10 times their rated power to close one fossil fuel plant that runs 24/7. This means we would need 10 megawatts of solar-wind power to close a 1 megawatt coal fired power plant. Wind turbines only produce 25% of their rated power output 90% of the time. If you place the palm of your hand on a solar panel, its efficiency drops 80%.

50% of Northern Europe's ""renewable"" energy comes from burning wood pellets to produce electricity. These wood pellets are imported from all over the world, including Indonesia, the Amazon, Russia and even the U.S.A. The international black market for wood products is likely nearly as large as the officially recognized market.

The European carbon credit scam is so filled with fraudulent loopholes that it pays polluters to pollute more and not less, as was intended.

The deployment of renewable energy is so resource intensive that after 20 years of trying, renewable energy has increased from 1% of total energy demand to all the way up to 3% of total energy demand. If we were to redouble our efforts, in another 20 years we may reach 7-11% of total energy demand.

The life-cycle for solar and wind products is less than 30 years. We will have to replace all of today's solar-wind products during a time of extreme shortages in energy, food, water and minerals. Recycling their component alloys requires more energy and expense than mining for them costs in the first place.

Most people deny climate chaos. Most people deny our energy trap. Most people deny our imminent, ongoing mass extinction. Most people only see lions and tigers on the television or at the zoo. There are more Siberian tigers in zoos than there are in the actual wilderness. Most people are totally fucking clueless about reality. If you think 8 billion people are going to stop eating meat and wasting food just to save all life on earth, then you are so totally fucking delusional that you probably think Naomi Klein is great. She is a sophomoronic media cow. In 20 years, we will be lucky to not have to eat humans to survive.
