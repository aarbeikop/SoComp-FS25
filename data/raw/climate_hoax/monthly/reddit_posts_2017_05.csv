"695e22","climate","scientific","Can/has anyone replied to these skepticisms??","This was virtually the first thing to come up when googling ""climate change hoax"". I'm a fairly open-minded man, and always like to see what's going on in the world of people i dont really agree with. Even I know some of these are/could be ""debunked"" (1,2, and 7, specifically), but i'd like to know if there's anyone with enough expertise in this area to orchestrate an in-depth rebuttal of, for example, the ""peer-reviewed"" studies dailywire cites. 

Do these skeptics truly have a leg to stand on, or are they grasping at fabricated straws??

5. There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years. 

6. The left likes to claim that 97 percent of scientists support the concept of man-made climate change. It's likely closer to 43 percent

7. The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high

8. Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists
