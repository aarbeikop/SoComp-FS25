"a00nr0","climatechange","action-oriented","How can I better fight the trolls out there who deny climate change exists?","I've been fighting with some trolls on Facebook for a couple days on the issue. It hasn't mattered one bit the amount of actual data I share or explain. It hasn't mattered that I've disproven their hoax charts or called put the ""scientists"" names they drop, all of which have been creationism pushers.

All I get from these trolls is ""Are you denying the Earth has never warmed and cooled?"" over and over. I can't take it anymore. The only thing that keeps me from smacking them in their face is the fact we're talking through the internet. I honestly think if I encountered one of these types of people IRL I'd have a hard time not throwing something at them.","2018-11-24 18:07:53","11","18","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/a00nr0/how_can_i_better_fight_the_trolls_out_there_who/","True","Radi0ActivSquid","1747766046.129621","climate hoax","manual"

The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has released a special report on the predicted impacts of anything more than 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in the atmosphere from pre-industrial averages. Earth could reach this bench mark as early as 2040 if current emission trends go untouched (Davenport, 2018). We would experience food shortages, wildfires, heatwaves, raised water levels, and extreme harm to fragile organisms and ecosystems like coral reefs (Davenport, 2018). How optimistic can we be in our ability as Americans to do our part? I would say extremely, but just like any political issue, but parties have good intentions, just different strategies. 

First things first, Republicans are not “Climate Change Deniers.” Only 9% of Republicans don’t believe in climate change (ClearPath, 2015). If we let single digits define an entire party, then the Democratic Party could be the Party of “The Moon Landing was a Hoax” (Griggs, 2009). But to many, Republicans might as well be deniers because they don’t think a top-down solution is the best way to save the Earth. The conservative take on environmentalism is deeply embodied in principles of entrepreneurialism, libertarianism, localism, and laissez-faire. As young Americans, the most climate conscience demographic in America (Funk, 2018), enter the world of political activism, it is important to promote free market values. Failing to learn the history of strong government regimes and socialism will doom us to repeat the past. 

What does a conservative mean by a hands-off government? They mean letting the invisible hand pick the winners and losers. Between Federal and State subsidies and tax breaks, the oil, coal, and gas industries receive over 20 billion dollars a year in corporate welfare (Redman, 2017). This is not only unnecessary, but deeply opposes free market principles. What about the government’s relationship with renewable energy production such as solar? They should keep their hands off this as well. The number of rules and regulations imposed on solar energy is very troubling in an age of progress. For anyone interested in installing residential solar panels, they must wade through a sea of red tape. (Pearce, 2016). The government should be making it as easy as possible for consumers to choose their energy sources. Solar panels can be very lucrative investments for an average household. But because of bureaucratic paperwork, the transaction costs of solar becomes higher than consuming fossil fuel energy from the grid. In addition to staying out of the consumers way when it comes to making environmentally conscience decisions, there is one more thing they can actively do. And that is invest in infrastructure. Presenting its citizens with an even playing field to compete is one of the most important roles of any government. The grid is basically a market place for energy, and limiting only utilities the ability to bring supply to those that demand it is crony-capitalism. The grid should be improved to allow even the smallest household, with even the smallest solar panel or windmill to feed energy to the market place. If a household had the ability to not only sustain themselves, but profit from a solar panel, a rational household where the principal investment would impose a low enough burden on income would do so. The increased supply would drive prices down. Unable to profit like they could at these new prices, fossil fuel generators would have to downsize operations, producing less dirty energy and, therefore, less emissions. This simple thought experiment doesn’t even take into account how an increased demand for residential solar panels would affect R&D investments into the technology of these panels themselves. 

As I said before, there are too many young people today possessing an unwarranted romanticism for socialism and a belief that a powerful central government is always the answer. I think it is important to explain to them why half the nation agrees with President Ronald Reagan when he said, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help’” (1986). The two main concerns are duel-sides of the same coin. The government shouldn’t do stuff for us, and it shouldn’t prevent us from doing stuff for ourselves. The former has a more behavioral element, the latter more of a moral quandary. The question often posed is, why shouldn’t the government control the power plants, they will be pollution conscience while not having stockholders for whom to grow profits? Well, the problem with this logic is that humans seldom thrive without incentives. Imagine a group of executives and their employees who are responsible for energy generation, however, because they are public sector, they have no skin in the game. No matter how cost efficient they are, they reap no benefits. No matter how cost inefficient they are, they can’t feel the pain because of the bottomless piggybank that a tax and spend system promotes.  Perhaps half the nation doesn’t trust the concept of a top down planner for the economy because many see politicians as nothing more than those road workers that take 10 weeks to fill a pot hole, and who needs slow ineffective road repairers with a god complex. Secondly, we can ask a more basic question. Why do humans deserve freedom? Of course, we can all agree that any form of nonconsensual control over a human by another goes against everything that we know to be just and true. But we undeniably have social contracts. How is holding someone behind bars different than preventing someone from buying a big gas-guzzler that the government has deemed unacceptable?  The criminal is a threat to society, but only when it is proven beyond doubt. Conservatives don’t think that someone should be anointed as the decider of what is allowed and dictate a standard to which all must abide. That brings into question ulterior motives and conflicts of interest. Everyone wants to save the world, and conservatives genuinely believe we don’t need to sacrifice our freewill to do so.

I think the best way to conclude is with some common ground. In June 2017, President Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord. Obviously, this decision was not bipartisan, but the next steps taken by climate change activists was. Americans Pledge is a collection of states, cities, businesses, universities, and citizens working to participate in the Paris Accord without the Federal Government (Americans Pledge, 2018). While some see this as plan B, conservatives see this as plan A. The localization of power increases the accuracy of government action to the desires of constituents. Contacting local government should be the new normal when it comes to activism.

Lastly, as Young Americans move forward with their lives, I urge them to do a few simple things. Realize that those that disagree with you are not inherently unintelligent, immoral, or both. And to disapprove of your proposed solution is not a denial of the existence of the problem.
