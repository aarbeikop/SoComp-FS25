He called global warming a hoax, and I learned that stuff in high school. Everyone knows it is real, how can one take him seriously? Or so I thought. But after studying a bit more, I am not sure how to reconcile these observations:

1) The current CO2 ppm are at around 400. Below 250, plants start to suffer significantly. CO2 is crucial to life.

2) 400 million years ago, CO2 ppm were over 6000. Back then, the Earth was full of life already.

3) It is hard to find good data on CO2 volatility in ppm, but it appears to fluctuate over time a fair amount.

4) Water vapor is more impactful as a greenhouse gas than CO2. And most people would prefer the stable temperatures of a sea climate (much water vapor) to inland desert climate (little water vapor). The desert climate simply fluctuates too much for people. So it seems that CO2 also has this stabilizing effect. 

5) Ice ages are manifested when the sun is relatively inactive. When the sun gets more active, the Earth, as well as other planets in vicinity, heat up. This component has a lot more impact than on the temperature than any greenhouse gas. Which is kind of obvious actually, since virtually all warmth on the surface of Earth comes from the sun.

These observations definitely seem to impact my thinking. If you can comment on any of these points, please stay with facts and reliable sources rather than plain conclusions. It would be nice if this thread could stay clean and professional. Help with figuring this out would be much appreciated :)","2019-05-16 13:42:40","0","13","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bpcpel/lets_discuss_facts_help_out_the_open_minded_like/","True","Crimson_Fire_Apples","1747768639.806367","climate hoax","manual"

This article (above) actually worried me a bit, in that there is such a mass of misinformation and even material being pushed from oil companies and the like, expressing that climate change is a hoax.","2019-05-16 06:39:52","3","0","0.72","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bp96dr/education_and_climate_change/","True","shelbymann","1747768720.263028","climate hoax","manual"
"btvbq3","collapse","skeptical","Crop Losses Globally Continue to Mount","So far we are looking at the lowest planting ever recorded for corn and soy in the USA, Australia now a net importer of wheat for the first time ever and the Ural Mountains are behind in wheat planting as well. I'm focused on the Grand Solar Minimum as the reason for the losses, and if its happening this early into the intensification, I wonder how steep the losses will get. Anyone else have a thought on the crop losses?","2019-05-28 03:48:30","0","15","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/btvbq3/crop_losses_globally_continue_to_mount/","True","Oilseedcrops","1747768857.145335","climate hoax","manual"
