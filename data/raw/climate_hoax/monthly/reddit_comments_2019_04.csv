* The value of ECS and the timescale for an equilibrium temperature.
* The feedback effects from clouds.
* Regional changes in precipitation. 

The above are active areas of research in the field, and you shouldn't be labelled a denier for raising them.

The areas of least uncertainty:

* The theoretical basis for GHG warming.
* The globe has warmed since pre-industrial times from GHGs, and will continue to warm under our likely emission pathways.
* If GHGs concentrations were held constant, the globe would continue to warm for many decades as oceans warm slowly.
* If GHG emissions completely stopped, GHG concentrations would drop as they are absorbed by land and ocean sinks.

The last point shows the problem is solvable.","2019-04-29 20:32:47","13","e_large","1747768143.34675","climate hoax","manual"

You can't really expect to find much substantive debate on climate except in places where there's a strong bias toward analytic methods and properly-supported assertions. That isn't many places.

By the end of the LIA people had mastered more efficient mining and manufacturing techniques based on steam power. Steam power made it possible to drill for oil which then impelled the development of the gas engine and so on. People were on track for a huge change in technology and the benefits of it. 

Humans are no different from any other animals which take advantage of local resources to breed  With the end of the LIA even those places not touched by technology saw an improvement in local conditions. As technology spread population increased more rapidly yet. Over the course of 100 years the human population went from 1B to 7B. Every one of those people produces heat just from daily living, and their new technologies produce much of that heat. 

The temperature of Earth has risen a mere 0.8C in 100 years. Despite the fact that the LIA ended, and that both human population and our technology has expanded, the rise is still less than 1C.  

I made note of this just recently: [Here is a graph](http://woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1970/to:2015/mean:12/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1975/to:1988/mean:12/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1989/to:2015/mean:12/trend) showing the temperature trend from the first rise in temperature up to Hansen's testimony, and what has gone on since. Note that there is no difference in slope.

Essentially, no underwriter would back investments in real estate development near the coast. 

So rather than trying to dig up shit on Pena, address the argument. If I were going to have that discussion with someone, I would look at projected rates of SLR. It's presently about one foot per century. IIRC, AR5 suggested one meter by 2100. The problem is that the media is generally all over more extreme projections, without disclosing that those are much less likely.

From there, look at how high above sea level RE developments are. Then, look at breakeven for investors in terms of years. You should be informed enough by then to have the discussion.","2019-04-26 01:34:24","2","Will_Power","1747768166.125369","climate hoax","manual"

2. Your disdain for your classmates, if not already known, will be readily apparent in your presentation. As soon as it is, nothing you say or do will be taken seriously by your classmates. The world already has plenty of misanthropic climate activists. What would really be refreshing would be a person who genuinely cared for their audience.

"elqxaku","t3_bh60hp","bh60hp","collapse","skeptical","Religion means we can never have common ground. Since religion is not objective and does not adapt in core ways, it's constantly reinterpreted to serve the ends of existing power structures. That's how the powers-that-be use religion - as population control. We are stuck with perpetual conflict as long as we have religion.

Want faith? You don't need it. Realize that you are the Universe itself - part of a pantheon of entities that come into awareness. Realize you are a vessel of the Universe's awareness of itself. This is an astounding idea that identifies what is most amazing about existence, and it doesn't just provide you common ground with most people - but most conscious intelligence the Universe can manifest (with technical caveats I'm not going into).

So, if the bible is true, then follow Jesus and stop worrying.

If it's not true, then nothing matters, in any way. Absolutely nothing. 

Good news: the bible is true. So follow Jesus.","2019-04-25 12:30:55","-2","samsoldit","1747768461.349925","climate hoax","manual"
