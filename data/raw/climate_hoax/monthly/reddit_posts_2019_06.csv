"c2q9l4","climatechange","action-oriented","Can someone provide me with a primer?","Hello, I am new to the sub and joined because my whole family (uncles, aunts, parents) are very pro-oil and refuse to look at any evidence supporting climate change. All they can really say is ""It's A Scam"" ""Its a Hoax"" ""Propaganda"". The problem I am having is I really want to challenge them on this, but unlike me they are all fairly well educated and generally debate politics quite frequently and I do not, this makes me very confident and fearful of a confrontation. So I want to educate myself so that way when I am challenged back I can have something intellectual to say and can defend my position.

Pretty much most conversations for me and them have been online, they generally post a viral copy paste about the previous mentioned. Then I immediately start researching the author of there article to validate credibility, If no credibility can be found I inform them it is not a creditable source. Siting my references, or posting to research papers that I can find from such places as the IOP. But diving this deep is currently my only recourse, I don't have enough information in reserve to actual have a live conversation and I want to remedy this.

Help me Reddit-wan-kenobi, you're my only hope.

"bx8klb","climate","scientific","I need solid, peer-reviewed evidence for climate change!","My stepfather believes that climate change is a hoax run by the government to get control and money from the carbon tax. Fake news and all that jazz. I'm sick of it.  I need some solid, peer reviewed evidence and articles proving that climate change is real and that we are causing it through emissions so that I can smack him with some hard scientific facts. He asked for proof on my side. I've tried to explain carbon emissions and the warming of the earth but he says it could just be a coincidence. What can I show him to solidly prove climate change is caused by humans? Preferably non-government articles since he believes that the government is the bad man.
