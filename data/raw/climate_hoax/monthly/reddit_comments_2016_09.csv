I can't access #2 but it states that global warming is a hoax but without being able to see specifics I can't refute them but try Skeptical Science http://www.skepticalscience.com/

""In a presentation at the 2012 EIKE Climate Conference in Germany, Professor Friedrich-Karl Ewert, a retired geologist and data expert from the University of Paderborn""
The webpage this is from could be made in an afternoon, the link to the conference mentions Steve Goddard who is a nutter. Friedrich-Karl Ewert, is not a climate scientist, his findings are not recognized by climate experts, data is fine tuned and all the records are public. There is no conspiracy here.

4 like the others is from a right wing outlet. There is no climate scientist involved, no peer reviewed papers, reference to a 10 year period which is insignificant to science. 
Here is 4.6 billion years of CO2 history presented to the National Academies of Science. Now which one is lying??

""NAS member Richard Alley presents on 4.6 Billion Years of Earth’s Climate History: The Role of CO2, during the Symposium—Earths, Moons, Mars & Stars at the National Academy of Sciences 152nd Annual Meeting.""

You cannot debunk deniers are their minds are made up. There is now ""The science of why people don't believe science"". The human mind did not develop quickly enough emotionally and cognitively to be able to understand climate science. Libertarians who don't believe that governments should be involved in people's lives will never accept climate science to be true, and this happens in their subconscious mind. 

""The Science of Why We Don't Believe in Science"" Based on Dan Kahan's studies at Yale

Humans are just too busy to learn about climate science, don't want to hear about it, It's God's work, they just can't understand it, change is scary, they are invested in fossil fuel profits, or are libertarians etc. There are a lot of reasons that people want those bogus articles to be true and the flawed subconscious human mind with it's cognitive dissonance is always happy to let people believe what they want to. 

Facts do not change deniers minds but good luck!!

"d7rkku6","t3_53b5x6","53b5x6","climate","scientific","There is only on accepted version of science the world over. The laws of physics and gravity are the same in every country and the scientific conclusions regarding climate change are accepted all over the world by 97% of working climate scientists.

There is not one academy of science in the world that doesn't support that climate change is a fact. A denier can't find one anywhere in the world.

There is no group or coalition of scientists that have a unified hypothesis to disprove climate change. If there was clear evidence that climate change was not a fact there would be a large group of people all making the same claim backed by accepted science.

The three most prominent scientific publications in North America are Science, Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science. When you compare their peer-reviewed science articles to the verbal diarrhea in the four links you posted it's clear how many intellectually less fortunate and gullible people that there are that suck up that nonsense.","2016-09-18 08:33:32","4","extinction6","1747756661.71123","climate hoax","manual"

Attack the denial itself, unless his PhD is in climate science what does he bring to the party ? Bertrand Russell's defintion of skeptic (i.e if you're not an expert, go with the consensus) is my goto for people who are not climate scientists and I see no point engaging them in debate, argue with an idiot and you'll be beaten every time.

Unicorn scenario and you 'change their mind' what do you expect from that  ?  Change of political disposition and emisisons mitigation or the same prodigious emissions and political outlook they're likely engaged in already?","2016-09-18 23:59:12","2","Capn_Underpants","1747756661.719081","climate hoax","manual"

Recognize that such denial is tightly correlated with particular political views and deeply held assumptions, to the point that the denial has become a ""tribal marker"" -- an item of faith reflecting allegiance to a particular political/social group. If you MUST deal with him on these matters, I suggest you identify his tribe (probably right-wing and/or evangelical) and try to find a sympathetic way to deal with the personal and social subjects represented there, instead of beating your head against the wall of climate myths.
