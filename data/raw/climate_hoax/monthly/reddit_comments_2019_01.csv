"ef31n3k","t3_akad36","akad36","climatechange","action-oriented","You probably can't convince someone who makes arguments similar to your dad. I just wrote a comment going over some of the evidence for anthropogenic warming, here it is:

The models are doing well despite what anyone says: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/climate-model-projections-compared-to-observations/ And if the models were substantially different from observations in a way that was unexpected then there would need to be a rethinking of what we know about forcings. But whether humans are having an influence or not is beyond question at this point. The temperature rise we have experienced is probably higher than anything experienced in the holocene. [Here is a graph](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png) of temperatures from the last 12,000 years at a 20 year resolution. That graph is from [this paper by Marcott](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~mli/Economics%207004/Marcott_Global%20Temperature%20Reconstructed.pdf). Also note how the modern instrument records is a huge unnatural looking spike. If there were a huge spike like that anywhere in the proxy records we would be able to see it.

The first prediction of a large temperature rise due to carbon emissions was made in 1896 by [Svante Arrhenius](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_3.php), his rough calculation was high but it was very good considering the small amount of information he had. He correctly calculated the right order of magnitude of the change. And now we have instrumental observations that show temperatures have risen at a pace that still has no known precedence [ [In the past century alone, the temperature has climbed 0.7 degrees Celsius, roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page3.php) ] rise to a point that has not been seen in *at least* [2000 years](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott_PAGES2k.png). Could the early scientists have gotten lucky with their prediction? That they could predict a huge unprecedented temperature rise that has no known precedent of happening in many thousands of years and then for it to happen directly after making the prediction. You at least have to admit that the sharp temperature spike looks a lot like [this graph](https://climate.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/24_co2-graph-021116-768px.jpg).  

But you know it's not just the basic physics and the observation of correlation that is convincing, but most people don't seem to understand that there are physical fingerprints in the atmosphere that show us what is causing the warming. For instance did you know that while the troposphere is warming the stratosphere is actually cooling? This happens as a transient effect when a large amount of greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere this blocks infrared radiation from reaching into the stratosphere, and so it cools. This effect has been observed and any other known source of temperature change would not have this result. If the Sun were the cause then all layers of the atmosphere would warm. If you want to dig deeper: [[1]](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/10/1305332110) [[2]](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1256/qj.02.186)

And it's not just that the stratosphere is cooling but also the diurnal temperature range (daily macimum and minimum temperature difference) is decreasing and the tropopause height is increasing. These observable effects are what go into fingerprint attribution studies. They can not be explained without a large greenhouse gas effect. Looking at these effects is just one method of attribution as well, there are many papers using different methods that come to a similar conclusion that humans are the cause. [This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change#/media/File:Attribution_of_global_warming.jpg) was developed from an IPCC report that weighed all the different studies.

Therefore, climate denial is also like a religion to them - something based on faith because, obviously, it isn't based on facts. Since they don't believe in science, you can't use science to prove climate change exists. Nothing will convince them that science is real except their own negative experiences with climate change. Even then, they may attribute those events to some sort of naturally occurring cycle. I saw someone's post after the massive fire wiped out the town of Paradise, California where he/she referred to the fire as natural ""vegetation renewal"". My suggestion is to not get caught up in your dad's climate denial minutia and simply treat the situation as if he were a member of a religion whose beliefs you don't share.

All the information he has on climate change should come from climate scientists, but it’s actually coming from climate deniers, who are generally not climate scientists. What’s the point? This is like reading critiques and reviews to see if a movie is good. Maybe the critiques are biased, or maybe they don’t resonate with the material. No matter what it is, it would be best for you to decide for yourself than to have others decide for you. 

The best way to find the truth is to genuinely argue from both side. Become aware of the pitfalls and strengths of each side of an argument. The more educated you are, the more likely your chance to find the truth.

My advice, tell your dad you believe in the science of climate change but you want to understand why he doesn’t. Ask your dad if he is willing to do research on both sides of the debate. You do the same. I guarantee you will both learn something new.

You might not be able to convince him but at the very least you will have done something genuine and sincere with your dad. It isn’t ideal, but it’s something good.
