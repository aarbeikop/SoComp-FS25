"9sj6fn","environment","emotional","Please help in my fight regards climate change?","Hi Redditors, I'll make this quick and easy.
I live in Mackay Queensland Australia.
One of the largest coal export facilities in the Southern Hemisphere.

I'm trying to get people here to really look at the recent IPCC report.

I get very bad results...'it's just a hoax'... 'Al Gore was wrong'... 'fucking greenies just want to kill off coal'...'sea levels aren't rising'...'bullshit this has all happened before'...

Denial on a scale that is very hard to combat.
So much money is being made that nobody wants to stop.
Some of my mates are literally driving the machines on the coalface...and I'm literally asking them to quit work.

They keep asking show me PROOF...

What do I want from you?
Please give me ten high credential articles from believable and verifiable sources?
Something I can show that will make people pause and go 'wait... I didn't know this..?'

That is all I'm asking for...10 rock solid undeniable articles that I can fight back with.
I'm here people, in the centre of what is declared by IPCC as having to end totally...
Yet last year was the best coal export year ever produced by Australia... this year looks like being more. 
The government here is granting mining approvals and exploratory licences like their life depends on it...

If IPCC was right this year? Then our future is at stake and I need all the help I can get.

Thank you in advance to those who respond.","2018-10-30 00:56:58","12","8","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/9sj6fn/please_help_in_my_fight_regards_climate_change/","True","Djanga51","1747765753.391839","climate hoax","manual"
"9p92gn","collapse","skeptical","Is there a list for who's responsible for global warming?","You know? The CEO's of polluters or influential people/news guys who claim climate change is a hoax. 

I feel like that list will be very handy.","2018-10-18 13:04:10","3","15","0.59","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9p92gn/is_there_a_list_for_whos_responsible_for_global/","True","Aveline_is_cool","1747765923.911448","climate hoax","manual"
