"7yjpck","climate","scientific","Help appreciated","Would appreciate help on this one. My father has recently come into friendship with some climate change skeptics who are regailing him with stories of climate change being a hoax. Notably this video recently seems to have had quite an impact on him. Would appreciate any sources anyone has off the top of their head debunking this.  (Before anyone lmgtfy I did Google this already and there was an overwhelming amount of ""information"". It was very hard to sort through the noise to find signal.)
