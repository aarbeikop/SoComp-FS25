"duhabqe","t3_7yjpck","7yjpck","climate","scientific","The 38 scientific papers that skeptics/deniers like to quote, because they seem to contradict anthropogenic global warming, have been analyzed in detail by an international panel of climate scientists, and every single one has been found to have a major flaw: ranging from  cherry picking data; to assuming the ability to fit a carefully selected  subset of the data to a periodic function, means everything is periodic; to assuming the sun and moon didn't affect things in one time period, but did affect things in a different period; to just plain calculating their statistics incorrectly:

[R. E. Benestad, D. Nuccitelli, S. Lewandowsky, K. Hayhoe, H. O. Hygen. Rob van Dorland, J. Cook, “Learning from mistakes in climate research,” Theoretical and Applied Climatology, 126(3–4), 699–703 (2016).](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5)

There is a nice summary of each paper's major flaw in Table S3 of the review's [supplemental material.](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00704-015-1597-5/MediaObjects/704_2015_1597_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)

So far as the different arguments climate change deniers make, the 42 common ones have been throughly analyzed, and their false premises and faulty reasoning exposed in detail by Cook et. al.

Again, there is a nice table summarizing the logic errors in each argument in the [supplemental material.](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/13/2/024018/media/ERL_aaa49f_Table_S2_Analysis_of_42_Contrarian_Claims.pdf)

This may be more detailed than you need, but it is good, sound science.","2018-02-19 06:14:27","3","ECatPlay","1747762489.1843781","climate hoax","manual"

""I’m climate change denier Tony Heller. You might know me better by my pen name, “Steven Goddard,” or Twitter handle, @SteveSGoddard. This is my story.

First, you should know that I’m pretty much a nobody in the climate debate. I’m laughed at by all climatologists. I’m not even taken seriously by true climate skeptics. I don’t have a degree in climatology. I haven’t written a single academic paper about climate change and I don’t have a job related to climatology or the weather. What I do have is a blog and a Twitter account. And as it turns out, that’s pretty much all you need to be a somebody in the climate debate.""
""Like a shit stain, my blog is ugly, embarrassing and, as much as you hate to, it’s something you have to deal with.""

He is one of the worst writers I have ever run across. Heller can foam at the mouth all he wants but his opinions mean squat to science unless he can get his ideas to pass the testing and standards of the scientific method, which he admits above that he has never done.

Also
There is no unified hypothesis stating why climate change is not happening. CO2 traps IR in the atmosphere and this process is based on the laws of physics.

There is not one academy of science anywhere in the world that does not agree with the 97% consensus. Ask your father to find one. It's a ridiculous conspiracy theory to contend that all of the world's climate scientists from many countries somehow contacted each other and that they all agreed to lie about climate change? 

Climate change is being taught in high schools now.

Every country in the world has signed on to the Paris Climate Accord except the US.

There is the world conference of mayors that are teaming together to fight climate change. 

Some of the world's largest and most well known companies have joined the RE100 initiative to work toward using 100% renewable energy and a few companies like Google have already achieved the goal. http://re100.org/

Others that are working to fight climate change include; The US Military, Bill Gates, Sir Richard Branson, Elon Musk, Steven Hawkins, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku etc.

...............................

A lot of fossil fuel funding has gone toward misleading people about the science so profits can keep flowing. Many climate change deniers are linked financially to these organizations.

2014 Hans Jenny Memorial Lecture: Chris Mooney, ""The Science of Why We Don't Believe in Science""

Start at 7:00 if you watch this. It explains why facts don't persuade climate change deniers and how the process of denial takes place in the subconscious. If your father won't change his mind this will help you understand why. One researcher suggested that humans did not have enough time to evolve quickly enough emotionally and cognitively from the hunter gatherer days to be able to process modern science. Don't be surprised if your dad doesn't want to disagree with his ""tribe"".  

Please ask for any more information that you need as there is a lot available. ECatPlay's response was great and I just threw out some other ideas.
