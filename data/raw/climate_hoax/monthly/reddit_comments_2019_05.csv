You. And I. Understand the difference bt scientific findings, journals , etc. 

My point is that ideologues on both sides, see a bit of lazy journalism like this that has multiple references to “science”, and assume that the opinions on the science *and* the policy are scientific.","2019-05-01 02:38:22","1","jefemundo","1747768571.019673","climate hoax","manual"

>The current CO2 ppm are at around 400. Below 250, plants start to suffer significantly. CO2 is crucial to life.

So what? Plants (and people) suffer due to [heat stress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018328654), as well. Any potential gains from CO2 fertilisation are neutralised by higher temperatures in [rice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5690611/), the world's most important grain.

>400 million years ago, CO2 ppm were over 6000. Back then, the Earth was full of life already.

So what? Humans - and all other life on Earth at the present time - didn't exist 400 million years ago.

>It is hard to find good data on CO2 volatility in ppm, but it appears to fluctuate over time a fair amount.

Are you suggesting that the release of \~500,000,000,000 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere since 1900 ***isn't*** the cause of increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere?

>Water vapor is more impactful as a greenhouse gas than CO2. And most people would prefer the stable temperatures of a sea climate (much water vapor) to inland desert climate (little water vapor). The desert climate simply fluctuates too much for people. So it seems that CO2 also has this stabilizing effect.

*Citation needed*.

>Ice ages are manifested when the sun is relatively inactive. When the sun gets more active, the Earth, as well as other planets in vicinity, heat up. This component has a lot more impact than on the temperature than any greenhouse gas. Which is kind of obvious actually, since virtually all warmth on the surface of Earth comes from the sun.

*Citation needed.* When did the sun become ""more active?"". It's been [relatively stable since at least 1750](https://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Educational/2/3/1).","2019-05-16 15:06:56","2","TheMercian","1747768640.728426","climate hoax","manual"

Crop issues around the world have everything to do with terrible planting conditions and flooding. Magically, of course, plants planted in areas not being shredded by climate change are just fine. Kind of interesting, isn’t it? In a Grand Solar Minimum, one would expect *all* plants to see a drop in photosynthetic activity, not just grain crops.
