"akad36","climatechange","action-oriented","My father is a stubborn denier. What *undisputable* proof is there to support man-made climate change?","I've usually just let it go just to not stir up drama, but he's spending time in alt-right bubbles and has become more and more adamant about how climate change is a hoax, and how this and that random professor featured on the website he frequents says it's a hoax cooked up by evil globalists so it must be true.

I've tried telling him about the rise in global temperature the last century (and he says ""random professor #14 has evidence to the contrary""), about how how parts of greenland are now getting uncovered and the arctic circle shrinking (""temperature just goes in cycles naturally, the arctic circle is bigger than ever says random professor #11, NASA satellites are contolled by the globalists, carbon dioxide is required for life, Sweden was tropic back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Much warmer than now! Sea levels are dropping, not rising"").

He is great at shooting down just about every piece of evidence if there's only the slightest angle of attack available, and even if all the things I know about climate change is stuff every kid knows, it's just about making me doubt it myself. 

So, I need to know, is there any evidence for climate change that cannot be refuted. Hard evidence that comes from multiple, undisputably neutral sources? Or how do you convince someone who can just say ""that data is manufactured by the globalists"" to everything?","2019-01-27 08:31:30","30","60","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/akad36/my_father_is_a_stubborn_denier_what_undisputable/","True","SavantButDeadly","1747766860.4372501","climate hoax","manual"

There's nothing I can do about it. I'm in the US, and even the president claims it's a hoax.. I feel like no one will do anything until it's too late. How good are the chances that the world I live in might actually be okay by the end of my life? Or is it more likely I'll be living in a hell?","2019-01-31 15:37:31","7","14","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/alqneo/im_worried_about_my_own_future_and_feel_like_my/","True","asrthw","1747766940.674796","climate hoax","manual"
