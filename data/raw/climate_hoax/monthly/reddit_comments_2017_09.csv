It doesn't really matter if it is the climate change or something else, but it cannot go on like this forever. Greed, consumerism, competitiveness and so many other disgusting human features have become accepted virtues that most people are striving for. Everyone is just running constantly trying to grab as much as possible for themselves. And I do it myself. I spend most of the hours I'm awake working and stressing over things that are just ridiculous and I hate it.

I was born in the 70s, I live in northern Europe, and I don't have any children, so it is easy for me. I know that I'm safe from climate change and I know it will be the poor people far away from here that will take the first hit. And they are already getting hit. There is even a part of me that hopes that the climate change would happen sooner than later so that I would be here to see it happen.

It really is a sad situation but I'm afraid stopping climate change will just postpone the inevitable. I hate sounding like a doomsday collapse guy, but the numbers just don't add up. Something has got to give. ","2017-09-01 19:57:04","1","PolymorphicType","1747760776.8211951","climate hoax","manual"
