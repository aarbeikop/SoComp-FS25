"d1sxziu","t3_4djjhs","4djjhs","climate","scientific","Even if, and it's a big IF, some of the predictions of man-made global warming were a 'conspiracy' like you seem to believe, if the end result of our eco-friendly actions ends up being good in general for humanity, the environment, and the planet, then wouldn't it be better to follow politically towards a more environment-friendly society? Now, in reality, there's no conspiracy : there's only the big question of how long we have before this planet becomes unhabitable, and people have ideas, and speak about it, but noone can really answer exactly because spoiler : noone has a time machine to go in the future and be sure 100%. However, given the scale of the risk (end of humanity), wouldn't it be better to assume it's going to happen sooner, let's say before 2500, and take all the necessary precautions right now so that it doesn't happen, at all? it's cool that you're skeptic about stuff in general. But if you would look at it without the 'conspiracy theory' glasses, look at the big picture, the probabilities that it's 'all a big conspiracy', are zero. And even if, the conspiracy would benefit humanity as a whole, so yeah. So I don't get why fight for denouncing this so called 'conspiracy' and not others that might happen in the world right now?","2016-04-07 01:07:08","1","dark-bats","1747754681.2427762","climate hoax","manual"

 Lay people, when confronted by complex problems, will often take a shortcut to an answer, by relying on the opinions of those they trust [Daniel Kahneman], and likely aligning with the stance of their political party. Without questioning what they hear, the incorrect information becomes firmly established.  
And it's unlikely that any new contradicting information would dislodge their beliefs, especially since it would mean going against the beliefs to which their political party subscribes","2016-04-11 12:58:53","3","fungussa","1747754727.543723","climate hoax","manual"

"d1yk1ke","t3_4e9p6f","4e9p6f","climate","scientific","The implications of climate change are staggering.  Any person that has thought about the realities of the situation would understand that everything that drives our economy both figuratively (growth) and literally (fossil fuels) adds to the climate change problem.  Every action on an individual and corporate level must be completely changed to accommodate climate realities.  When you think about the unimaginably massive effort and trust required to make a considerable change, it seems out of the realm of human capabilities to deal with.  Climate change seems to simply be the result of human civilization.  So whether someone actively denies it or not, the true issue is that it goes against everything that we believe in.","2016-04-11 15:52:17","1","wostestwillis","1747754727.547942","climate hoax","manual"
