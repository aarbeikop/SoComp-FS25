How can one try and find peace with what we are facing regarding the perils of climate change? I had to put my phone down today after reading about the family of 6 who drowned in their van trying to escape the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, and of the toddler who clung to her mother’s dead body, awaiting rescue. And of the images of Houston and the surrounding areas looking like something from the movie Waterworld. I think: this is climate change being experienced in fits and starts. Cities slowly become uninhabitable. They may rebuild, but the waters will return.

I just put my phone down and cried.

As someone who has always been in agreement with human-caused climate change, who hand-wrote an essay about global warming in 1989, who went on to study environmental geography, who cycles to work, eats a mostly local, vegetarian diet (tries to), avoids single use plastic, attends protests, donates money to organizations fighting pipeline expansions, educates herself on the science, politics, and economics of climate related issues … 

All I feel is despair. Total, abject despair. 

We have a toddler. I love her so much. I worry about her future. Every day.

I think about the politicians and “scientists” who are bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry, who – through junk science - have been convinced that climate change is a hoax. And then they spread this toxic message. The inaction resulting from this muddying of the waters is putting all of humanity at risk. I think about the Koch brothers and then about the family in Houston that drowned and I want to blame the Koch brothers. I think: **They have blood on their hands!!!** But then I just feel low, bitter, and hostile. 

I am sensitive that people suffering from Harvey want to focus on their immediate future and safety. And maybe they don’t want to think about climate change because it’s simply too painful. Too painful to think that this is going to be the new normal. That they may rebuild their homes, but that the waters will return. That they may be a climate refugee. And what’s worse: that the severity of Harvey could have been prevented. *That this was preventable.* That is so anguishing.

I guess my question to r/climate is …. How do you cope? Even if you are doing things within your control and influence, how do you live day-to-day with the fear that the future is going to be grim ... and possibly beyond what we can comprehend? 

How do you find peace?
