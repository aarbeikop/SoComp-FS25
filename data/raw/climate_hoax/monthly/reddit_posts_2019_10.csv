——

I recently encountered a climate change denier in the wild and thought, “You know what, there are plenty of reputable sources out there that agree that climate change is real and being caused by humans. I’m going to collect a list of those sources and show them to this person.”

So I did, and I wanted to share this mega list with you, to better arm you to help people accept what is happening to our planet. So here goes:

EDIT: a lot of these sources also talk about the causes of climate change, and the fact that climate change is being primarily caused by human CO2 emissions. Many also cover additional evidence of human caused climate change.","2019-10-27 22:59:04","164","134","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/do0jlg/heres_a_megalist_of_reputable_sources_proving/","True","TheJoshWatson","1747770672.726708","climate hoax","manual"
"dez09a","climatechange","action-oriented","The ol' racist uncle","So like many people I have an uncle who, while I love him very much, is swayed rather heavily by fake news and is firmly of the opinion that this climate change thing is just a hoax and people will grow out of it - I'm rather less sure, and I'm convinced that anthropogenic climate change is absolutely a thing.

However, today he's posted something on Facebook, with a comment to the effect of ""it's all so logical and makes sense"", which I'm not entirely prepared to take on; to this end, have people encountered this before, and what did they think? The science from the IPCC is clear, but to specifically battle this, what's what?

"dbzuf9","climate","scientific","Natural Climate Change?","Hello all, I am honestly curious as to what many of you think about the concept of natural climate change rather than man made. So evidence proves that the climate of Earth has drastically changed numerous times throughout recorded history. Some examples of this are the Roman warm period, the medieval warm period, and the little ice age. Evidence shows the climate of Europe was warm enough 2000 years ago to grow grapes in England year round. The earth cooled and roughly 1000 years later warmed again. From the 1500-1800’s, the earth cooled enough to produce snow and frost in the summer months in many countries in the northern hemisphere, even prior to the 1815 eruption of Mt. Tambora. Many people suggest the earth is only warming due to us recently coming out of a “mini ice age”. Some will even say global warming is a full blown hoax due to most of the scientific community predicting in the 1970’s that we were on the verge of another impending ice age or global cooling event. Just looking for some educated feedback on this matter.

Please help me you guys. I need an insightful article or journal that indicates the full extent of what's going on that any idiot can understand.
