1) there is good science and bad science. Good science gives us more power and control. Bad science takes away power and control. 

2) GW (as a concept) threatens the income of powerful people and companies. These interests benefit from delaying any changes that might reduce their income. 

3) group 2 applies technique 1 to stoke FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) in a wide enough audience that GW becomes a question, sufficiently uncertain that nothing need be done about it. ","2018-09-05 06:17:55","3","ElectronGuru","1747765265.001363","climate hoax","manual"
"e5f6h3l","t3_9d3mvn","9d3mvn","climate","scientific","You could also try /climatechange (you'll get conversations about earth system sensitivity and definitions of lukewarmers) or /energy. Really, you should ask why people don't believe in *anthropogenic* climate change. The denial train has moved away from ""there is no climate change"" to ""climate change has always happened & humans don't have a significant impact"".

Maybe if you try in askreddit (wide exposure) or some of the Donald Trump subs you'll get ""Chinese hoax"" stuff? ","2018-09-05 06:16:29","2","InvisibleRegrets","1747765265.006731","climate hoax","manual"
"e5jlrzs","t3_9d3mvn","9d3mvn","climate","scientific","Look up Dan Kahan and either read his blog or watch some of his many lectures on Youtube. His research is on barriers to effective science communication and politically motivated reasoning. His theories extend beyond just climate change, but do a pretty good job explaining the phenomenon. Briefly, Hierarchical Individualists generally outsize the risks of government regulations and therefore have a cognitive bias to believing that the risk is small or nonexistent. Counterintuitively, science comprehension deepens this belief (smarter people in this group are more sure it's not happening). It's really all fascinating and nearly all his published work is open and accessible.","2018-09-07 07:24:09","2","nwagers","1747765265.0119019","climate hoax","manual"
"e5fbchd","t3_9d3mvn","9d3mvn","climate","scientific","An excerpt from Bruce Cannon Gibney's 2015 book, *A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America:*

&#x200B;

>Humans do affect climate, with consequences including warming, famine, flooding, rising and acidifying oceans, and so on. In essence, the consequences are serious, and we will shortly approach the point of no return if real efforts aren’t made. Unfortunately, the point of no return is toward the end of Boomer lifetimes and the consequences will start arriving – you can already guess the dates – between the 2030s and the 2050s. Millennials will not be eager to retire to Florida.  
>  
>Of the many impediments to climate reform in the United States, two stand out. First, many Boomers do not believe that global warming exists or, even if it does, that it poses a real problem, another example of the generation’s anti-empirical bias. In 2014–2015, less than half of Boomers believed that humans were causing the planet to warm – 48 percent among younger Boomers, 31 percent among older Boomers and the shrinking set of their elders. By contrast, 60 percent of those eighteen to twenty-nine believed in anthropogenic climate change, a major difference, though still depressingly short of the 82–97+ percent of scientists who hold that view.   
>  
>Consistent with their (self-serving) climate beliefs, Boomers and their elders have more favorable views about fossil fuels than younger Americans. The influence of the Boomer+ cohort means that overall, the United States is roughly split on climate change, and given the bias toward the status quo, little action can be expected in the near term.  
>  
>This leads to the second problem: To avoid problems in the future, expenses will have to be borne *today*. Only 21 percent of people over fifty (largely Boomers) are “very concerned” that climate change will affect them, and in this, they are largely correct. By contrast, *there is a 100 percent chance that reforms today will have costs that affect Boomers.* For sociopaths, the timing mismatch makes climate reform a nonstarter. Boomer views about the science of climate change may be divorced from reality, but their other views are narrowly rational and consistent. They are just not empathetic or forward thinking.
