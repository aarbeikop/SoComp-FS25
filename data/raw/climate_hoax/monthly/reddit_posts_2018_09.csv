"9d3mvn","climate","scientific","Why do you not believe in global warming? / Is global warming a hoax?","I firmly believe in climate change and global warming, but I always wanted to understand why do people do not believe in global warming? 

I want to learn about your views and the reason behind your beliefs on thinking global warming to be a conspiracy / hoax / lie, and what would be required for you to change that belief?  


The more information you give me the better.
