For what is worth, my experience with Cc deniers is that you will get nowhere by simply providing evidence. For them, and especially in your community, accepting evidence of climate change means changing The way the live and work. It is much more then an intellectual argument: it is an emotional one. So from one side you have to provide solid arguments,  from the other you have to understand which emotions or values come into play when speaking of climate change preventing a change of view. 
On the first part I suggest asking them what proof they would require, and then bringing the evidence. If you are able to demonstrate that climate change is real using their selected indicators, that might cause a dent in their belief system . I would rely on the IPCC reports as sources. You do not get more solid then that.
On the emotional level you have to avoid at all costs to make them feel miserable, on the wrong side or ignorant. Instead show how they could make a difference, how meaningful it would be, how many ways there are to go green, how this could improve their lives beyond climate change. Remember that if cc affects us all, we are asking this people the most effort.

 While speaking of convincing farmers to go more sustainable an old professor of mine told me something I will never forget: "" farmers don't have ears, but they have eyes!"". If you can, turn your house and life in a living low carbon lab: install solar panels on the roof and brag about how small is your electric bill.  Plant trees in the garden and make your friends feel how cooler it is in summer, get a hybrid car and show them how cool it is to not have exhaustion gas near your kids....

God speed my friend, we all need it.","2018-10-30 09:17:00","4","ciskoh3","1747765753.763432","climate hoax","manual"

If we aren’t healthy we can’t keep up the fight to change others’ minds. I’d urge you to create a clear plan to move to a less hostile area. I’ve heard Melbourne is very nice, I don’t know. 

[Here’s one article.](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Johnson%20%20Levin%202009%20The%20Tragedy%20of%20Cognition.pdf) It’s more for you than to convince anyone else though. It’s about the psychology of climate change denial. Cheers.

The oil and gas industry has been lobbying hard to prevent action on climate change for years but they aren't the only ones. Banks and automotive corporations are also involved because they benefit from the fossil fuel industry. And then there are other major players in the finance industry who make their money off of the status quo.

Here's a rundown of emissions by sector, country etc. As you can see rich western countries and China have been emitting the most. Europe seems to have curbed emissions somewhat.

* Every politician who took bribes to vote for legislation against the common good.

* Every lobbyist who paid those bribes.

* Every industrialist who weighed capitalism over sustainability.

* Every newscaster, television presenter, marketing manager, salesperson, and the agencies they worked for who deliberately lied and influenced the public into more and more consumerism every day.

* And ultimately every single person who ever weighed money and profit over the lives and future and welfare of others.
