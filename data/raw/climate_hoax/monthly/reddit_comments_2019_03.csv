"eimckm0","t3_b1kkoj","b1kkoj","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm sure there are many reasons!

Ones I've encountered include :

Fear. Fear that *if* anthropogenic climate change is real, it means unprecedented change /lost quality of life /lost dreams/worse future for their children or themselves. Once one accepts climate change as real, happening, and severe, it means that one has to look for solutions - a long, arduos, emotionally draining process for many people. It means that dreams for a better future, the house with a white picket fence, 2.5 children, and a utopic future will never happen. Food and water scarcity are scary. Social instability and geopolitical strife are also scary. 

Paranoia: the belief that because governments lie, cheat, and steal, they *always* lie, cheat, and steal. Especially when large international organizations are involved (IPCC etc).

Self - entitlement : if climate change is real, people will need to give up what they feel they are entitled to - an easy retirement, economic growth, a better future for them and theirs, and the amazing future that we have been promised for decades.

Also, some weird double-standard in human ability where they don't think humans could have a large enough impact on an earth system such as the climate, while also believing that humans could easily deal with any change *if it was happening*.

I'm sure there are many more, but these are the general ones I've come up against. ","2019-03-15 21:50:44","3","InvisibleRegrets","1747767657.8744268","climate hoax","manual"

"ein2feq","t3_b1kkoj","b1kkoj","climatechange","action-oriented","Two reasons:

1. They've lived long enough to see several proclamations of doom fail to materialize, have seen actual cons based on supposedly good science, and/or have seen things with a supposed scientific consensus turn out to be wrong. Examples:
    - Acid rain scare.
    - The Theranos debacle. 
    - Dietary fat causing heart disease.

2. The people promoting the message are repellent and/or not seen as credible. Examples:
    - Anti-natalists. (They deny global trends in fertility.)
    - Some vegans. (They overstate the contribution of agriculture to GHG emissions.) 
    - People claiming that climate change is a real problem also strongly opposing nuclear power. (They are scientifically illiterate and/or innumerate.)
    - Political activists, especially socialists/communists. (They want to use global climate policy to push anti-capitalist measures.)

If you genuinely wish to understand why people are skeptical about climate change, you have to be prepared to listen. You could look at the climateskeptics subreddit.  And don't take any notice of the idiots who say they are paid by the oil companies. Are your parents paid by the oil companies?

People tend to get wiser and more skeptical as they get older, partly due to having seen other alarmist scares come and go. ","2019-03-15 23:27:25","0","etzpcm","1747767657.8901079","climate hoax","manual"
"einb6em","t3_b1kkoj","b1kkoj","climatechange","action-oriented","Well, ""climate change"" is kind of a nonsensical way to grasp the various environmental effects that are included under that term. 

""Global climate change"" is typically measured by variability in the global mean surface temperature. But nobody bases important decisions on the global mean surface temp. 

Instead people experience climate regionally, and primarily through weather — which is already pretty variable. That's where the meaningful predictions will be made. But currently our models for predicting regional weather in the medium-to-long terms are pretty unreliable.

So anyone who thinks ""climate change"" is stupid as a discourse will get a sympathetic hearing from me. It *is* stupid. Its use is mostly as a political slogan, not as a scientific topic.

The scientific topics that make up climate change are mostly:

* Sea-level rise

* Ocean acidification

* Ecosystem collapse

* Higher-energy troposphere (basically, higher storm intensity)

It's a lot more productive to discuss these effects. Sea-level rise, for instance, has been going on for quite a while — yet people have managed to adapt to it, even with pretty primitive technology sometimes. So anyone who thinks future sea-level rises require urgent action now has a high bar of proof to clear. Probably no one has yet cleared it, but maybe someday they will.

Also people are just naturally skeptical of long-range model predictions about complex systems. If I told you I had a model which predicts the level of the S&P 500 Index to within 1% on January 1, 2030 — you probably wouldn't wager a single dollar on my being right. You'd be skeptical, and your skepticism would be well-founded. 

So you can't be surprised when people's natural skepticism extends to climate models which cover *several* decades (and which only estimate mean temps on a global scale). It's rational to be skeptical of such models, until they produce some regional, short-term predictions which can be meaningfully tested. That's how people usually build up trust in a modeling process, and I think it will happen with climate models. But we're just not there yet, and anyone who expresses principled skepticism about current models is hard to counter effectively. In twenty years the track record of predictive models might be a lot better. ","2019-03-16 06:43:38","-1","DocHarford","1747767657.894301","climate hoax","manual"
"eimi3fs","t3_akad36","akad36","climatechange","action-oriented","There is undistputable proof for anthropogenic rise in CO2 levels due to carbon isotope C14 being radioactive, having a half-life of some 50,000 years and thus not being present anymore in fossil fuels, meaning that it's lacking in CO2 emanating from man-made sources. CO2 with absent C14 has been measured in concentrations way higher than expected. You can hit your dad with that, it's the most devastating argument that is undisputable in every way.

Everything else is disputable, unfortunately. There is plenty of hard evidence, but undisputable is a bold claim to make.","2019-03-15 23:01:12","1","FrankdeBoer","1747767705.0633442","climate hoax","manual"
