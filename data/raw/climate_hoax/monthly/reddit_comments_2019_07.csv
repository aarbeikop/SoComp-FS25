&#x200B;

If the goal is to change minds, keep it soft and let the logic to sink in. If the logic works, you do not have to use adjectives like ""important"" .. they will know. If the logic does not work, it does not matter.

You may also want to add that the creation of new jobs because one typical counter is economics. Add something like ""Moving towards renewable will also create new economics activities and opportunities for growth"".","2019-07-25 13:29:25","4","[deleted]","1747769447.008482","climate hoax","manual"

If climate alarmists win, the economy becomes more ""socialist"" in denialist's minds : more state intervention, less liberties.

Get a discovery process started in the ICC, make them live the remainder of their lives as hunted fugitives, eventually invade whatever private island they're on, arrest the bastards, give em a nice fair show trial and then execute them on TV like the Ceaucescus.

Then beam the footage into outer space for as long as possible as a grim warning of what happens to people like that. ""Sic semper tyrranis"", and liars and genocidal gangsters as well.","2019-07-15 10:53:11","16","[deleted]","1747769713.033037","climate hoax","manual"
"ettx1t7","t3_cdfdv6","cdfdv6","collapse","skeptical","I appreciate the spirit of this, but the thing about leaving messages for the future is that it really matters what future you're expecting.

If you expect largely unbroken continuity of language and culture, then yeah, go ahead and write the names down.

But what if this monument survives to a time where language has changed quite a bit -- not entirely, but enough that it would be like translating Aramaic or another language that largely fell out of use?

I'm picturing a future society that finds this monument, and it becomes a place of worship to the names of the powerful humans of the past. Let's say they even understand the basic meaning ""these people were powerful, and their actions destroyed the world"" but the language differences fail to convey ""and we wrote their names here because they are bad"" 

-- those sound like Gods or Demigods.

Another, broader point -- Think about the history of monuments human civilization. Don't you think it matters that 99.9% of monuments commemorate great people, or memorialize victims? What could possibly signal, in a manner that transcends language and time, the counter intuitive idea that this is a monument to evil people, that the names on it aren't commemorated but to be cursed?

If language breaks, these monuments become useless, or even counterproductive if people worship ""the old Gods, Beyzos and Musk, whose power melted our ice, and who if we please them through sacrifice, may use their great and divine power to save us"".

Consider that the names of those responsible have very little importance or use to anyone more than 2-3 generations from today, unless your aim is to seed a post-apocalyptic cult whose sole purpose is hunting the descendants of the billionaires.","2019-07-15 13:48:46","9","EVJoe","1747769713.03793","climate hoax","manual"
