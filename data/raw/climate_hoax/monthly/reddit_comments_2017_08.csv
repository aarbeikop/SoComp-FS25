I see myself through the lens of the broad sweep of time and space. We are likely entering the narrowing throat of The Great Filter. Our position in human history is unique as we hurtle toward self-immolation. Overwhelming tragedy and even the potential for collective insanity as the public finally grasps how we've failed ourselves is balanced, for me, by the small potential to reinvent ourselves as Planetary Managers - a society united and cooperative enough to transform our selves and our economy for sustainability. At the boundary between chaos and order, information takes precedence over matter and energy. Each of us has more power to change the world during this narrow window than anyone has ever had before. Even small changes can have nonlinear exponential positive impacts. Everything you do, especially integrating your emotions and intellectual grasp of what's happening - especially sharing that - matters. Even if we all ultimately fail, as so many civilizations must have on other planets, your actions will make a difference in how long humanity survives and whether your daughter will have a better chance of building on your legacy.","2017-08-31 14:05:00","2","HumanistRuth","1747760426.369396","climate hoax","manual"

It's a bit like death where you know it's coming and know it could be awful so you just accept it and try to plan with that knowledge. I also have a toddler and my wife and I are working to get somewhere that should be more stable as he is older (we're in Texas). We aren't certain where we'll go yet, but likely northern Europe or Appalachia.

For a while, I tried to work on making the people around me realize what was going on, but that takes a lot of energy and I view that as kind of pointless now.

I do find some solace in the fact that the world has been really shitty in a lot of ways throughout history, and technology has made it so that even in catastrophe a person in a wealthy nation will probably be able to avoid a lot of the issues. Odds are, my toddler's life will be better than a slave's on a shitty plantation 200 years ago. 

One final thing that's been helpful to me is cutting people out of my life that are trying their best to make this as bad as possible. I realized it was stressful dealing with them knowing they're going out of their way to hurt my wife and child, and in every case the stress they created was greater than the benefit they provided.","2017-08-31 03:30:06","1","hammertime84","1747760426.3720262","climate hoax","manual"
