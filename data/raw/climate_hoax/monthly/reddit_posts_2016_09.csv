"53b5x6","climate","scientific","I need help debunking these ""sources"" from a climate change denier (x-post from /r/GlobalWarming)","A friend of mine is convinced that climate change is just a hoax, and that ""if you just look at the unaltered data"" you'll soon realize he's right.

These are the sources he cites:    
[Source 1](http://climatechangedispatch.com/new-paper-claims-no-pause-in-warming-but-unaltered-data-says-otherwise/) ""Climate Change Dispatch""    
[Source 2](http://www.freedom.news/2015-12-07-yes-global-warming-is-a-hoax-and-heres-the-proof.html) ""Freedom News""    
[Source 3](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/german-scientist-accuses-nasa-massive-alteration-temperature) ""CNS News""    
[Source 4](http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/01/proof_that_the_manmade_global_warming_theory_is_false.html) ""American Thinker""    

To be clear, I don't just want to attack the sources. That's an easy shot. The problem with simply attacking the sources, is that gives him an easy sidestep into ""well I trust it more than the liberal media!"". I'm looking to attack the data presented. I don't have the time to dig on all these different sources, and was looking for some help.","2016-09-18 06:49:26","14","11","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/53b5x6/i_need_help_debunking_these_sources_from_a/","True","mondayp","1747756659.658967","climate hoax","manual"
