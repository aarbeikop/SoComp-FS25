"567vxf","environment","emotional","We can vote on the questions for the next presidential debate","Apart from Trump's blatant denial of calling climate change a hoax, the issue of the environment was absent from the previous debate.  However, the format for the second debate allows for the public to submit and vote on questions.  There is a whole section on the site dedicated to enivonmental issues but only the questions with the most votes will be selected.  Please go and vote so this important issue is addressed by one of the people who will likely be leading our country before too long.
