"dh4617p","t3_695e22","695e22","climate","scientific","I read through the article and found it to be full of falsehoods and misleading statements. Below I give some examples, first with a quote from the article, then with the reason it is wrong.

> One of these scientists included Dr. James Hansen, a former NASA climatologist who is known by some as the ""father"" or ""grandfather"" of the climate change myth, as it was his ""Model Zero"" that first introduced the concept of global warming

Clear falsehood. The concept of global warming originated in 1896, by Arrhenius, a swedish scientist. It already had a long history when James Hansen came along.

> Hansen, Philip Jones, Michael Mann, et al. were all involved in trying ""to lower past temperatures and to 'adjust' recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming,""

Extremely misleading. The quotes suggest that the emails contains that phrase. They do not.

>On the other hand, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency conducted a survey in 2015 that found that only 43 percent of scientists believe in man-made climate change, which is far from a consensus. 

Clear falsehood. The question 'do you believe in man-made climate change' wasn't even asked in that survey. But in question 3a about 85% of respondents say that greenhouse gases have had a moderate or strong warming effect. That is clearly at odds with the quoted 43%.

> The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high. Data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows that the ""average [ice] extent over the month [of September] is one of the highest in the last decade,""

Clear falsehood. The linked article itself shows a graph with a clearly decreasing amount of ice.

All the other points also contain various falsehoods and true facts used to paint a misleading picture. If you find out an article contains one or two false statements, it is better to ignore the rest of the article altogether. There are a lot of writers that actually care about the truth, it is better to read their articles. For example:

http://history.aip.org/climate/index.htm

A very long read, but well written and afterwards you will actually understand a lot about climate change. It helped me to see the errors in many articles in the press.

There is only one accepted version of climate science that has passed the testing of the scientific method. Humans did not evolve cognitively and emotionally fast enough to be able to correctly process modern science.

The human intellectual flaws that cause motivated reasoning and cognitive dissonance have also been studied. It's hard to change a deniers mind. ","2017-05-07 16:46:42","1","extinction6","1747759398.715507","climate hoax","manual"

Deniers don't have the critical thinking skills to change their opinions based on new evidence, they instead just double down on stupidity so they are not found out to be wrong. 
The human mind naturally protects itself from being wrong and many people don't study enough to achieve the intellectual flexibility required for accepting new information without suffering emotional discomfort.","2017-05-07 16:57:47","1","extinction6","1747759398.717723","climate hoax","manual"
