"d35a7st","t3_4jbigy","4jbigy","collapse","skeptical","Here's your problem:  You're trying to make Alex Jones make sense.

It's fascinating to watch how he tries to weave current events into his overall globalist narrative, but he doesn't care if there are holes or hanging threads, and neither does his audience.  It's all about what works *right now* to maintain or expand his audience and sell more water purifiers or whatever.

If anything, he is useful to the globalist elites because he keeps a segment of the population distracted, confused, emotionally raw but also perpetually inert.  They don't do much but listen and wait.  They don't trust their neighbours so they aren't likely to form any grassroots movements.  Not that an Alex Jones was created by the globalist elites, but he's there so they might as well take advantage.

I figure he partly believes and partly knows he's full of shit.","2016-05-14 14:59:24","30","candleflame3","1747755333.534276","climate hoax","manual"

Also, I think some of his globalist narrative about whats going on in US foreign policy isn't bad at all (he hits the mark on Russia, China and Syria by accident).  He disbelieves in global warming, but that is functionally fine with me, because I believe in global warming but disagree with carbon tax and cap and trade.  I think he gives the ""elites"" way to much credit for ""organizing"" all these things, as I don't believe in conspiracies, but I do believe in ""structural conspiracies.""  The elites are way more incompetent and out of touch with reality than he makes them.

The health stuff he sells is pretty useless too, but he does it to fund his operation.  Also many types like Alex jones believe the government is hiding ""free energy"" machines away and Tesla designs, which is absolute bullshit.","2016-05-14 14:32:56","7","Collapseologist","1747755333.539532","climate hoax","manual"

Meanwhile we anarcho-punx started a decent sized riot and at least made a serious attempt storming the gates and destroying the property of the elites.

Edit: I'm not saying that everything he says is BS. I do agree that 9/11 was an inside job, the Chemtrail hypothesis might hold water and ""The Elites"" are acutely aware of our pressing problems, have camps / places to hold people in interim, and are gearing up for another false flag, likely a Fake Alien Invasion, to execute plans involving the internment of vast numbers of Americans, along with the declaration of Martial Law. Whatever happens beyond that point is pure speculation, but it is coming, possibly very soon with economic collapse possible this year. 

Edit Again: 

Oh and yes powerful people are getting together and have a plan / plans in place to deal with the Human Over-Population problem, which is very real.

If you look at history, many of conspiracies that were considered absurd, too much or too evil turned out to be true. Snowden being one of the more recent one.

The problem I see, and this is a general human problem, is the confirmation bias. We try to seek confirmation for the opinion we already have and ignore counterfactual data. This is even affects science and is usually referred as a paradigm. If you look at physics for example, there are so many papers actually contradicting our standard model , but if you use a different one, you are seen as a nut job. It is absurd :)

Alex Jones is a problematic person. I think many of his theories are right, but many are simple against all facts. Climate change denial is one of them.","2016-05-14 20:13:40","1","poelzi","1747755333.561277","climate hoax","manual"

Years ago I followed Prison Planet's conspiracies down a few rabbit holes and they led me to the blogs of people who believed that extraterrestrials orchestrated all major events on earth. 

I've got two family members who have similar beliefs and who don't even know each other.
