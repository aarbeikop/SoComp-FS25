"d0euyq","climatechange","action-oriented","What can be responded to these statements of AGW sceptics?","I find myself again and again debating primarily on Facebook with AGW sceptics and deniers. I then link to sources from the IPCC and NASA to make my points. What can I say to statements like the following that are dismissing these as credible sources?

„IPCC is biased and can not be trusted. They will never come to a different conclusion than AGW because that’s their purpose of existence.“

„IPCC are not scientists, they are politicians with a left and green agenda.“

„Scientist working against AGW are silenced and their funds are cut.“

„These AGW-Scientists are biased because of their fund sources expecting certain outcomes. Unlike for example the Heartland Institute (or the German EIKE) that are telling the truth.“

„Your whole AGW-bubble just burst, as Dr. Mann lost in court. His hockey stick is now officially a fraud and he refuses to make his raw data and methods public.“ (Against this i have this: https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2019/8/28/1881956/-Tim-Ball-Pleads-For-Mercy-As-An-Irrelevant-Sick-Old-Man-Gets-It-Declares-Victory)

„There is still no proof for AGW. They just fail to deliver one, probably because AGW is a hoax.“

„All this climate hysteria is just to come up with new taxes to rip the small citizens off their money.“","2019-09-06 10:32:28","12","98","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/d0euyq/what_can_be_responded_to_these_statements_of_agw/","True","simpleasitis","1747770247.64994","climate hoax","manual"

"d8bc3s","collapse","skeptical","No Fall This Year Either: and No one Cares","It's late Sept, around 10 years ago where I lived that meant sweaters. I was housebound from heat two days ago, it was so humid and hot I could barely breathe and almost cancelled plans but it was early enough I made it, and I was home by 11, I didn't dare go out the rest of the day.  Now it's in the high 70s. That's liveable, but it is depressing to have the memories of fall gone, where there will be no leaves that turn, or cool nights, or just cooler weather that is moderate. I tried to talk to a few local people, I live in a most Republican area, and they all try to tell me global warming is a hoax. I said, ""My mind changed, watching the weather get hotter and hotter every year...look it's late September and we are still hot here"" One guy said they've paved over everything and that's why we feel the heat more, another lady said, well they haven't kept records long enough to know the long range cycles. If we follow the last two years, the trees will stay totally green into late October, and then there will be a lot of rain and they will change over in mid to late November and then it will be cold. They have not updated my state's websites much and still have already outdated information on the peak color.

It is a Midwestern state.....
” For fall 2019, color is expected to peak in********** between September 20 and October 14, 

This statement is laughable to me....

Last year the trees looked as green as August into late October.","2019-09-23 19:14:37","90","55","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d8bc3s/no_fall_this_year_either_and_no_one_cares/","True","fivehundredpoundpeep","1747770559.6952078","climate hoax","manual"
"da0d22","collapse","skeptical","What if climate change is used for oppression?","I believe global warming is real and our environment is screwed and we are looking at severe problems. Just some background, I am an ex fundamentalist Christian so keep this in mind, deconverted three years ago. I used to believe Agenda 21 was a problem, new world order, some conspiracy stuff too. Agenda 21 conspiracy theories, said that global elites were using climate change and that climate change was a hoax, meant to grab world resources and used for oppression. We were told in fundie circles that the elite wanted to do depopulation. [Think Georgia Guidestones and all that crap]. I escaped the fundies but I have had to deprogram myself from a lot of crap. I was in churches and very conservative communities where no one believed in climate change. Where I live now, only a few fellow liberals and UUs believe anything is going on. EVERYONE ELSE DENIES IT.

I of course changed from these views after studying science and no longer depending on a 2,000 year old book for reality testing. 

That said, what if the rich and powerful, decide to use climate change for a money clean out, and to oppress the poors. It would be easy for them to take the air conditioning away from poor people in first world nations ensuring more death and suffering and to change food to ""soylent green"", already food in America is processed into a bunch of low nutrition slop.  They could make rules oppressing the third world about the use of resources, access to food--probably some of that is already happening.

They could issue endless rules that still enrich themselves, while living in their giant mansions, and jet setting across the planet. I don't trust those assholes even now as a post-Christian agnostic to really fix anything. 

So they could issue edicts, that one can only eat meat once a week, air conditioning is stripped out--I'll be dead from severe lung problems and the constant heat--in the first world, deny cars and transportation---car-less city stuff freaks me out because I cannot walk well and destroy the food even more---I refuse to eat that GMOed to death 'impossible burger"" stuff they are pushing and make lives even harder using the environmental crisis to oppress people further.

They won't change or give anything up. They still want their endless vacations, new toys, consumerism and profit. I agree with people who say capitalism is unsustainable, but I hope people are realizing no ""world leaders"" are going to fix these problems. 

Grassroots may be the only way, but then what do you do about the fact that most lives are dependent on a modern industry? We live in a system where we need modern things to literally stay alive, like refrigeration, medicine, etc.

Instead of pouring money into war, and military, countries should be pouring money into researching and changing the system for environmental sustainability. My worry is their ideas for ""climate change"" will just be about oppressing the poor and still wanting to earn their billions in profit. Maybe I got left over fundie influences but I don't trust any rich or powerful people who only care about their status.

I live a life now with a low carbon footprint. I can go a year without leaving my county easy. I buy everything used even clothing if I can obtain it. I buy from vegetable stands and organic farmers. I can't grow my own food and don't have money to prep or do permaculture things but I do not live the same life as the ""typical American"". I am of the involuntary simplicity set.

There's a lot of waste and greed out there. So some folks have to change things on an individual basis. 

I think our society to deal with climate change, needs a more bottom up approach but then outside of a real grass roots movement to change society from the bottom up, where there's more attention to sustainability and more and reformating the economic system, and dedicating monies to research more then war for scientific solution, we are screwed. 

There's definitely no god in the Christian sense or a ""divine planner"" to have made an animal with the ability to screw up an entire planet just from trying to get it's emotional and physical needs met. 

By the way, I was not going to last with fundies too long as I love to read, and non-fiction at that. I read multiple books on climate change including ""The Water Will Come"", all this information CHANGED my MIND. 

Please tell me if you have concerns about leaders using climate change for oppression. Maybe this is just some left over vestiges of my fundamentalist indoctrination or maybe some of you have some of these concerns.

If you are Republican or denier, please don't answer this post, I've heard all that before. I am seeing and experiencing definite changes to the climate I live in that cannot be denied.","2019-09-27 13:24:27","45","59","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/da0d22/what_if_climate_change_is_used_for_oppression/","True","fivehundredpoundpeep","1747770562.6367218","climate hoax","manual"
"d86ein","collapse","skeptical","A disinformation ubiquity reminder","I recently posted a comment in my city’s subreddit discussing the climate strike last week. Mostly said “glad people came out but shit is fucked fam”. I was downvoted VERY quickly and got a reply stating that global warming is a hoax, not in the sense that it doesn’t exist, but that “they” have technological solutions, and are keeping them hidden to keep the masses enslaved.

My time spent here on r/collapse has opened my eyes to SO many things regarding how our society operates at a micro and macro level that I often take for granted. Before falling into the collapse knowledge pit I was ignorant simply from lack of awareness. I stopped using disposable plastics where I could and went a year without using a car in a place where one could argue you need it to function, i.e. not a super dense urban area, but I now know these changes are largely useless. 

It hurts when someone dismisses what we know because of some conspiracy shit they read online, or because they are optimistic about technology or the American Democratic Party (lol)

However a few years ago I was mostly in that same headspace. I knew global warming was an issue, I knew a forever expanding economy could not be, but I never truly thought about what this means for Earth’s current ecology and our global way of life. 

Rather than attempting further discussion with this conspiracy person specifically, I admit I just decided to ignore it.

Ignorance is bliss... for now, and while I definitely won’t stop talking about global HEATING and the collapse of everything we know and love and hate, I will be making an effort to stay cool in the head when people display their ignorance on the subject, since that’s where I was not long ago. 

So I guess this is a reminder mostly to myself and maybe to some of you, enjoy what we have, spread the word when you can, ignore the crazies, keep prepping if that’s your thing, and most importantly be careful what you believe :)

P.S. despite the temporary depression I dealt with which likely coincided with recognizing impending collapse, this sub has mentally liberated me and it’s one of the only places where I feel truths on soooo many different subjects are honestly discussed.
