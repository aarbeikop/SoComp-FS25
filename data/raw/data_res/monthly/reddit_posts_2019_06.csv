"bza1vf","sustainability","action-oriented","Slow Fashion Season 2019","The fashion industry is responsible for enormous amounts of water consumption (32 million Olympic size swimming pools per year) and CO2 emissions (8% of global greenhouse emissions - and growing fast). Textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of clean water globally, only after agriculture. Then there is the enormous waste creation (148 million tons by 2030) and land use (115 million hectares by 2030), and we haven’t even started on labour conditions yet... Enough numbers, time for action.

We are looking for **10,000 people** to participate in the **Slow Fashion Season**: we won’t buy any new clothes from 21 June to 21 September. By doing so, we will save up to 360 million liters of water and prevent 1.4 million kilogram of CO2 being emitted.

Join us by participating at [https://collaction.org/projects/slow-fashion-season-2019/129/details](https://collaction.org/projects/slow-fashion-season-2019/129/details)","2019-06-11 08:55:14","337","17","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bza1vf/slow_fashion_season_2019/","True","junobijlard","1747727357.404813","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"bx1y18","sustainability","action-oriented","Next week, over a thousand Citizens' Climate Lobby volunteers from all over America will descend on DC to lobby Congress for climate action | Today is a national call-in day to ensure these volunteers have their full attention","EDIT: If, for whatever reason, you can't get through today, it's not too late to call tomorrow or Friday. Lobby meetings will be Monday - Wednesday next week. 

______________________________

[Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/lobbying-for-the-greater-good/) is a grassroots, nonpartisan,  non-profit organization that trains everyday people to lobby their elected officials for [Carbon Fee & Dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend), a policy supported by notable climatologists like NASA's [Dr. James Hansen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8) and Penn State's [Dr. Michael Mann](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/). They've organized a national call-in day for today to ask Congress to pass [H.R. 763](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/763?s=1&r=27), which puts a price on carbon and returns the revenue to households as an equitable dividend. Please [call here](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/call-your-representative-about-the-energy-innovation-and-carbon-dividend-act/) to ask your elected leaders to support H.R. 763, and let us know when you've called so we know where we most need to grow our grassroots support.

Today is also World Environment Day, so wherever you live, please call your elected leaders and ask them to put a price on carbon which [the IPCC makes clear is necessary](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf) to meet our climate targets (or [raise the price](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/), if [it's too low](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emissions-prices/global-schemes-to-price-co2-emissions-worth-82-billion-world-bank-idUSKCN1IN0Z9)).","2019-06-05 12:24:15","173","5","0.98","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bx1y18/next_week_over_a_thousand_citizens_climate_lobby/","True","ILikeNeurons","1747727389.050137","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"bxqp0a","sustainability","action-oriented","We desperately need nuclear energy powering mass electric transportation; the Eurostar train is about as carbon-intensive per kilometer as walking","The Eurostar emits only 7.7 - 15 gCO2 per passenger kilometer. That's more efficient than jogging, and almost as efficient as walking when considering the calories burned per km, and the CO2/kg needed to produce food for a typical omnivore diet.

These figures are so low because the Eurostar (and TGV domestic train in France) are powered by electricity that is mostly generated from nuclear power. Renewables alone won't be enough. Nuclear waste is a problem, but not nearly as existential that posed by climate change. And with more efficient reactors, less waste is produced.
