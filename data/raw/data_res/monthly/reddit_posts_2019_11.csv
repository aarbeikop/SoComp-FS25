This is Oatly and we are trying to make it a law for food companies to label their products with their carbon emissions footprint.","Hello! This is Oatly and we are trying to make it a law for food companies to label their products with their carbon emissions footprint.

**TLDR: We have submitted a petition to the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) and we need 50,000 signatures by Monday, November 11th in order to force a debate.** You can sign here: ([https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/petitionen/\_2019/\_10/\_01/Petition\_99915.nc.html](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fepetitionen.bundestag.de%2Fpetitionen%2F_2019%2F_10%2F_01%2FPetition_99915.nc.html&data=02%7C01%7Cmaria.timander%40oatly.com%7C2c192c71b2c54efb1d3508d762be1f78%7C726d92b3a06f467d86e981b5d6b34600%7C0%7C0%7C637086441031930219&sdata=VjE4h8k3qXBGGxliulAqateZY9Es3OO1ZcNFDAAFfdw%3D&reserved=0))

So we wanted to let everyone on Reddit know that our petition asking the Bundestag to make co2 footprint food labels a law in Germany is actually open for anyone to sign, just in case you and your karma might be interested in helping 80 million fellow planetary humans make more climate friendly food choices.

**Right now, we’re a few thousand John Hancocks short of the 50,000 signatures we need by Monday, November 11th in order to force a debate in the Bundestag, so yeah, we kinda, sorta, totally need your help.**

Trouble is, the Bundestag site ([https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/petitionen/\_2019/\_10/\_01/Petition\_99915.nc.html](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fepetitionen.bundestag.de%2Fpetitionen%2F_2019%2F_10%2F_01%2FPetition_99915.nc.html&data=02%7C01%7Cmaria.timander%40oatly.com%7C2c192c71b2c54efb1d3508d762be1f78%7C726d92b3a06f467d86e981b5d6b34600%7C0%7C0%7C637086441031930219&sdata=VjE4h8k3qXBGGxliulAqateZY9Es3OO1ZcNFDAAFfdw%3D&reserved=0)) where you need to register for and sign the petition is entirely in German, which is annoying if you don’t have a brother in law from Cologne or an exchange student from Hamburg living in your basement to help out, but if you remind yourself of the badass stuff that climate activists sometimes do to make their voices heard, like chaining themselves to trees or handwriting angry letters with lots of exclamation points to public figures, then maybe using Google Translate won’t seem like such a nuisance. And to help you deal with any weird robot translations or bureaucratic snafus our consumer specialist, Mårten, is ready to answer any questions you might have, Just drop a comment to let him know you are stuck and he’ll do his best to get you unstuck.
