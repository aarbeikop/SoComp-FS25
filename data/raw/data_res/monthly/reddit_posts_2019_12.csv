In the late 1970s I was reading a premiere science magazine called OMNI.

It tried to sell me that AI Santa would live forever in geo-synchronous orbit making things from asteroids so we could live as immortal transhumans and a bunch of bullshit about electronic bhuddahs and stuff. In those days, a book called Sugar Blues was the most influential book in the world. Silent Spring was the other. I was always a Heavy Metal magazine fan. Even Penthouse magazine put out an article saying that American freedom would only last as long as there was plenty. I used to steal comics as a kid, and my friends would steal them from me.

Elon Musk is a 21st century Bananum Baily who does nothing more than blow smoke out of his ass. This guy is trying to build batteries in a desert with no water. Singapore is the most advanced city on earth. They are blessed with steep solid mountains and they are hollowing them out and moving underground. Singapore is a petrochemical nexus and a primary node where oil is shipped cooked and shipped again to become toxic laden petro nanoparticles that eat the blood lining in our brains. Singapore paid for Leonardo DiCaprio's career as a jet setting green ambassador, and we now know we can never doubt the presumptions of ambassadors.

Between the birth of the petroplastic and its granular dissolution as a nano particle inside our brains, comes the recycling stage, where it's shipped to Asia and Africa for burning and tossing. Of the 600 billion tons of plastic we made since 1950, 600 million tons have been recycled. Don't quote me on those numbers, they're unchecked because that would be pointless. That whole South East Asian ocean has a shit ton of oil in it. If 2 billion cars will be here by 2030, more oil will be made into chemcials and plastics by 2030 than burnt by the 2 billion cars we plan to have by then, and only 200 million of those cars will be electric.

China can spit out a nuclear reactor power plant barge in 5 years start to finish. They turn coal into gas so they won't choke on the smog. America suckered them into building smoggy cars, and now they are paying double time like they are wont to do. You can buy super boomer scooters for 15 hundred bucks there, no license required. America has become the number one exporter of oil, gas and coal with side orders of terror. So it's back and forth and back and forth until all plastic becomes nano sized.

The petrochemical burst was what made Monsanto and Bayer destroy the ecological structure of planet earth. All male vertebrates and insects are becoming female, stupid and sterile. This is where data bias and observation bias differ. Mathematical bias is obvious. Our models are only as good as our biases. Two examples are climate models and wind turbine models. The climate models left out methane because it was too difficult for their models. The newest giant wind turbines weren't modelled properly for top to bottom wind stress realities. It's hundreds of years after Newton and we're no better than apes staring at a human skull. We are not as advanced as we like to think, our technology preceeds our experiential potential, or some such shit.

**My Xmas Wish For Tomorrow**

100% private universal basic income = 100% private carbon wealth tax dividends = fuck the rich and the commies

100% private carbon UBI = 0% for corporations, NGOs and governments

100% UBI = unity equity liberty

Booble translate: The only way to handle the first billion is to tax the rich and cut out the government
