What is the net global CO2 emission projected to be for 2019, and/or what was the number for 2018?","2019-12-04 16:29:25","2","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e61phe/what_was_the_net_global_co2_emission_in_2018_2019/","True","Doug_Pringleton","1747731135.844796","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"e74x23","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","Broad danish coalition agrees on legally binding resolution to reduce CO2 emissions 70% by 2030 (from 1990 levels)","A broad danish coalition counting 167 of the 179 members of parliament have announced the first binding climate legislation in Denmark. 

The law will require Denmark to cut emissions by 70% before 2030 compared to the levels of 1990. 

The law have a binding partial goal due in 2025, and will be evaluated every year.
