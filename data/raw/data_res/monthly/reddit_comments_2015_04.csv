"cq7nf5v","t3_323yk3","323yk3","science","scientific","First off, the map graphic is very well done. Even though I consider myself knowledgeable on the subject, seeing the the graphic change for each question helped put in perspective how widespread each idea is. I have no doubt that if this graphic were distributed, it would have a global impact. So kudos on good work well done.

1. Is ""global warming"" to be used interchangeably with ""climate change""? The two imply subtly different ideas, with climate change typically including a broader range effects like oceanic acidification, and [this study, also in part by Dr. Leiserowitz, has shown people respond differently to each term.](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/global-warming-vs-climate-change/) Would you predict significant proportional changes in response or would you expect to see all figures rise or fall somewhat uniformly? 
2. I would consider rewording the response concerning beliefs among the scientific community to more directly imply that this is the public's beliefs concerning the scientific community's belief. At present it seems (to me) to convey that the data is the reported belief BY the scientific community rather than the population's perception OF the scientific community. [Another of Dr. Leiserowitz's studies demonstrates  up to 97% of the scientific papers published agree climate change is happening and human caused](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/scientific-and-public-perspectives-on-climate-change)
3. The ""already harming in the US"" question seems strange to me. I'm not sure how to answer that question. Smog in LA can potentially cause cancer or emphysema, but smog is a contributing factor to global warming rather than a result. Some studies have suggested certain marine ecosystems have been negatively affected by acidification but that's more of a climate change issue than specifically global warming. I'm not sure what present harm people could be citing when they say they believe it is presently harming us. Am I misinformed here, and something is presently affecting us negatively, or does this statistic demonstrate that, at least in some regard, general understanding of global warming is based out of fear rather than understanding? I understand also there are hugely dissenting theories on when we will begin to feel the effects of climate change.

I know I'm pushing it with a fourth question, but this is, in a sense, the most important. Do you believe we have a moral obligation to act in a certain consequence-conscious manner regarding issues of climate change? If we do have some obligation, how widely does it span? How could we justifiably act as individuals and as a world-community to sufficiently award praise and blame for actions with relevant consequences? (e.g. is it morally acceptable to reform industrial setting in a way which would be more difficult, stressful, or perhaps dangerous for human workers if emissions were significantly cut? Does diminishing the risk of an eventual potential global catastrophe (rising ocean levels, permanently destroyed ecosystems, specie-loss, up to eventual global extinction) justify the worsened human condition?

On a whole though, it's actually quite positive, at least if ""Policy support"" polls are based of a strong opinion and not just a knee jerk reaction to the issue. Because even if people are not strongly in favor of the scientific literature, at least they don't mind actions against the issue itself.

Can this tool be modified to also show ""Oppose"" answers to each question or perhaps the net of Support-Oppose?

The carbon tax question for example is 44-25 Support-Oppose, which is quite good for proponents.
