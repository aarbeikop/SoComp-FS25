It's doubtful I will change my answer. You had carbon that managed to be sequestered, which was no easy feat, and then we drilled down 3,000 feet to pump it up. Or maybe we leveled a mountain. 

I feel like people are going to take the offset money and then maybe plant some trees. Trees which will burn in a warmer earth or cut down 70 years from now. Or we bury it underground and the methane starts bubbling up and we think ...oh this was harder than we imagined - at least we got paid. 

I would rather pay more for wind, solar, or nuclear that reduce the need to dig up million year old carbon from deep beneath the earth in the first place. 

In fact, I would be eager to pay more for my electricity if it meant that it was supporting build out of new solar farms, wind turbines, or nuclear buildout. ","2018-08-09 15:18:45","4","BenDarDunDat","1747717452.590452","CO2 emissions","scientific"

"e3wtjz7","t3_95wi91","95wi91","environment","emotional","Depends. I would welcome a carbon tax or a tax added to fuel costs for everyone.  If it was an option at the pump to make you feel good about yourself (similar to buying credits for air travel) I would not do it.
