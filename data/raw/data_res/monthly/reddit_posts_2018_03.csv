"88ajxm","renewable","action-oriented","DECENTRALIZED ENERGY SYSTEMS AS THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY","Electric power systems around the world base on the principle of centralization. Large power plants that use natural gas, coal, various radioactive substances. The most environmentally safe of these are gas power stations, but they are huge sources of CO2 emissions. Power plants on radioactive substances pollute the world with harmful to human health radiation and substances, namely radioactive iodine, radioactive inert gases and aerosols. Coal-fired power plants can be called as ""deadly"" for environment due to the huge emissions of CO2, SO2, SO3, NO2, fine coal dust, various heavy metal aerosols: mercury, arsenic, lead, vanadium, and other harmful substances.
Renewable energy gives humanity hope for the future. The energy of the sun and wind does not produce harmful emissions, but this is not a constant. Biomass energy, converted to the electricity through the biogas production or direct combustion, allows to fill the energy balance of enterprises and individuals, supplementing the energy of the sun, wind, earth.
The using of inertia-free systems of accumulation of electric energy on the basis of capacitive batteries (the first large similar project is implemented by the innovator Elon Musk in Australia) changes the structure of electrical systems, allowing it to be more flexible and efficient.
The using of a combination of inertial-free systems of accumulating electric energy with ""green"" power plants allows solving the problem that companies owning high-voltage distribution networks prefer to keep silent, namely, the radiation of power lines with voltage above 35 kW, harmful to the biosphere of the planet (and people as its component).
The power plants on low-capacity biomass (0.5 MW - 10 MW) also have a number of advantages that can be realized in a decentralized energy system, namely:
1)possibility of recycling energy production waste on a power plant; CO2 - use of carbon dioxide for compact urban (suburban) farms operation, which increases their efficiency in the cultivation of various types of vegetables;
2) possibility of operating a power plant in the mode of trigeneration, namely the production of electric energy, as well as from the thermal energy that is produced in the process of producing electrical energy as ""production waste"", to produce heat energy (for heating of premises - water radiators or air heating and hot water systems production) in the cold season or refrigeration during the hot season (for air conditioning systems - air heating systems);
3) possibility of utilization of solid biomass combustion products - use of compact urban (suburban) farms for fertilizers;
4) possibility to use the organic constituent of human waste in combination with local biomass (from waste sorting enterprises) as a fuel;
5) simplicity in reliable supply of biomass power plants using road transport (small radius of biomass delivery increases economic efficiency of energy production), with such an additional advantage as the ability to use fully electric trucks to deliver biomass to a power plant.
In the aggregate of biomass power plants network, electric energy accumulating inertial-free systems solar and wind energy power plant network, we get:
1) possibility of a significant reduction in cost of electric networks, since the need for expensive high-voltage electric lines is reduced by 2-3 times;
2) possibility to abandon numerous natural gas supply lines for domestic needs, which is especially important in areas prone to seismic activity (and also increases the anti-terrorist security of residential areas);
3) opportunity to receive even cheaper electric (as well as heat or cold energy) energy for the population, small and medium-sized enterprises;
4) a significant reduction in CO2 emissions into the atmosphere of the planet;
5) reduction of environmental pollution by radio waves, emitted by high voltage transmission lines;
6) additional increase in reliability of power supply to the population and enterprises, typical for decentralized systems.

As an important element of such a future energy supply system, we are working on development of compact biogas power plants with biomass decomposition in pyrolysis boilers, which allows to utilize contaminated and partially toxic biomass. The 100 kW unit has successfully operated for 13 months at full load, showing the efficiency of our developments in the purification of pyrolysis gases (the main problem of such installations). Next to be done: units of 500 kW and 2.5 MW, based on which it will be possible to create compact power plants up to 30 MW of electric power for power supply systems. The relevance of our trigenerators has been increasing due to climate change, as protection from heat becomes more and more urgent. Our trigenerators will also be especially relevant for countries of Africa and countries with hot climate.
