I work at a blood bank, so I measure blood pressure a lot, but generally speaking only once per person per visit. Recently it was published (yet again) that blood pressure tends to be lower when it's hot ([pubmed abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26089227)). So I'm guessing the temperature that people are exposed to is one of the things that you are logging...

Is it true that glaciation has only relatively existed in the past 250k years of the Quatenary Glaciation.  

Though we often cite only the recent 10k years on temp changes and carbon in the atmosphere on climate change studies.  I thought we have ice cores going back millions of years?

And that we have an average warming period documented in the Middle Ages prior to the industrial revolution  


Source of reading on my interest of the historical North American climate.

https://www2.nau.edu/rcb7/nam.html
The images presented here show the paleogeography of North America over the last 550 million years of geologic history. The 40 images shown here are selected from a suite of approximately 100 maps that are in time slices mostly 5-10 million years apart. By using such tightly spaced time slices, individual paleogeographic and tectonic elements can be followed and intuitively related from time slice to adjacent time slice. Because of space limitations only 40 of the 100 images are presented here but but most shifts of tectonic elements and depositional systems can still be followed. The maps were prepared with the core of North America (Laurentia) fixed. All other tectonic elements are shown moving against or splitting away from Laurentia, thus showing clearly accretionary and rifting events in North America's geologic history. The views were prepared by wrapping a rectangular outline map on a sphere and viewing the globe rotated to 35° N and 100° W. Various stratigraphic, tectonic, and sedimentologic data were added to the map. Topography was ""cloned"" from digital elevation maps of modern Earth from the USGS, NOAA, and other sources. Colors were adjusted to portray climate and vegetation for the given time and location. The geologic data were gathered from the references listed below.

"ctptwvi","t3_3flzb4","3flzb4","science","scientific",">most climate model data used in comparisons to observations samples the air temperature at 2m over land and ocean. 

This seems to be a very important distinction, and I'm amazed that the observation that the models and observations were actually showing different measurements has not been made public before this.  

There has been a claim that most of the warming i the last 15 to 18 years has gone into the oceans below the surface, and that's why the models and observations have diverged over that time period.  There are models of projected sea temperature changes, and I believe those models do not model the air 2 meters above, but actual water temperatures. 

Given that the models that we are normally presented with have historically depicted air temperatures, and 71% of the planet is ocean, where air temperatures are not measured, but water temperatures are, and given that we know that the ocean depths are warming, but water takes a lot more energy per unit temperature change, is the current use of air temperature at the surface in any way a reasonable way to depict Climate Change?  

The biggest, most often used warning issued by Climate Scientists and activists is that the world will warm by 3º ± 1.5º C after a doubling of CO2.  But, is that ""air temperature, 2 meters off the ground?"" and if we're not measuring the air temperature, 2 meters off the ground for most of the planet, should we be using a different warning altogether?

Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are not a significant driver of global warming.  CO2 gas holds far less energy/heat than water vapor, and water vapor of course is present in staggering amounts in our atmosphere. So basically all the CO2 we've put into the air is a mere drop in the bucket and insignificant in driving climate change.

The primary driver of climate change is essentially cities, buildings, roads, parking lots, etc which absorb an absurdly high amount of solar radiation when compared to the plant life that would have been in it's place.

So he is saying that humans drive climate change but we are erroneously fixated on CO2 because the graphs people make linking CO2 and global mean heat seem to correlate; an example of correlation but not causation.

One.

In my opinion, your biggest challenge in getting the public to accept your climate modeling will be getting them to first understand the greenhouse effect.   Are there any efforts to do this?

Two. I saw the 2007 Arctic summer ice melt as one of the turning points over the last decade. I got the sense that a lot of scientists and politicians realized that events could be accelerated decades ahead of expected predictions.

According to Wise's calculations linked to above, if we want to stop climate change, but also want 9 billion people by 2050 to have the standard of living the EU has in 2007, CO2 per dollar of GDP will have to decline from 768 in 2007, to just 14 grams per dollar by 2050.

That looks really difficult to me on first sight, so I have the following questions:

Is it really possible to reconcile the desire for economic growth with the desire to address climate change?

As both a moderator here and somebody who frequently spends (perhaps ""wastes"") a lot of timing debating with climate change deniers online, it's clear to see that many of the online commenters are just the tip of a mass media effort to redefine climate change as a political argument in order to detract from the science and make the implications of climate change something to dismiss as socialist/liberal alarmism. Many popular mass media publications regularly ridicule the scientists and science of climate change, and anyone that accepts the science in general, all the while driving home the point that it's a political issue, not a scientific or even societal one. Then reaching further up the ladder, we see entire political parties express almost venomous hate toward anything climate science, while even the governments that claim to believe the science are still mostly allowing and often encouraging fossil fuel explorations.

The plan to *prevent* meaningful action on climate change does appear to have been an enormous success.

So, my main question is, what will it take to change this?

Protesting and writing letters to our representatives doesn't appear to have done enough so far. Often it seems that people are even more politically entrenched in their opposition to climate change actions nowadays than a decade ago.

I've seen many mainstream news articles about the latest dire climate science that report the findings accurately, and then conclude by suggesting (often by citing a quote from you) that a carbon price will be enough to prevent the worst.

A carbon fee-and-dividend, as Citizens' Climate Lobby proposes, seems like a great first step, but it seems clear that much more is needed, very soon, to draw down emissions as rapidly as necessary to prevent a rise of 2C or more (and even more to avoid 1.5C, as you advocate).

Other climate scientists like Michael Mann have advocated for an [economic mobilization on the scale of the American World War II mobilization](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org) to eliminate and withdraw excess greenhouse gas emissions, and a growing number of people, including CCL founder Marshall Saunders, are [signing a pledge](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/notable_pledge_signers) to endorse this platform and build toward the massive political will necessary to achieve it in the U.S.

Do you agree with their assessment that such a mobilization is necessary?

I've been feeling conflicted lately, so I just have a quick question. It's true we need to start taking action, and with all of this attention drawn to needing an **urgent** reduction in GHG, I find it frustrating that some drivers get ignored. I recently came upon a number of studies that put animal agriculture as a very major driver of climate change,^[1](http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0612sp1.htm),[2](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)  and that they will only get worse^[3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v515/n7528/full/nature13959.html). How can we tackle the contributions to carbon dioxide emissions due to animal agriculture, and should this be something we deal with as a nation? Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.^[4](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294) As a very politicized topic, is it ever possible for our government to endorse a slow reduction of consumption of animal products, or a similar initiative? How can we ardently push for reduction in transportation and reorganization of our energy sources (which I completely agree with) but willingly ignore this very integral part of climate change?

"cu0cmvd","t3_3gporh","3gporh","science","scientific","A multi-meter rise in ocean levels seems beyond the usual claims, so to what extent would a multi-meter rise in ocean levels mitigate ocean acidification?

It's scientifically clear that anthropogenic warming is happening, but it seems less clear to me that the consequences will be a global cataclysm for humans. By which I mean, possibly many areas will experience increased drought, possibly many areas will experience increased storm frequency and intensity, possibly many species in the oceans would die from increased acidification, and consequently we would probably see drastically reduced biodiversity.

However, none of the above necessarily entails that *many human lives would be lost* due to climate change, which is what most people care about. Drought is handled by transportation or relocation, storms are handled by construction or relocation, and loss of biodiversity is handled by our reliance on agriculture. So even if climate engineering were to fail, our other means of mitigating the problems aren't necessarily inapplicable simply because the climate changes. Would you agree with this assessment? I think this belief that humans aren't really at risk may hold many people back from endorsing swift and immediate change.

I endorse change simply because tens of thousands of people per year *already die* from air pollution in the US alone, which is a *real and quantifiable cost* we're paying right now. The costs of anthropogenic warming seem less clear by comparison, and if you can't quantify it in real terms as being *even more costly* than the tens of thousands of lives per year we're clearly already willing to sacrifice, then convincing such people would be difficult indeed.","2015-08-12 13:52:01","4","naasking","1747741298.329581","climate data","scientific"

"cts266c","t3_3dwrac","3dwrac","sustainability","action-oriented","Great argument. I've honestly not heard many arguments from your side of the fence about agriculture. I have to agree that we should make food as efficiently as possible, with as little impact to our health and the land. I don't have a problem with GMOs as long as they are well tested (I did hear that many of the strains coming from Monsanto have certain genes that may be bad for humans in subtle ways. [This isn't the original article I read, but one i found quickly](http://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/regulators-discover-a-hidden-viral-gene-in-commercial-gmo-crops/)) and I think that they hold the key to a lot of agricultural improvement.

I'm glad that there are people in the industry like you who seem to be very level headed on the issue, but I also think that there are some general issues with farming trends that Organic farming purportedly improves. In the 100% profit driven market of farming that we see in the US, there doesn't seem to be a huge push for improving nutritional value of foods. I think the rise of mono-cultures in farming is probably a bad thing (how many of those diseases/plights from that TED talk might have been mitigated if we had greater biodiversity, do we know?). I think that farmers are still given incentive to inefficiently fertilize (e.g. getting the last 5% yield requires 50% more fertilizer but the economics still work out), leading to massive ocean dead zones which do nothing to the farmers profits but has a large societal costs (and costs to fishing industry).  I like that organics promote seasonal and local consumption, which I've been hearing more about the benefits of lately.

My question is, How do I support these sorts of improvements in agriculture in a way that doesn't blindly support organic farming, including it's demerits. I currently subscribe to a CSA and I think it is the best I can do. I assume they use organic methods for farming and strive for minimalist impact on the land. It also avoids a large amount of food waste from distributors, even if I do receive some strange looking fruits/veggies on occasion. They may be much less efficient in terms of yield, but I believe they are still probably ""better"" in terms of energy input (specifically fossil carbon produced), total toxins released and water used, per calorie grown.
