I'm here to talk about the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season specifically as well as any other hurricane/typhoon related questions you have. Ask me anything!","I am Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. I worked for over 15 years with the late Dr. Bill Gray, a renowned scientist who conducted groundbreaking studies in hurricane genesis, structure and intensity change as well as pioneering Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane prediction.  While our [Tropical Meteorology Project](http://tropical.colostate.edu) is best known among the general public for the seasonal hurricane predictions, I conduct research on a variety of hurricane-related topics including shorter-term prediction as well as potential future changes in tropical cyclone activity driven both by natural variability as well as anthropogenic causes.  I maintain a very active presence on social media through my Twitter feed (@philklotzbach) where I provide frequent updates on current global tropical cyclone activity and compare them with historical statistics.  I also maintain [global real-time hurricane statistics](http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Realtime/).  In cooperation with the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, I helped create a [repository of all publicly-available seasonal hurricane forecasts](http://seasonalhurricanepredictions.org/) for the Atlantic basin from various government agencies, universities and private forecasting companies.

Currently, I am working on a variety of research projects, including the generation of an updated global tropical cyclone climatology as well as a paper on the life and legacy of Dr. Gray. I am also closely monitoring the potential shift away from the active Atlantic hurricane era that we have been in since 1995. I was lead author on a paper last year that raised the question that we might be moving out of the active era for Atlantic hurricanes.

I look forward to chatting with you about all things hurricane!

**I’ll be back at noon EST (9 am PST, 5 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!**","2016-10-13 11:59:35","3361","304","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/579v6t/science_ama_series_hi_reddit_im_phil_klotzbach_a/","True","AmGeophysicalU-AMA","1747764416.622838","climate data","scientific"
