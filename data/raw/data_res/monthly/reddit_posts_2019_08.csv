"cri7pj","climatechange","action-oriented","We should abolish lawns","The fact that we still have lawns full of short grass that we methodically mow once a week is a significant contributor to climate change. 

Firstly, by replacing whatever natural vegetation would grow in the area with short grass, we reduce the land's ability to take in CO2. By preventing the grass from growing tall, we significantly reduce the amount of CO2 we keep out of the atmosphere, and prevent native ecosystems from developing. Even if grass grows at the same rate whether it's constantly mowed or not, we could replace lawns with forests to fight climate change.

But secondly, and more importantly, lawn mowing consumes a huge amount of resources. In addition to the CO2 produced by the fossil fuels in lawn mowers (or the equivalent energy cost of electric lawnmowers), fertilizers produce nitrous oxide, a very powerful greenhouse gas.

According to https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa8nan/your-well-manicured-lawn-is-contributing-to-climate-change, a maintained lawn contributes about as much to climate change as a transatlantic flight. If 100 million homes in the US stopped maintaining their lawns, that would put a pretty large dent in total greenhouse gas emissions, and that's not counting planting trees to replace the lawns with forests. It's an area no one seems to be talking about, but it seems like we could get a decent impact just by telling people to stop doing something.","2019-08-17 05:41:16","205","86","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cri7pj/we_should_abolish_lawns/","True","The_Starfighter","1747728313.516973","CO2 emissions","scientific"
