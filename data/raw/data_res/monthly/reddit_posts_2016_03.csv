AMA!","Hi Reddit,

We're Margaret Kosmala and Koen Hufkens at Harvard University and Josh Gray at Boston University. We're part of a research group that has been putting automated cameras on weather towers and other elevated platforms to study the the seasonal timing of changes in plants, shrubs, and trees – called 'phenology'. Because this timing of when plants leaf, flower, and fruit is very sensitive to changes in weather, plant phenology alerts us to changing climate patterns. Our network of about 300 cameras ('PhenoCams') take pictures of vegetated landscapes every half hour, every day, all year round. (That's a lot of pictures!) With the data from these images we can figure the relationships between plant phenology and local weather and then predict the effects of future climate using models. 

We also use images from satellites to broaden the extent of our analyses beyond the 300 specific sites where we have cameras. And we use citizen science to help turn our PhenoCam images into usable data, through our [Season Spotter project](http://seasonspotter.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit). Anyone can go to Season Spotter and answer a few short questions about an image to help us better interpret the image. Right now we are running a “spring challenge” to classify 9,500 images of springtime. With the results, we will be able to pinpoint the first and last days of spring, which will help calibrate climate change models.

UPDATE: We're done with our Season Spotter spring images, thanks! Since it's fall in half the world, we've loaded up our [fall images](http://seasonspotter.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit). We have another 9,700 of those to classify, as well. 

We'll be back at 1 pm EDT (10 am PDT, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions; we're looking forward to talking to you about climate change, plants, and public participation in science!

UPDATE 1 pm Eastern: We're now answering questions!

UPDATE 3 pm Eastern: Josh has to leave for a meeting. But Koen and Margaret will stick around and answer some more questions. Ask away if you have more of them.

UPDATE 5 pm Eastern: Koen and I are done for the day, and we've had a lot of fun. Thank you all for so many insightful and interesting questions! We'll try to get to more of the ones we missed tomorrow.","2016-03-31 11:24:04","2908","449","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4cpl6d/science_ama_series_we_are_margaret_kosmala_koen/","True","Seasonspotter","1747756497.5271082","climate data","scientific"
"4bm28u","science","scientific","PLOS Science Wednesday: Hi Reddit, my name is Wan Yang, and I developed a forecast system that predicted the timing and magnitude of flu epidemics in Hong Kong -- Ask Me Anything!","Hi Reddit,


My name is [Wan Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/wanyangblog/), and I am an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University’s [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). I use mathematical and statistical methods to study how infectious diseases (e.g. influenza and Ebola) spread through populations and develop methods to predict them.


My colleagues and I published a paper, [""Forecasting Influenza Epidemics in Hong Kong""](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004383) in the journal [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/). Hong Kong has a humid subtropical climate and is a known global epicenter for flu. Unlike the U.S., where flu is seasonal, the timing of flu outbreaks in Hong Kong and similar climates is highly irregular—making prediction particularly challenging. Using data from 1998 to 2013, we developed two forecast systems for Hong Kong. We were able to predict the timing and magnitude of flu epidemics and the 2009 pandemic with accuracy near that achieved for the U.S.<http://cpid.iri.columbia.edu/> Our findings suggest that forecast of irregular infectious disease epidemics (e.g. the flu epidemics in Hong Kong) is possible.


I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET, AMA!

EDIT: Hello, everyone! I'm gonna start answering questions now :)

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the great questions!  I had a great time answering them.  Now I'm signing off.

E.G:  
Watson: I have these plans for a solar panel power planet for myself and robots to maintain them, could you sort that out quickly before you go?

Deepmind: I have these plans for self driving and repairing solar powered roads and automobiles that I could run for you, could you sort that out quickly before you go?","2016-03-10 23:21:39","10","45","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/49w380/so_what_if_we_gave_all_the_science_and_data_to/","True","Arowx","1747756729.9564888","climate data","scientific"
