In some quarters, there has been suggestion that Mars continues to have an evolutionary climate, with some planetary features dated to less than 1 million years old. What factors could be driving climate change on Mars? On the Earth, Milankovitch Cycles  caused by variations in rotational inclination, procession of the pole and eccentricity of the orbit change the amount of sun the Earth gets at critical latitudes and drive the amount of ice/snow melt and eventually ice ages. Presumably Mars has similar cycles. Where is it in its own Milankovitch cycle right now? Is it about as warm as it gets;   Or could you expect a warmer climate as the various factors on Mars change over time?","2015-07-17 15:58:57","2","shiningPate","1747740494.8101509","climate data","scientific"
