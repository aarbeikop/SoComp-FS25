Your climate denier friend is either open to new information or he will double down on his stupidity. Climate science deniers are scientifically illiterate and most are not willing to look at the real science. Studies by people like Dan Kahan at Yale show that many people suffer from motivated reasoning and their minds will never accept that climate change science is real. Human minds have a lot of cognitive flaws and this may cause our extinction.

""2014 Hans Jenny Memorial Lecture: Chris Mooney, ""The Science of Why We Don't Believe in Science""

There is only one accepted version of science the world over. The laws of gravity and thermodynamics are the same for all accredited scientists and organizations, and political borders are meaningless.

Science is proven and accepted using the ""Scientific Method"" which you can Google.

There is not one academy of science anywhere in the world that disputes the reality of anthropogenic climate change and your friend cannot find one.

Most deniers are so far removed from the scientific process that they have no idea what is involved and they think their sources can just make up data as they see fit. 

Here is an excellent presentation by Richard Alley for the National Academies of Science and this explains why CO2 is most important to our challenge. The Sun's energy being insignificant is mentioned briefly. Getting a climate science denier to watch this and accept the science is nearly impossible though as usually their lazy minds are made up and they don't want to admit any fault.

It is my understanding that crows can drive other species out of an area, and I believe we're watching it happen. I am already seeing fewer of some species. (Our annual cardinal family has disappeared!) The mockingbirds have a perch that has become a battle zone - and almost every day I've seen as many as 3 at a time attack a crow for invading. 

My question(s): is there anything (humane) I can do to make the crows not want to move in? I hate to sound ""crowist,"" but frankly, their songs aren't as pretty as the birds they're pushing out. Could this possibly be a temporary home for them? Or should I just get used to the crows? 

It's the loss of the other birds that bothers me the most. And the mockingbirds can only do so much to keep the crows away. They're trying, but I wonder if it is futile. So is there anything I can do outside of watching the show?
