"bmo4o2","sustainability","action-oriented","Raising a bit of awareness :)","From my perspective and what I know( I study Enviromental Engineering at univesity) the biggest *INDIRECT* pollution comes from buildings being inadequatly insulated and engineered.

The fact is we get heat from burning fossil fuels and even renewable sources have a ""carbon footprint"", so if you are truly aware of the problems, you should know that around 30% of energy we generate is being used on heating and cooling our living spaces, and that leaves a hefty carbon footprint.

Pic is from college presentation we study from, subject is called Energy management.

Edit: 

Some sources say that buildings consume around 40% of the total energy produced in the world, ""around 30%"" may just have been for Croatia or the EU . One source is [https://www.iea.org/topics/energyefficiency/buildings/](https://www.iea.org/topics/energyefficiency/buildings/)  , which also states that buildings are responsible for 40% of the emissions of CO2

Also, apologies for my un-scientific expression, it is not ""*INDIRECT pollution""* but rather just emission, because I did not talk about waste in this post.

BTW, first post :D

"brm5mj","sustainability","action-oriented","Should the CO2 footprint of employment factor into purchasing decisions of consumer goods?"," If my employer pays me £80 per day, and I can estimate the CO2 footprint of doing my job, compared not working, is around 15Kg CO2e. So my earnings have a footprint equivalent to 180g CO2e per £. (This might be from my daily commute, chunky work computer, office AC and whatever it is that my company actually does)

If I wish to buy a new car, then electric is the low CO2 choice, but they cost upwards of £20,000 or £30,000 with finance. I would have to work loads to afford it, and so generate more employment CO2e, 5,400Kg CO2e.

Alternatively a cheap secondhand car for £2,000 to £3,000 is more affordable, and although more polluting than an electric car, would only require ten times less employment CO2e 540Kg CO2e

Now the electric car choice over a petrol car would reduce my personal CO2 emissions, but if the choice was for something that only marginally affects my personal CO2 emissions, like a mobile  phone or a laptop, then the CO2e from employment is more significant.","2019-05-22 08:31:34","25","3","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/brm5mj/should_the_co2_footprint_of_employment_factor/","True","illandancient","1747726745.370396","CO2 emissions","scientific"
