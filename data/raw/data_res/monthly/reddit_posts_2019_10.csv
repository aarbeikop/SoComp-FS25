What is the procedure for countries like the Vatican or Lesotho?

What sort of equipment is used to ascribe a CO2 emissions total to a tested geographic location? What is the tolerance for this in kilometers? What is the tolerance in highly developed but geopolitically ambiguous areas like Hong Kong?","2019-10-12 19:33:57","0","23","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dgzr0k/how_do_i_discern_the_vaticans_per_capita_co2/","True","apocalypsetruck","1747729516.072611","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"do0jlg","climatechange","action-oriented","Here’s a Mega-List of reputable sources proving climate change is very real.","EDIT: I suppose the title should say “proving that humans are causing climate change.” 

——

I recently encountered a climate change denier in the wild and thought, “You know what, there are plenty of reputable sources out there that agree that climate change is real and being caused by humans. I’m going to collect a list of those sources and show them to this person.”

So I did, and I wanted to share this mega list with you, to better arm you to help people accept what is happening to our planet. So here goes:

EDIT: a lot of these sources also talk about the causes of climate change, and the fact that climate change is being primarily caused by human CO2 emissions. Many also cover additional evidence of human caused climate change.","2019-10-27 22:59:04","164","134","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/do0jlg/heres_a_megalist_of_reputable_sources_proving/","True","TheJoshWatson","1747729625.261278","CO2 emissions","scientific"

The company I work for wants to change it’s company car to an electric one, more specifically a Tesla, but our CEO isn’t sure if it’s everything it’s cracked up to be.

I read online that the Tesla S for example has the same amount of emissions as an average car in the UK. Of course that statement alone has too many variables to make an accurate comparison, so I thought I’d reach out to you guys!

What have you found within your research? Are Teslas actually better for the planet than a diesel or petrol car?","2019-10-29 19:11:21","7","17","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/doukp4/tesla_cars_actually_better_for_the_planet/","True","thatsomethinglife","1747730084.032876","CO2 emissions","scientific"
