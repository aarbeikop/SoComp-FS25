Just like this for co2 ppm [ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2\_annmean\_mlo.txt](ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.txt)   

Are there similar txt files for mean temperature? Preferably year by year.      

In general, which is the go-to site for these kind of data?     

\[Trying to do something with this data as part of my Matlab coursework\].    

Many thanks.","2019-10-17 15:52:36","5","5","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dj8axs/where_can_i_get_all_the_climate_related_raw_data/","True","president_of_neom","1747824247.882638","climate data","scientific"
