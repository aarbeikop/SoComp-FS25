I studied the environmental impact (GHGs and water consumption) of foods for my masters... it gets complicated quickly and there isn't a super clean, easy answer (especially when comparing between products of the same grouping, i.e. a carrot vs. a zucchini). Production data is aggregated by food type (cattle ranching, fresh fruit farming, beans/grains/nuts, etc.) and by nation. These categories are the easiest to look at when deciding the most environmentally conscious way of eating. 

Check out Carnegie Mellon's [input-output LCA calculator](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/use.pl).

I know you mentioned emissions, but please keep in mind that there are a number of other environmental impacts that you could and should consider, such as water use, impact on biodiversity, land use, toxicity, etc. So even if fish has a low emissions profile in general, it's not necessarily ""better for the environment"" than eating chicken - it inevitably involves a value judgment.

You probably already know, but in general it's the following, worst to best:
- beef/lamb/pork
- dairy
- grains/nuts/seeds
- eggs/chicken
- veggies
- fruits

The units also matter - measuring by kcal is going to be tough to find, since most of the data is economic data. You're more likely to find impact per dollar.
