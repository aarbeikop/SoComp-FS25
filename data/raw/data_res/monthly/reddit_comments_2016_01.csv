2 - Another question touched on the subject of overall mapping of the ocean on the surface and below, are we coming closer to an understanding the fluctuation in pressures at extreme depths also relevant to the increase/decrease in heights.

We're often told that the Arctic is warming faster than most places on the planet, but

1) How do both NOAA and NASA handle surface temperatures over/under sea ice? Air temps or water temps or not at all? In the NOAA graphic in particular the Arctic seems to be a large ""grey area""!

2) How, if at all, do the satellite and radiosonde graphs on slide 10 incorporate data from above the Arctic?

"cz6hakt","t3_41zr2t","41zr2t","science","scientific","Let me preface this by saying that climate change is absolutely real and the amount of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere is more likely than not causing global warming. 

That said, after reading and interpreting the Vostok ice cores experiment from which a lot of climate change theory is based on, why are we so preoccupied with yearly fluctuations of temperatures? The predictions clearly show that the levels of CO2 operate on a time lag with assumed temperature differences, on an order of thousands of years.

Even quibbling about that, the CO2 cycle for the earth is approximately 100,000 years long. We can quote records as much as we want but scientists that rely on making assessments about global health based on computing yearly data seems incomprehensible to me. Why are we so concerned with (relatively) minor fluctuations around the mean when in truth people are worried about the greater trend for the future - looking forward thousands of years?
