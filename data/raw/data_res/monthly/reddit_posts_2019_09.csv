► If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% in your lifetime. 

► If you are 30 years old, emissions went up 60% in your lifetime. 

► After 30 years trying, solar and wind are < 3% of total world energy use.

► Claire Fyson said emissions must go down 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 1.5° C. 

► The Insurance Journal said they must go down 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 3.0° C.

► Stefan Rahmstorf said emissions must go down 100% in 20 yrs to avoid 2.0° C. 

► Hans Schellnhuber said 5 of 13 major hothouse tipping points start below 2.0° C. 

► When these 5 points are triggered, they trigger the other 8.  

► This results in runaway hothouse, which can't be stopped or reversed once started.  

► But we are also headed for runaway mass extinction, which can't be stopped or reversed once started. 

► 10,000 years ago humans and livestock were 0.03% of land vertebrate biomass. 

► Today humans and livestock are 98% of land vertebrate biomass. 

► Human/livestock food production caused 80% of land vertebrate species extinctions. 

► Petrochemical use grows 7X faster than human population.","2019-09-19 13:23:33","912","300","0.98","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d6dzoi/the_ultimate_doom_post_just_kidding_its_worse/","True","CommonEmployment","1747729184.758181","CO2 emissions","scientific"

It was pretty absurd at first because it happened at 5pm... Yes, a work/school strike that begins after work/school.

Once we got past the weirdness and joined in, it became immediately apparent that Japan didn't have a very large base of people that were particularly concerned about this. Of course, part of that might be the language/cultural barrier, which means they are more likely to organise their own protests than jump on the back of world protests, but I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. We were, after all, in a country where many things sold are triple-wrapped in plastic and then handed over in a plastic bag. Not to mention all the coffee shops we saw where all the customers were sitting indoors, drinking from disposable coffee cups.

Mind-you, as far as I'm aware, they do a good job with their CO2 emissions, so I'm probably focussing on the small issues. Also, I'm relatively new to understanding these issues, so I'm not the best person to pass judgement. Nevertheless, once it kicked off, a huge number of people joined in. It was by no means anywhere near the numbers seen in other countries around the world, but it certainly wasn't fruitless.

It was odd how we had to wait for traffic and it took a while for the politeness of the Japanese culture to wear off enough for the chants to get going, but once it did, the march was great! It gained quite a bit of attention and it turned out that we were marching through rush hour, going through one of the busiest crosswalks in Japan, in the city of Shibuya.

We made a video of our experience in the march here if you're interested to check it out:

It's super interesting to see the change in atmosphere when the march properly kicks into gear.","2019-09-26 05:09:28","118","7","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/d9f3m5/tokyos_climate_strike_happened_at_5pm_but_at/","True","GeekBite","1747729414.887001","CO2 emissions","scientific"
