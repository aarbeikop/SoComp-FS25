"d9i99e2","t3_5apf20","5apf20","science","scientific","I just looked at your paper and something concerns me standing out.  Niche theory already has issues because many tests of niche theory tend to fail when stacked against null distributions.  In other words, what you observe with Niche models is not necessarily different than what you would see by random chance (see Tilman 2004 and Rosindell et al. 2013).  Granted these sources refer to community models, but presence absence of particular populations (or strains) may be stochastically structured depending solely on dispersal factors and random differentiation, not on any Grinellian niche factors.  Hence, it may not be that there are any relevant ecological factors other than dispersal distance (as you already mention).  Consequently, the phylogeographic spread of the disease and its strains may not be predictable along any environmental gradient and thus hinder forecasting.

These factors should be partialed out from each other and analyzed seperately and not assumed to be solely niche process a priori.  Not everything is solely niche determined.  What tests did you perform to do so if you did any?  Did you run any variance partitioning (Legendre and Legendre 2012) to determine the contribution of broad scale environmental factors compared with spatial distances and other spatial factors?","2016-11-02 12:43:52","30","feedmahfish","1747765851.953362","climate data","scientific"

"d9idu9k","t3_5apf20","5apf20","science","scientific","This is awesome. I'm actually writing a research paper right now on Methods in Disease mapping. I just have a couple questions. 

1. What program did you use to compile your data/build your model, I didn't see it in the paper?
2. Did you take into account mutations of the virus and what factors/vectors could lead to these mutations?
3. Did you use multiple iterations/how many iterations did you run of the model to predict the likelihood of the disease spreading?
4. What modifications could and would you make to the model if you were researching a different virus, or even bacterial disease? 

These questions may seem really simple but I don't have time to read the entire paper before 1 oclock, and I'm really into the topic of this AMA.
