"dblaenw","t3_5k3upu","5k3upu","climatechange","action-oriented","Do you mean the data as collected originally? or the data after it's been processed and adjusted?  Because the data that is used today is highly massaged.  Temperature data from before 1979 is pretty heavily lowered, for various reasons, and temperature data for after 1979 is homogenized and adjusted so that rural temperatures are raised up to match nearby cities.  This is all fairly well documented and defended by the keepers of the data.

I've stopped bothering to care what their charts say a while ago.  They say we've warmed by 1.2º over pre-industrial temps?  Okay, whatever.  Several years ago, it was 0.8º, but that got adjusted up by about 50% when they decided to adjust how we treated water temperature readings.

It could take a lot of years for one man alone to recreate the temperature adjustments used by the climate change industry and arrive at their current estimate of how hot we are.  If you used the raw temperatures, taken at stable sites, some parts of the world (the Southeast of the US, for example) show no warming AT ALL.  That can't be allowed to stand, so they adjust.","2016-12-24 20:24:09","3","deck_hand","1747766695.4658382","climate data","scientific"

>Judicial Watch announced today that it filed a lawsuit on December 2, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking records of communications from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) officials regarding methodology for collecting and interpreting data used in climate models (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Commerce (No 1:15-cv-02088)). 

The people who fund these climate organizations had to sue for the data(and methods).  To my knowledge, there is no public data set showing the raw unadjusted numbers or what methods they used on the released info. I too would love to see what the public would find with the raw data. I've been looking for a very long time, but to date, I've only read about lawsuits and bullshit regarding this shit.

"db88829","t3_5iha6f","5iha6f","science","scientific","Hey thanks for doing this AMA! This strikes really close to home for me, I live in north west Labrador above the 53rd parallel, very remote area, literally 700 miles in either direction to the next town.

We have a couple of unique features in my area and I'm hoping you can offer some advice.

We have a huge problem with dust. We're located in between two iron ore mines, two very large  ore productions within 2 miles of town.
Their tailings line's have piled up over the last 50 years so basically the entire outline of town is a giant sand pit 

Included a photo for reference. [You can clearly see tailings lines and their proximity to town.](http://imgur.com/FbWRwr4)

One of the mines closed a couple years ago leaving absoutely no upkeep for dust reduction.

And here comes problem number two, 
[the Forrest fire of 2013](http://imgur.com/kvyRyQb)

It's a bit hard to see but on that map but you can see the outline of the tailings sand pits from the previous photo and, in red,the amount of tree cover we lost to that one fire.

So, after spending the last 3 years choked to death with [dust](http://imgur.com/PcoQixp) in the summer time.

And being ""Conveniently"" located in between the two biggest CO2 producers east of Montreal, and with the upcoming changes in the carbon tax pricing

I've been looking at the viability of a Silviculture project to help with 
 
1) dust suppression
2) reforestation 
3) species diversification 
4) local area ascetics 
5) the creation of offset credits

So my questions are

What cold hardy species can be successfully introduced to a boreal forest area, dominated by coniferous trees to improve diversification? 

in regards to dust suppression, I'm assuming a root heavy shrub or bush, perhaps an alder bed might be more effective in retaining top soil material.
In the past they would just hydroseed grass on top, but that requires annual upkeep. Any species in mind that might have a good, fast growing(hopefully not super invasive), tight holding root system to use in between tress?

And honestly, I don't know very much about the creation of offset credits, any experience with this? 

And in regard to asethic, you can see the entire project area from my town, do you know of any diversification projects that had visual appeal for an area in mind during the creation process?  I'd love to look into them

Thanks agian for doing this AMA, look forward to your reply

My question silly at best. As water levels rise what will happen to the forests when there is bow a foot or so of sea water claiming the land. Take Florida for example, North Florida is about 25ft or so above sea level. Will trees just be sticking out of the flooded areas for X years until they die? If they survive (Assuming they are tall enough) will there just be weird tree top ecosystems, all refugees from the ground, sticking out above the waves.

I imagine in every craft there are blunders and setbacks so extreme they are marked in the respective calendars of that community. The kind of sobering events like a nuclear reactor meltdown adding to the stigma of nuclear power - that sort of thing.

"db3z27w","t3_5hwik7","5hwik7","science","scientific","Rob Jackson: Loss of methane and carbon dioxide from melting permafrost is a big concern in the future. Right now we don't see strong global evidence for increased methane emissions in the arctic (despite some evidence at particular sites). Northern latitudes are a pretty small player in the global budget, compared to warmer temperate and, especially, tropical systems.
     For people who want to dig into the papers, the ERL commentary (http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/12/120207) is freely available and has a nice graph of regional emissions attributed to different methane sources.","2016-12-12 19:45:02","9","Greenhouse-Gas","1747767238.483407","climate data","scientific"

> These opportunities include (i) venting and flaring of methane in coal-mines, while also improving worker safety, (ii) detecting and removing natural gas leaks, from wellpads upstream through the distribution chain downstream (e.g., McKain et al 2015), (iii) covering landfills, which reduces methane emissions while producing biogas for energy and transport usage, and (iv) developing farm bio-digesters, which has been extensively applied in Germany and is spreading to other European countries (e.g., Lebuhn et al 2014).

Of these, which would have the most significant impact on CH4 emissions? Which is the most likely to be implemented in the United States? Are these solutions also viable in developing countries?","2016-12-12 16:13:24","7","shiruken","1747767238.489558","climate data","scientific"
"db42uio","t3_5hwik7","5hwik7","science","scientific","Recently some of my friends (physicists) pointed out that absorption in CO2 band in atmosphere is already pretty much saturated. E.g. whatever CO2 can absorb it already absorbs and re-radiates. It means that more CO2 doesn't cause more global warming. Quoting them:

> Absorption of IR light is already saturated at given CO2 concentration and can't increase much more to create more greenhouse effect.
> We are looking on a graphs like one on the page 5 and 7 here, showing that CO2 is already absorbing max in it's bands

It's easy for us to say we need to reduce agricultural output, but that may mean removing a food source from people who need it in the developing world. We have to balance both an obligation to protect the planet (And it's people) in the long term with an obligation to protect people in the short term (starvation, weather, health, etc).
