"90qpd2","collapse","skeptical","760MM trees were planted in Pakistan. By my math, that reduces CO2 emissions by a whopping 0.05%","I saw a post in r/Futurology about the amazing ""Billion Tree Project"" in Pakistan, which got me to thinking: what impact does that many trees really have? Here's the hasty approximate math I did in a comment:

A young tree captures ~50lb of CO² a year (on the high end). That means all those trees capture about 16.5 million metric tons a year. Last year, we emitted just over 38 billion tons of CO².

Those 700 million trees only reduced our planetary emissions of carbon dioxide by about 0.05%.

Yes, planting trees is a good thing! But the perspective of how little an impact it makes in contrast to carbon-spewing coal plants is shocking.
