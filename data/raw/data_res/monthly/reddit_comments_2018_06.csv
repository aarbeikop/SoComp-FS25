This [Nature article from 2005](https://www.nature.com/news/2005/050531/full/news050531-10.html) explains how [serpentinization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4523005/)  (transformation of certain minerals such as olivine into methane via inorganic pathways) may explain the presence of atmospheric methane on Mars without any bacterial life. But the seasonal fluctuations in atmospheric methane are really interesting - what can explain them? The next step is actually looking for these methane-producing minerals on the surface of Mars. If we don't find enough of them... then the theory of ancient life on Mars becomes spine-tinglingly plausible!","2018-06-07 19:50:09","23","134_and_counting","1747794205.214148","climate data","scientific"

Webster, Christopher R., Mahaffy, Paul R., *et al.*, [Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1093), *Science* (June 8, 2018).

>**Abstract**

>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.

#####Second study:

Eigenbrode, Jennifer L., Summons, Roger E., *et al.*, [Organic matter preserved in 3-billion-year-old mudstones at Gale crater, Mars](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1096), *Science* (June 8, 2018).

>**Abstract**

>Establishing the presence and state of organic matter, including its possible biosignatures, in martian materials has been an elusive quest, despite limited reports of the existence of organic matter on Mars. We report the in situ detection of organic matter preserved in lacustrine mudstones at the base of the ~3.5-billion-year-old Murray formation at Pahrump Hills, Gale crater, by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite onboard the Curiosity rover. Diverse pyrolysis products, including thiophenic, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds released at high temperatures (500° to 820°C), were directly detected by evolved gas analysis. Thiophenes were also observed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Their presence suggests that sulfurization aided organic matter preservation. At least 50 nanomoles of organic carbon persists, probably as macromolecules containing 5% carbon as organic sulfur molecules.

When I was in school, panspermia was rejected out of hand as nearly impossible, as there is much more evidence for earthbound birth of life. But this...this right here can be one small piece of evidence that elevates the theory of panspermia just a bit. 

It’s still the more unlikely theory. By a **longshot**. Like, mountains of evidence for earthbound genesis. But hey, it makes the fun little theoretical a little more robust and fun.
