"b296i7","collapse","skeptical","Fact Check: ""More CO2 has been emitted since the UN established its climate body in 1992 to reduce emissions than in all of human history.""...TRUE","This statement is True. A [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1472-5) in 2015 emphasized the following fact:

>We then present empirical evidence for the role of specific fossil fuel corporations, including many of the 90 largest industrial carbon producers whose products are responsible for nearly two-thirds of all known industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1751 (Heede [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1472-5#CR27)). **We emphasize that more than half of all industrial emissions of carbon dioxide have occurred since 1988**: after the establishment of the IPCC, after leading scientists had stated publicly that anthropogenic climate change was underway, and after a vigorous and visible public discussion of its causes and risks had begun.

And the year before, the Union of Concerned Scientists talked about it...

>By the end of this year \[2014\], *more than half* of all industrial emissions of carbon dioxide since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution will have been released since 1988 — the year it became widely known that these emissions are warming the climate.  
>  
>I recently learned this startling fact from my colleague Richard Heede at the [Climate Accountability Institute](http://www.climateaccountability.org/). Heede drew upon historic estimates of annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing by the U.S. Department of Energy’s [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/) (CDIAC) and the 2014 annual update on the global carbon budget and trends published by the [Global Carbon Project](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/index.htm) (GCP), an international scientific research consortium studying the global carbon cycle.

Here is the Climate Accountability Institute from which that information was calculated:

>Since 1751 just over [400](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/graphics/global_cumulative.1751_2014.gif) billion metric tonnes of carbon have been released to the atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and cement production. Half of these fossil-fuel CO2 emissions have occurred since the late 1980s.

>[https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/tre\_glob\_2014.html](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/tre_glob_2014.html)

And more recently, the author David Wallace-Wells in his 2019 book **The Uninhabitable Earth: Life after Warming** writes...

>In fact, more than half of the carbon exhaled into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels has been emitted in just the last three decades.

If we add the roughly 200 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in just the last four years since that report by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, then the date continues to move forward marking when more than half of all CO2 emissions have occurred in human history. 1992 would be correct. More disturbingly, [CO2 emissions are actually increasing ***more than*** exponentially](http://blog.cityprojections.com/2018/06/is-atmospheric-co2-increasing.html).

By the way, we are [locked into at least 3.6C of global warming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5C4aAovWKE) no matter what and that figure increases as long as business-as-usual persists...
