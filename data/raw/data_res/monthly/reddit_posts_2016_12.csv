"5iha6f","science","scientific","Science AMA series: I'm Brian Buma, Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska. I study forest disturbances around the world, focusing on emerging mortality associated with climate change and carbon/water/forests as an integrated system. AMA!","Hi reddit!

I am a disturbance ecologist (think fires, windstorms, landslides) that primarily studies the response of forested ecosystems to emerging disturbances triggered by climate change.  I'm particularly interested in how resilient forests may be to these new stresses - and if that resilience is a good thing.  Will our forests recover from future disturbances?  What will that recovery look like?  Does this recovery – or lack thereof – help or hinder species ability to migrate in response to climate change?  What new disturbances are emerging?  

One striking example of all of these issues is the emerging mortality of species along the remote southeast Alaskan and Canadian west coast, where 400,000 ha (so far) of trees have died due to low snow conditions brought about by warming winters.  The cause is surprisingly related to freezing – the soil is no longer insulated by snow, so cold snaps can kill.  This is an emerging disturbance that we are just beginning to study, and it’s dramatically changing the forest community.  But it also appears to be associated with migration in other, less climate sensitive species.  So perhaps this disturbance, and others, are facilitating the migration of species into more favorable climates.  It’s a complex ecological story of adaption/maladaptation and creative destruction (so to speak), and great fun to investigate.

Most of my work involves a focus on either forest biodiversity, forest carbon, or water resources, and I've worked in Hawaii, the Rocky Mountains, and Alaska, and collaborated on projects around the world using a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing/satellites, GIS, and modeling.  I am also the caretaker of what is believed to be the longest running permanent study plots studying primary succession in the world in Glacier Bay, Alaska (100 years and counting).  So the data comes from a lot of sources, and I'm happy to discuss integration of methods as well.

**I will be answering  your questions at 1 PM  ET, AMA!**


Edit:  Thanks everyone!  Some really interesting and thought provoking questions in here, and it's humbling and exciting to see so many people concerned and interested in the state of the world's forests.  There were lots of great ideas for next steps, projects, etc mentioned here and I'd love to hear how those progress.

I have to run for a meeting but I'll check back in tonight (it's only 1PM in Alaska right now, after all, lots of time) and keep on doing what I can.   

Edit 2:  And I'm back for a bit.  This is really fun.  

...off for dinner.  Will log in later to reply further.  

In the meantime, most of my work is posted on my website, and for those great questions about coastal forests I would encourage you to check out the Alaska Coastal Rainforest Center (http://acrc.alaska.edu/) for all things coastal forest related.  Feel free to email with questions as well, I'm always looking for interested students and research collaborations, in addition to partners in management and policy.

Alrighty, it's late in Alaska, so I'm done (and Denzel is online...).  Thanks so much for your questions!

"5g34kf","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: We're researchers at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, who just published a pair of papers on buried ice deposits and potential volcano/ice and impact/ice interactions on Mars: ask us anything!","Hi!

We're Dr. Joe Levy and  Cassie Stuurman—we study geological systems in cold regions on Earth to try to understand the evolution of the surface of Mars and how cold landscapes on Earth record evidence of climate change.


Ice is one of the most important, but least appreciated geological materials. It flows and melts when local climate conditions are warm, and piles up when conditions are cold. You can drink it, measure the chemical fingerprint of past ice ages locked away in it, and even look for modern and ancient microbial life in it. So how do we use planetary analogs on Earth to understand surface processes on Mars? Where is the ice on Mars? How similar is it to glacial and permafrost landforms on Earth? What kind of changes to the surface of Mars and Earth have been wrought by changing climate over the last few million years? How are we going to use ice on Mars when humans begin to settle on that planet?


This is the paper Joe published - [Candidate volcanic and impact-induced ice depressions on Mars](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103516302093)

and this is the paper Cassie published - [SHARAD Detection and Characterization of Subsurface Water Ice 
Deposits in Utopia Planitia, Mars](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070138/full)


And here's the original Reddit post that made it to the front page - [A strangely shaped depression on Mars could be a new place to look for signs of life on the Red Planet, according to a study. The depression was probably formed by a volcano beneath a glacier and could have been a warm, chemical-rich environment well suited for microbial life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5clq6b/a_strangely_shaped_depression_on_mars_could_be_a/?st=iw2p5j3z&sh=a95d8428)

"5io7sh","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: Hi, we're editors and writers at Science Magazine, currently working on the Breakthrough of the Year issue. Ask us anything!","Hi reddit!
 
2016 was an amazing year for science, and much of the breakthrough research appeared in the pages (both physical and digital) of Science Magazine.  Now, we're working on a special end-of-year issue that will bestow upon one scientific achievement the title of ""Breakthrough of the Year.""
 
Every December, Science magazine announces a Breakthrough of the Year and a short list of runners-up. We, the writers and editors, comb through the year’s scientific advances--with help from the Board of Reviewing Editors and other scientists--and judge which have done the most to benefit humanity, answer long-standing questions, or pave the way for fruitful new research.
 
It’s a tricky task. Many discoveries take years to catch fire; others seem exciting but never fulfill their promise. And even when something big happens in science, it’s not always obvious exactly when and where the “breakthrough” took place. Here is our list of ""greatest hits.""
 
All that said, we also have [People's Choice award](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/vote-your-scientific-breakthrough-year), and this year, we wanted to come to Reddit to talk about the year in science and what you think might deserve the Breakthrough of the Year award.
 
Ask us anything!

"5hwik7","science","scientific","AAAS AMA: We're a team of researchers who have just published an assessment quantifying the global sources and losses of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and their role in contributing to a recent and surprisingly rapid increase in the atmosphere. Ask us anything!","Hi! We're Drs. Ben Poulter, Rob Jackson and Pep Canadell -- we study the global carbon cycle and try to balance budgets of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) by accounting for all known sources and losses, or sinks, from natural and human-related activities. Methane is a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 on a 100-year time horizon and has increased over 150% since the industrial revolution. Our budget is intended to answer questions such as: What are the sources of methane that are contributing to a renewed rate of growth that began in 2007 and where are they located? Has the rate of loss of methane decreased in the past decade? How has a switch in fossil fuel activities from coal-based to oil and gas extraction contributed to the increase in atmospheric methane? What is the role of agriculture (livestock and rice cultivation) versus wetlands in the growth rate of methane concentrations? And, what does the recent increase in methane concentrations tell us about projections used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?


A bit about our team:


Ben Poulter (http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/benjamin.poulter) is a Research Scientist in the Earth Sciences Division at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. He uses ecological models and remote sensing to understand the role of vegetation in the terrestrial carbon cycle and how humans and climate change have modified CO2 and CH4 fluxes.


Rob Jackson (https://earth.stanford.edu/rob-jackson) is the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor and Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment and at the Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University, and the Chair of the Global Carbon Project. Rob's lab seeks to produce the building blocks of basic scientific knowledge and to use that knowledge to guide policy solutions for global warming, energy extraction, and other environmental issues.


Pep Canadell (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/who_is_who/pep_canadell.htm) is the Executive Director for the Global Carbon Project and a Research Scientist at CSIRO in Australia. He focuses on collaborative and integrative research to study global and regional aspects of the carbon cycle, the size and vulnerability of earth carbon pools, and pathways to climate stabilization
