As you may know I'm a 60 y.o. uber-doomer, and I strongly agree with this article linked below. When the oligarchs tell us we got 12 years to do something about climate change, they're lying. We got 12 seconds. 

The world finally reached 100 million barrels of oil per day, a new record. After 20 years of trying to reduce emissions, we've only increased them 50%. Did McDonald's stock price collapse because of the IPCC special report? I guarantee you it did not. If McDonalds doesn't go out of business within a year, it's all over - and you know damn well they aren't going out of business in 12 years.

Claire Fyson says we got to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years to avoid 1.5 C. Vee Ramanathan says we'll hit 1.5 C by 2030. The IPCC used a different baseline to make it look like 1.5 C won't happen until 2040. They're doing this to buy time and put off action.

The permafrost and rainforests used to act like carbon banks, storing CO2, but now they're turning into carbon bombs, net emitters. The IPCC says if we give up meat and turn pasturelands into energy croplands we can beat this. They're full of fucking shit. We would need enough new cropland equal to the size of Australia, yet by 2030 we'll need 50% more food and 30% more water, while we're actually on course to have much less of each.

At last year's American Geophysical Union convention Stefan Rahmstorf told the audience that we must reduce emissions 100% in 20 years to avoid 2 C. Then Michael Man got up and said green energy will save us all. Then after he spoke, a women got up and started spouting off about women's rights. It was a fucking circus. My wife is a lifelong feminist, so am I, but Mann is a Clinton shill.

When I was 14 y.o., we were told not to trust anyone over 30. It's too bad millennials are hitting that age right about now.
