i dont give a shit who Mann shills for, I am interested in his work on climate.  Similarly Hayhoe is an evangelical christian, I ignore the cognitive dissonance necessary for her to believe in mysterious sky fairies while being a scientist and concentrate on her climate science but what I don't do is pay any attention to what they have to say on energy (here's looking at you James Hansen who can't do simple math in regards nuclear energy), politics, their favourite colour or what movie they like.

Aside from Kevin Anderson or Peter Kalmus, I don't know any climate scientiests who actually takes climate change seriously, they ALL suffer [implicatory denial](http://sydney.edu.au/environment-institute/blog/implicatory-denial-sociology-climate-inaction/).  There are maybe 6 people (perhaps there are more and are just silent) in here who take it seriously, the rest just complain endlessly and blame everyone but their own reflection while working to make it worse...

* Due to the impact of the Company's strategic refranchising initiative, consolidated revenues decreased 12% (14% in constant currencies)
* Systemwide sales increased 5% in constant currencies
* Consolidated operating income decreased 1% (4% in constant currencies), primarily due to $92 million of strategic restructuring charges ($85 million related to the previously disclosed restructuring charge for the U.S. business). Excluding these charges, as well as unrelated strategic charges in the prior year, consolidated operating income increased 2% (decreased 1% in constant currencies)
* Diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 12% (9% in constant currencies), reflecting $0.09 per share of strategic restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, diluted earnings per share was $1.99, an increase of 15% (12% in constant currencies) over prior year earnings per share (excluding $0.03 per share of prior year strategic charges)
