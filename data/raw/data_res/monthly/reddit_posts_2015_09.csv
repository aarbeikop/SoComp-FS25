"3loz1t","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: We are the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists, Ask us Anything about Polar Science!","**::edit:: Thank you all for your questions! It was such fun getting to talk to you and we look forward to answering more in the future! Remember to check out APECS' website (http://www.apecs.is/) and join for free if you're interested in getting into Polar science. You can also find contact information for some of the participants below and reach out to them individually.**

**::edit:: Keep those questions coming! The beauty of scientists in multiple time zones are that someone will likely be around to check. We'll continue answering through at least 11am (EDT) tomorrow when the next AMA begins. If you want to hear more about APECS' members research, you can also check out the #TweetYourThesis event on Twitter this Thursday (Sept., 24) starting at midnight GMT! Thank you so much for your interest in our Polar passion!**



​​The Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) is here to promote Polar Week! What is ​that​?​ ​There are two International Polar Weeks each year​ – ​one in March and one in September​ ​–​ ​which coincide with the equinoxes,​ the only time ​when everywhere on Earth has 12 hours of daylight. Polar Week is a time to celebrate how the​ beauty and diversity of the​ Polar Regions and the amazing research that happens there​!​ ​This AMA is just one of many events ​being held world-wide to connect and educate the public about all things polar. ​See a full calendar of events here: http://www.apecs.is/outreach/international-polar-week/upcoming-polar-week.html

​APECS ​is an international and interdisciplinary organization for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, early faculty members, educators​,​ and others with interests in ​Earth's ​Polar Regions ​(Antarctica and the Arctic) ​​as well as the wider cryosphere. ​Our goals include creating opportunities for the development of innovative, international, and interdisciplinary collaborations among current early career polar researchers as well as recruiting, retaining​,​ and promoting the next generation of polar enthusiasts.​ Learn more here: http://www.apecs.is​

APECS members participating in this AMA are early-career polar scientists in a variety of research areas with experience working in the polar regions in remote field locations and in some native communities, studying everything from sea-ice interactions to charismatic animals​ ​like​ ​penguins.​ ​We will be answering questions related to our research, what it’s like to work in the polar regions, or even how to get into polar research.

We will be here throughout the day to answer your questions, Ask us Anything!","2015-09-20 17:06:46","1183","217","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3loz1t/science_ama_series_we_are_the_association_of/","True","Polar_Scientists","1747747358.588534","climate data","scientific"
"3lajil","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I'm Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central who launched WXshift this week. Ask me anything about climate change, how it's affecting your weather!","Hi everyone, I'm the chief meteorologist for [WXshift](http://wxshift.com/) and Climate Central. I also run our National Science Foundation-funded program with that provides climate information to more than 250 on-air TV meteorologists. In previous lives, I was a meteorologist for Accuweather and on TV in Baltimore. I'm a proud Penn State alum (We are...!) and card-carrying weather geek.

I'm part of a team that just launched WXshift, a new weather site, this week. It offers something no other weather site has — relevant, localized trends in rainfall, snowfall, temperatures and drought in the context of your daily forecast. We couldn't be more excited about it and I would love to answer your questions about the site, how we crunched data from 2,000 weather stations, local (or global) climate change, weather or any other burning meteorology questions you have. 

I've brought along a few friends to join, too. Brian Kahn, a senior science writer here at Climate Central, Eric Holthaus, a writer at Slate and fellow meteorologist, and Deke Arndt, the head of climate monitoring at the National Centers for Environmental Information, are here to chat, too.

We'll be back at 2 pm ET (11 am PT, 6 pm UTC) to answer questions, ask us anything!

EDIT: Hey Reddit, [Bernadette](https://twitter.com/bernadettewoods) and [Brian](https://twitter.com/blkahn) here! It's 2 p.m. ET, and we're officially jumping in to answer your questions along with [Deke](https://twitter.com/dekearndt) and [Eric](https://twitter.com/ericholthaus). Look forward to chatting!

EDIT #2:
Hello everyone! Just wanted to send out a HUGE thank you to all of your for participating and for all of your questions. We are really sorry that we can't answer each and every one of them, but we tried to cover as much as we could today before signing out. Also, a BIG thanks to the other members of this AMA Deke and Eric. Until next time...
Bernadette and Brian
