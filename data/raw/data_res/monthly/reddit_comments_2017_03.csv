Q
An argument to fight global warming more often than not is to preserve our planet and the diversity of it. While I agree that all the data points towards an ever hotter planet, the same data shows that its been hotter in the past. So I ask if you agree with my assessment that greenhouse gas emissions take up a little bit too much space in the debate.

I mean, it's not global warming that kills off the Rhino, burn vast amounts of rainforest to grow crops, put plastic in our oceans, drain the aral lake, completely devastate the ocean floor while overfishing...... List goes on. 

Unless you have an interest in the field you seldom if ever hear about the above, and while it may seem that they are local problems. They really aren't. 

I just think that while an ever hotter planet is a bad thing(or rather, the rate of which it changes) and should be a concern, there are other imminent threats that happens without anyone knowing because co2 emissions are easier to measure and gets all the attention. The rate of which we as a human race kills off habitat for, and animals themselves is just off the charts.

"dfb3bx7","t3_611d2n","611d2n","science","scientific","Hi there -- thanks for doing the AMA, and let me preface my question with the statement that I'm fairly up to date about how rapidly the earth has started to warm in recent years, and because I live in the Canadian sub-arctic I have seen these changes first hand (and they're staggering). I'm also aware that humanity has basically gone ""over the cliff"", and we're now in between going over the edge and hitting the ground, leaving geo-engineering as the only viable way to avoid human extinction at this point.

Question 1: I know the spraying of sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere is commonly mentioned as an attainable way of deflecting solar radiation. However SO2 also breaks down ozone, which would make it unsuitable for sustained use. Are there any other compounds currently being considered? Compounds that could remain in the stratosphere for some time, and accomplish the same as SO2 or better?

Question 2: Are you aware of any serious (= large budget) programs currently concerned with artificial CO2 sequestration? I saw a calculation the other day of the energy required to draw all excess carbon out of the air and store it, and the number was just astronomical. Do you consider it likely humanity can start sequestering carbon on an industrial scale in the next 10 years?
