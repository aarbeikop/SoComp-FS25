From what I can tell, 20 years ago this area would have rated solidly in the 9a growing zone range.

My questions:

1. The last zone map was updated in 2012.  Is your work going to be considered by the USDA in order to update their hardiness zone map?
1. In what ways do you think this map will change in 10, 20, and 50 years?
1. Are farmers reacting to climate change by relocating their crops to more suitable zones?

I was just in Hong Kong less than a week ago, sure it is cold there! Anyways, speaking of disease control, we (I come from Singapore) have experienced disease outbreaks of large scale due to our shared hot and sometimes wet climate, like the SARS outbreak back in 2003.

Is there a possibility that culture plays a key role in disease transmission? Even in the modern world, we do keep traditions like sanitizing plates in Hong Kong at the table using hot water, when we drink we sometimes share a cup, etc, and hence are causing an unpredictable spread of diseases, which makes modeling even tougher?

Also, Hong Kong and Singapore do share a high population density, living in apartment buildings. Do you see trends of infection where one building gets mostly infected, then it starts spreading to other buildings, and modeling across the different stories that people live on?

One last question, infectious disease control is of utmost importance and urgency to nations. Seeing different countries' response to the Ebola outbreak, what can we learn in terms of hospital segmentation and pre-screening at borders? How does your model cope with these capture zones?

Thank you!","2016-03-23 13:01:15","8","SungMatt","1747756522.353154","climate data","scientific"
