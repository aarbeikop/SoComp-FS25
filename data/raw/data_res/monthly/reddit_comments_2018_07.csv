But the manufacturing of cars requires a large input of energy (hence CO2), and battery production is still relatively high CO2 process. 

They are certainly better and reduce CO2 emissions when compared to a standard gasoline car. 

But to maximize effectiveness, our whole energy grid needs to transition into solar, wind, nuclear first.

"e34cm51","t3_928naa","928naa","collapse","skeptical","Long term electric cars charged by wind and solar will obviously reduce emissions. Short term there are a lot of emissions involved in building them plus the infrastructure to support them so the question is how many years it takes to break even.

There are some interesting documentaries out there about how electric cars of the 19th and 20th century suffered and ultimately failed at the hands of the oil industry. They were common in the 1800s but after being supplanted by oil powered vehicles attempts to revisit the idea were often sabotaged. It feels like the same thing is happening now.","2018-07-27 09:20:57","7","Fredex8","1747716872.610413","CO2 emissions","scientific"

Select your state, click the ""Find Data"" button and look at the right chart. These numbers don't include the manufacturing of the car.

Furthermore, since this is not /r/environment:

Collapse inevitably leads to a permanent economic contraction (see Charles Hall's book ""Energy and the Wealth of Nations""), so people soon won't be able to afford driving, or won't have a work place to drive to. More immediately, the roads are already in a desolate state and the government isn't seriously planning to do anything about that. Especially most bridges are due or even overdue for a renovation (see [here](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/18/fewer-bridges-need-repairs-but-task-still-monumental/80512038/)) that the state budget can't afford. When a bridge is closed for being unsafe, a large portion of the road is becoming useless.

Forget about cars. They're not going to be around for much longer. The future brings us donkeys, carts, barges, and, in moderation, to cargo trains (see Alice Friedman's book ""When trucks stop running"").","2018-07-27 08:42:44","4","goocy","1747716872.616531","CO2 emissions","scientific"

So the only way to max out this potential using trees is to plant them, grow them as saplings, then harvest them while young and bury them deep underground while planting more. Without causing emissions with all that planting, cutting, and burying. Doing a similar thing with simpler plant life such as algae that has a faster life cycle would be better, but the same emissions restrictions apply, otherwise you're wasting energy and time canceling out the effort.","2018-07-21 17:07:37","20","Rhaedas","1747716873.906894","CO2 emissions","scientific"
