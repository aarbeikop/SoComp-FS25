However as you tire and the novelty wears off the tasks start to seem tedious and the isolation makes you question your performance as well as your stability.  

What is your team doing to keep motivated and cheerful in harsh conditions?

I found that something as simple as a BBQ sauce or seasoning could make bland repetitive food more interesting. Are you taking any special flavors on your trip?

Do you get much time to email and call home to friends and family?

The bitter cold of sub -40 weather combined with being stuck outside much longer then the work rest cycle allowed caused extreme discomfort, painful frostbite, and sickness. What does your team do to prepare for the worst possiblities such as vehicles breaking down and heaters failing? Do you have to fend for your selves in field maintenance or do you have support?

What is the biggest creature comfort that you wish you could bring but you can't?
