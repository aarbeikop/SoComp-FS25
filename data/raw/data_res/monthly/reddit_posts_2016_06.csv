We’re Drs. Jessica Hellmann and Tessa Hill and we are here to talk to you about improving how scientists can talk with the public about climate change. 

Climate scientists see firsthand the current and potential impacts of climate change, and often feel compelled to share these scenarios with the public and highlight the way their science intersects with critical societal interests. Yet, even the most capable science communicators can improve how they talk with non-scientists about crucial social and scientific issues in ways that both capture their complexity and move the dialogue forward.

The science of scicomm suggests it’s important to find common ground. There are promising practices developing within scicomm, and many scientists have had communication successes.  We’re here to help you improve your scicomm skills and share our stories from the field—Ask us anything!

This AMA is being facilitated as part of the [AAAS Leshner Leadership Institute](http://www.aaas.org/pes/leshner-leadership-institute), a fellowship program that helps foster scientists’ scicomm and public engagement skills.

[Jessica Hellmann](https://jessicajhellmann.wordpress.com/): I lead the [Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota](http://environment.umn.edu/).  I study global change and was among the first to propose and study new techniques for protecting ecosystems and people from climate change. 

[Tessa Hill](https://hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com/): I am at [UC Davis](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/)  and I study the impact of climate change on the ocean. I am experienced in science communication, including working with teachers and engaging stakeholders. I recently served on the West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Panel.

For background: [Sara K. Yeo’s 2015 paper, “Public Engagement with and Communication of Science in a Web-2.0 Media Environment”](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/content_files/public%20engagement%20social%20media_Yeo_single.pdf) is an excellent literature review of the scicomm field as it applies to social media.  Perhaps nowhere are the insights she collects more needed than when discussing climate change.

**We’ll be back at 1 pm EST (10 am PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask us anything!**

I’m Dr. Gerry Bell, a meteorologist in the Climate Prediction Center at NOAA’s National Weather Service, I lead teams of scientists at NOAA who predict the Atlantic, eastern Pacific and central Pacific hurricane seasons every year. Ask Me Anything!","Hello Reddit!


I’m Dr. Gerry Bell, a hurricane climate specialist and research meteorologist with NOAA's National Weather Service at the Climate Prediction Center. My research into the climate factors that control seasonal hurricane activity helped NOAA launch the first seasonal Atlantic hurricane outlook in 1998. Since then, I've been the lead scientist on the team that predicts Atlantic hurricane seasons and lead author of the annual hurricane outlook. I've spent a great deal of my professional career researching, publishing, and lecturing on the science of Atlantic hurricane activity, primarily the factors that fuel or hinder storm development. 


Each year, we monitor global climate patterns and use advanced computer models to predict how many named storms will form in the Atlantic, how many will become hurricanes (Category 1-2), and how many will become major hurricanes (Category 3-5). While our team can't predict how many hurricanes will make landfall, the seasonal outlook provides a general idea of whether the season will be slow or active based on climate patterns running in the background and influencing storm development. It also provides everyone in hurricane-prone areas with a great opportunity to get prepared.


On May 27, in fact, we issued our 2016 Atlantic hurricane season outlook. It calls for a near-normal season with a 70-percent likelihood of 10-16 named storms and 4-8 hurricanes, of which 1-4 could be major hurricanes. The announcement is available on NOAA.gov at http://www.noaa.gov/near-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season-most-likely-year.


I’ll be here from 1:00 pm EDT to 3:00 pm EDT today answering your questions about our predictions for this year and the science behind how we make those predictions … AMA!

Wow, two hours went by fast!  Thank you for your interest in science, and especially the science of seasonal hurricane forecasting. You asked some great questions, and I enjoyed this opportunity to connect with you and share information about my passion for hurricanes, climate, and hurricane season predictions. I have to put in a very important parting plug for preparedness ... 

Regardless of our outlook, it only takes one landfalling hurricane to devastate a community and change lives forever. Now is the time to get prepared for the 2016 hurricane season — do it before the storms threaten and stay safe this hurricane season. Below are some links to information I know you will find useful in preparing yourself and your family for the hurricane season. Until next time!
