> Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, is tired of the entire discussion, which he says comes down to definitions and academic bickering. There is no evidence for a change in the long-term warming trend, he says, and there are always a host of reasons why a short-term trend might diverge — and why the climate models might not capture that divergence.

> “A little bit of turf-protecting and self-promotion I think is the most parsimonious explanation,” Schmidt says. “Not that there's anything wrong with that.”

To what extent do you agree with Gavin? Is this discussion mostly an artifact of academic bickering? Is there room for nuanced discussion about the short term zigs in the warming data? Or do you think the issue has become too politicized?

Given all the studies that show warming, climate change, and accelerated man-made climate change, caused by increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, methane clathrate releases from Arctic seabeds and beneath frozen lakes, carbon loss from warming soils and permafrost, ocean acidification, deforestation, sea ice loss, accelerated Greenland and Antarctic glacier calving, global mountain glaciers in retreat, and all these numerous positive feedback loops that compound into an overall negative prognosis...

And given that we have 7.4 billion people on this plant with no intention of stopping, but are accelerating what we are doing: encompassing everything from having children, continuing to drive, eating meat, using plastics, generating wastes, eating industrially grown and harvested foods, etc.

Without any reductions in current exponentially continuing trends... What level of increase, in terms of average global temperatures, do you foresee in the next 20 years, the next 40, and by the end if this century? In other words, how on track are we to seeing wet bulb temperatures in places like parts of Saudi Arabia or India become incompatible with human and animal life for more than a few weeks at a time?
