You might think of Mars as Earth-like, but the South Pole of Mars is a strange and wonderful place unlike anything on Earth. During the winter, while the entire Martian South Pole is shrouded in complete darkness a a growing cap of carbon dioxide ice forms from the condensing atmosphere.  During the spring, carbon dioxide geysers from and loft dust and dirt through cracks in a thawing carbon dioxide ice sheet to the surface where it is believed that surface winds subsequently sculpt the material into dark fans observed from orbit. For nearly 10 years, the HiRISE camera (with 24.7 cm/pixel resolution) aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been imaging these seasonal processes. HiRISE is the highest resolution camera ever to sent to another planet. Hundreds of thousands of dark fans are visible in springtime HiRISE images. Automated computer routines have not been able to accurately identify and outline the individual fans in these images, but a human being intuitively can distinguish and outline these features.  Launched in January 2013, Planet Four (http://www.planetfour.org ) uses human pattern recognition to map the shape and direction of the fans visible in the HiRISE images in order to study the evolution of Mars' climate. Planet Four will also produce the largest areal coverage wind measurement of the Martian surface.

Many of  the surface features of Mars South Pole are sculpted by the never-ending cycle of freezing and thawing of exposed carbon dioxide ice and subsurface water ice. This features includes  'spiders' (radially organized channels carved in the surface), pitted sheets of carbon dioxide ice nicknamed Swiss Cheese Terrain, and channel networks carved by carbon dioxide gas trapped below the thawing ice sheet and also by the freezing and thawing of water ice permafrost. With Planet Four: Terrains (http://terrains.planetfour.org), we need your help to identify these different surfaces in images taken in orbit by the Context Camera (CTX). This is a task that is difficult for computers to do, but the human brain automatically identifies patterns. With your help, Planet Four:Terrains will find new and interesting regions of the Martian South Pole to study. Starting in July 2016 when sunlight returns to the South Pole, we'll point the HiRISE camera to monitor the evolution of these new targets of interest. The HiRISE observations will in the future be shown on the main Planet Four site to learn if there is fan and blotch formation and see how the process compares to other areas on the South Pole.

"3dwrac","sustainability","action-oriented","Conventional vs Organic Farming","I am a conventional farmer in Western Canada (growing wheat, canola, malt barley and oats), and am also a professional engineer (mechanical).  

A couple of months ago, I stumbled across one of my old engineering professor's Twitter accounts and saw him bashing conventional agriculture and promoting organic.  I put together some information for him to challenge his views and make him realize that the issues are not as ""cut and dried"" as he was making them out to be.  I have since shared it with a few other people, and have been encouraged to publish it online.

So, here it goes...


**A bit of background on me....**

I grew up on a family farm in Western Canada.  I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with my Bachelor's in 2008.  I had the top marks in my class, and received the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering.  I continued at the same university for two more years and completed a thesis-based Master's degree. 

Upon graduating, I worked for a small bio-energy firm  for three years and earned my P.Eng.  After finishing my P.Eng, I made the decision to leave my full time job so I could be more involved with the farm (while I enjoy engineering, the farm has always been my passion).  I continue to practice as an engineer during off-peak times on the farm with a small company that specializes in doing energy audits.

Together with my brother (who has a BSc in Agriculture (Crop Sciences)), my dad, and one full-time employee, we farm approximately 5,250 acres of farmland (roughly 8.2 square miles, or 21.2 square kilometers).  We generally grow wheat, canola, oats and malt barley, all for human consumption (not animal feed).  In a typical year, our farm produces around 8,000 Metric Tonnes of grain (imagine how many people that feeds!).

We employ a wide variety of advanced farming techniques, including zero-tillage farming, GPS auto-steer and sectional control (to avoid over-application of fertilizer and pesticides), GPS yield mapping, variable rate fertilizer applications (to target fertilizer to the areas of the field with high yield potential), and are even experimenting with the use of UAV drones for data collection.

I'm not sure what your views/experience with agriculture are, but I thought I would share some of my views on various topics that seem to come up from individuals that have concerns with modern agriculture.

**Sustainability**

One point that I often see raised is sustainability - many people feel that organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming.  A couple points I would like to raise on this:

- Does yield factor into your definition of sustainability?  Yields in conventional agriculture are significantly higher than yields in organic farming. A meta-analysis of organic and conventional farming found that yields from organic agriculture are often as much as 34% lower than from conventional agriculture. (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature11069.html?message-global=remove)

When less food is produced from each acre of land, then more land must be brought into production.  The bio-fuels industry received a lot of criticism for causing deforestation of the Brazilian rainforests because so much corn was being used to make ethanol.  Organic farming (which produces less per acre, thus requiring more land) is just as responsible for this.

- Another factor that is often overlooked is nutrients.  One of the biggest environmental impacts of conventional agriculture is the large amounts of energy required to produce synthetic fertilizers.  However, organic farmers are reliant on conventional farmers in this area...

Determining how much fertilizer is required for a crop is a fairly simple mass balance.  The grain we harvest each year contains nutrients.  Thus, each year we must apply enough fertilizer to offset the nutrients we are removing in the grain.  We monitor this over time by having soil from each of our fields tested by a lab every year to ensure that nutrient levels are being maintained.

Organic farmers face this same challenge.  However, organic farming does not allow for the use of synthetic fertilizer.  While crop rotations can be used to satisfy some of their nutrient requirements (crops like peas and beans have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in their roots and take nitrogen from the air and make it available to the plant - and note, conventional farmers utilize this too!), they often apply manure as fertilizer.  That manure is often from animals that have been eating conventional grain (so the nutrients in the manure are from synthetic fertilizer).  A study done in [France](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044045/article) found that 23% of the Nitrogen, 73% of the Phosphorous, and 53% of the Potassium nutrients (the 3 main macro-nutrients) used in organic farming were from synthetic fertilizer.  So in reality, the only difference is that the nutrients that organic farmers use have gone through the digestive tract of a cow ;)

- The last sustainability topic that I want to bring up is tillage.  Over the past 20 years, nearly every acre of grain farmland in Western Canada has been converted to zero-tillage farming.  Each spring, the new crop is seeded directly into the stubble from the previous year's crop with the smallest amount of soil disturbance possible.  This practice has drastically reduced soil erosion, it helps conserve moisture, and it sequesters carbon in the soil (in fact, farmers who adopt this practice in Alberta generate Carbon Offset credits).

I grew up in the 80's, when tillage was still the norm.  To seed our crops, we used to have to make anywhere from 3 to 8 passes over our fields.  The result was soil that was completely pulverized, bone dry, and susceptible to wind erosion.

Nearly all the fence lines in Western Canada have dirt ""drifts"" along them, from soil erosion.  My parents have pictures of me and my sister playing outside when we were young on black snow, since wind had blown soil from nearby fields into our yard.  After a windy day, rural counties used to have to send crews out to dig the soil of of the ditches along the county roads and dump it back on the farmer's fields.

Why do I bring this up?  Organic farmers are utilizing tillage to control weeds.  Still sound more sustainable than conventional farming?

**Pesticides**

Another point that I often see raised is pesticides - here are some thoughts on that...

- First of all, organic farmers use them too.  While they are not allowed to use synthetic pesticides, they are allowed to use naturally occurring ones.  However, as I'm sure you realize, not everything found in nature is ""safe"" or ""less toxic"" than synthetically made things.  Many of the ""natural"" pesticides used in organic farming are more toxic than the synthetic ones used in conventional farming.

[Here](https://twitter.com/DavidKucher/status/602649450310275073/photo/1) is a list of pesticides allowed in organic farming. 

- Newer, safer pesticides are constantly being developed.  Of the three classes of pesticides (herbicides, which control weeds; fungicides, which control plant diseases; and insecticides, which control insects), insecticides are the most dangerous.  We are fortunate in Western Canada that our cold climate does a good job of controlling insects, so we very rarely have to use them.  However, sometimes insect infestations happen and they do need to be used.

One of the major downsides of using an insecticide is that they are non-selective, meaning that they kill ALL insects in the fields (including beneficial insects that feed on the pest insects, and pollinators like bees).  As a result, farmers take the decision to use an insecticide very seriously!

Dupont has recently developed a new insecticide called [Coragen](http://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-67_Coragen_Tech_Bulletin_Canola_E.pdf) which helps address this issue.  Rather than killing insects on contact by attacking their nervous system, the insecticide coats the plants.  When insects eat the plant, the chemical paralyzes their jaws, causing them to starve.  The insecticide has no impact on bees and other beneficial insects.

Rather than being able to embrace new products like this, organic farmers will have to continue using the highly toxic ""natural"" insecticides that they are permitted to use (such as pyrethrin - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin)

- Using the least amount of pesticides possible is the goal of all farmers - they are very expensive! (and we are the ones exposed to them in their most concentrated form - using less of them reduces our exposure to them).

All farmers (conventional and organic) practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Throughout the year, a wide variety of measures are taken to control pests, with pesticides being only one of them.

Some examples of IPM would include: establishing a healthy plant stand (through proper seeding rates) to enable the plants to out-compete pests, selecting varieties that are resistant to pests (and rotating varieties, to ensure that resistance does not break down), utilizing crop rotations (certain pests target certain crops), and eliminating areas where insects/weeds live/breed (ex: mowing weeds in ditches/abandoned yardsites to prevent them from going to seed). When a pesticide is used, the field is first scouted to verify that it is in fact necessary, the pesticide is applied at the correct rate and at the correct time, and the pesticides used are rotated from year to year to avoid developing resistance).

**GMO's**

Another topic that draws a lot of attention is genetically modified crops (such as in the March Against Monsanto this past weekend).  A few points on them...

- The scientific consensus is that GMO's are safe.  The Pew Research Center polled the membership of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and found that 88% of scientists feel it is safe to eat genetically modified food (which is greater than the 87% consensus that humans are causing climate change).  In contrast, only 37% of the general public feels that GMO's are safe.  This is the largest gap in opinion between scientists and the general public.

- There is more to GMO's than Monsanto.  For example, GMO's saved the Hawaiian papaya industry by developing a variety that was resistant to a disease that nearly wiped out that industry; GMO's are being used to develop orange trees that are resistant to a disease that is threatening the Florida orange industry; GMO's have been used to develop bio-fortified crops, such as Golden Rice; etc.

- GMO's are helping farmers to reduce the use of pesticides.  Bt crops have cut down on the amount of insecticides by making the crops naturally resistant to insect attacks.  Round-up Ready crops (resistant to the herbicide glyphosate) have increased the use of glyphosate; however, glyphosate is less toxic than the herbicides that it has replaced (ie: the herbicides used to control weeds in non-GMO crops).

On our own farm, we grow GMO canola.  The other crops we grow (wheat, oats, and malt barley) are all non-GMO (no GMO varieties are registered for use).  In the past 20 years, our canola yields have doubled (from approximately 25 bushels/acre to 50 bushels per acre), while the amount of herbicides (and their toxicity) we use have decreased.

Yields of our other (non-GMO) crops have increased too, but at a much, much slower rate (in the same period of time, wheat yields would have gone from around 50 bushels/acre to 60 bushels/acre, a 20% increase).

**Monsanto**

A lot of the public's disdain for modern agriculture is directed at Monsanto.  Here are some points on that...

- Growing GMO crops requires farmers to enter into a contract with the company that developed the seed (Monsanto, Bayer, etc - Monsanto is not the only company that makes GMO's).  Farmers are free to choose whether or not to do this (if they don't want to, they can grow non-GMO crops).  However, many farmers do choose to grow them, because the increased yields and other benefits they offer outweigh the additional costs.

One of the terms of the contract is that the farmers must purchase new seed every year.  Farmers often do this regardless of whether they are growing GMO or non-patented non-GMO crops.  Crops bred through hybridization (corn, canola, etc) only exhibit the increased plant vigor they offer for one generation, so new seed must be used each year.  For crops that don't use hybrid breeding (wheat, oats, barley, etc), breeders are constantly releasing new varieties with improved traits (higher yields, disease resistance, etc), so farmers often purchase new seed regularly to take advantage of this.

- Monsanto has never sued farmers for accidental contamination of their crops. (http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx).  

They do sue farmers who breach their contract with Monsanto and save seed and replant it without paying royalties - rightly so though! Monsanto spends roughly $1 billion per year on research and development - they need to make a return on that investment.  In addition to that, if they were to allow some farmers to break the rules and not pay royalties, then it puts the farmers who do play by the rules at a disadvantage (since they have higher costs than their neighbors who are not paying the royalty).

- Monsanto is primarily a seed business, not a pesticide manufacturer.  Round-Up (glyphosate) is the only pesticide they manufacture, and it has been off-patent for a number of years.  The majority of the glyphosate used is ""generic"" (ie: made by other companies).

- Organic food is big business too.  Whole Foods (an organic supermarket chain) has yearly sales that are approximately equal to Monsanto's.

**General Comments**

A few random comments...

- ""Corporate"" farms are not big, ""evil"" companies.  My family's farm is a ""corporate"" farm (ie: it is ""incorporated"").  Many family farms do this for tax purposes.  Our farming business pays each of use a wage to live on, and the rest of the farm's profits stay in the farm and are re-invested (in land, machinery, etc).

- Like all things in life, agriculture involves ""balancing"" many competing objectives/goals. Farming requires balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population (with less labor, since trends are towards increased urbanization) at a reasonable cost (even in ""first world"" countries like Canada there are people who cannot afford to eat proper meals!).

- To me, it is important for farmers to produce food  in the most efficient way possible.  If someone is a small market gardener on the outskirts a city, and they have enough labor to grow everything ""organically"" and feel that those practices make them most efficient, then great! They should absolutely do that! However, suggesting that ALL farming should be organic, when nothing suggests that this is even possible, is a terrible attitude (and one that is only possible for very privileged, first-world urbanites).

- While some ""organic"" farming practices do have merit (as I discussed, there are lots that conventional farmers use too!), organic farming as a whole is too much about conforming to an arbitrary set of ""rules"", rather than doing what is best/most efficient.  Technology is going to continue to develop, and organic farmers are not going to be able to embrace many new things coming down the pipeline (GMO crops bred to be more nutrient/water efficient, insecticides like the one I mentioned that only target pest insects, etc).

- Technology has improved every aspect of our lives - why wouldn't we apply it to farming?  I often wonder if when the ""pro-organic"" people go to the doctor's office if they ask to be treated using technology from 70 years ago?  If not, then why do they do that when they buy food???

- Lastly, I'm going to share a TED talk on agriculture with you.  It was done by an agrologist from Alberta.  I feel it does an excellent job articulating the challenges affecting modern agriculture.  Of all the links I have shared in this email, this is the one I would most encourage you to check out :)
