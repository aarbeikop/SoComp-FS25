As time has gone on more people have come over to our side and in the future, as things get progressively worse, the inevitability of the situation will dawn on even more minds.

There was never a chance, from the moment the utility of fossil fuels were discovered, that humanity wasn't going to burn every last bit we can get our hands on. ","2017-12-17 14:06:17","41","TheRetsoper","1747711988.4626381","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"drdka3y","t3_7kcznk","7kcznk","collapse","skeptical","'Twas all prophesied, dontcha know! Here's a little cultural artifact that pretty much sums up the inevitable nihilism that comes with a dawning awareness that we are all essentially livestock now.

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me","2017-12-17 14:51:05","16","lucidcurmudgeon","1747711988.467346","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"drdkzq6","t3_7kcznk","7kcznk","collapse","skeptical","We have about 8 years of carbon budget left under the high temperature trajectory models before we pass the 2C cumulative emissions thresh hold. So, when you consider what needs to be done on a global and systems level, and consider that Trump will be President for 3 and quite possibly 7 of those years, yeah, the fight on the emissions front is pretty much over.

And even if some reliable, economical, practical carbon capture technology emerges (which is possible), it seems increasingly implausible that it could be scaled up fast enough.   

I expect that over the next decade you are going to see more and more pressure behind proposals to geo-engineer. It is the last emergency lever at this point.","2017-12-17 15:09:44","10","AgingDisgracefully2","1747711988.4837172","CO2 emissions","scientific"

"drelzdp","t3_7kcznk","7kcznk","collapse","skeptical","This is why I occasionally voice support for the benefit of a world-wide nuclear war. An event like that would halt all activity, and assuming the knowledge we have accumulated and some means of (clean) production still remained, survivors could potentially carry on, taking the lessons of our gluttonous, reckless expansion with them. The situation is properly fucked, and with severity of illness, severity of remedies comes to the fore. Inevitably, there are those who say such talk is abhorrent or defeatist, but it's really simple, what other answers do we have to the question of ""How to eliminate carbon emissions and resource extraction immediately?""

Cease production immediately, and simultaneously reduce the need for that production which was in place to begin with. It's extreme, but where has all that optimism and indolence taken us?","2017-12-18 02:54:31","5","sgt_mjr_stretchnuts","1747711988.4875689","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"drdikmk","t3_7kcznk","7kcznk","collapse","skeptical","Eventually gas powered cars will be rare. But yeah, numbers will get far worse until that happens. Some states, like California, are requiring that a percentage of new fleet vehicles be hybrid, electric, or low emission by a certain date. Like 30% of vehicles by 2030, for example (just an estimate). ","2017-12-17 14:01:07","3","[deleted]","1747711988.4894989","CO2 emissions","scientific"
