"e58h7u3","t3_9c3fhs","9c3fhs","climatechange","action-oriented","IPCC is a good place to start. Just remember that the scientific approach is conservative regarding any topic, and rigorous peer review can sometimes add to this, esp regarding a large body of scientists who know they are publishing work that will underpin policy at a global level and therefore must be palatable. My personal favourite was when the IPCC omitted methane from their model and subsequent recommendations citing that to include it would, ""be too horrifying to contemplate."" Things are in such a state of flux that by the time studies are done, reviewed and published, the situation may have progressed significantly.

There are literally thousands of studies on climate change authored by many thousands more scientists and all that information is summarized in the IPCC reports by about a thousand authors from institutions all over the world. You will never find more complete or comprehensive resource on the matter. ","2018-09-01 22:35:58","2","Kalapuya","1747797316.060544","climate data","scientific"

Consequently, the data “is consisent with” anything you want it to be.  There’s no real basis for rational discussion.  Alarmism rules because it gets press and funding and is not punished - incorrect predictions just result in more funding to figure out how they could have been so wrong.","2018-09-01 15:33:09","-10","technologyisnatural","1747797316.062779","climate data","scientific"
