I'm going to guess if you planted enough trees to offset 100% of the US carbon budget in a year you'd also get a lot off follow on benefits that avalanche, in a good way.

Ignoring those and taking the number provided at face value, it would cost about $15B to offset emissions for the entire year. Or, to put it another way that's less than 0.1% of the US GDP in 2018. Or, $46 per person per year. 

- The government has spent about $68B on the F22 program. 

- Wikipedia estimates the Trump border wall to cost $21.6B.

- The 1.8 mile long Second Ave subway in New York City is projected to cost $4.5B.

- The US Air Force in 2017 purchased $4.9B worth of fuel alone.

- New York City has a $10B plan to protect Manhattan from sea level rise.

Trees also sequester carbon as they grow, which offsets the carbon dioxide produced in manufacturing them into paper products, and paper biodegrades very quickly.
