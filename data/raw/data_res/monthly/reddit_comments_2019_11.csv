I like the carbon footprint stamp idea on food products and wholeheartedly support the campaign. Hope this becomes an international standard for all food products.","2019-11-08 12:33:57","20","[deleted]","1747826648.9944692","climate data","scientific"

"f7bnjt9","t3_dteann","dteann","sustainability","action-oriented","Hi everybody! Thanks for all the help, we’ve made it to 40 000 signatures with only a few hours left. That’s incredible! And a lot of it comes from this group (we think). Is there anybody who knows any influencers that you can influence to tell people to sign the petition in that influencing way that only they can? It would be so cool to make it all the way to 50 000, very few petitions do. Anyway, just wanted to thank you all for the help and the discussions. Looking forward to more talks in the future, maybe an AMA or something. Peace oat!

Edit: We made it! Thanks and love y'all!","2019-11-12 15:42:51","1","OAT-LY","1747826649.011631","climate data","scientific"
