"dkqp0cf","t3_6pnkvf","6pnkvf","science","scientific","Hi Ralph and Jenifer, and thank you for doing this AMA.

I think the topic of evidence-based standards of care for transgender youth is incredibly interesting. I imagine in some ways it has been a challenge for the field to even begin to address this question since there has historically (and even today) been so much taboo surrounding the topic.

I was hoping you could give a historical overview of how the community has thought about providing care to transgender youths and how this has evolved over time. It would be especially interesting if you could point to some key findings that motivated changes in the field (for example studies that invalidated antidepressants for gender dysphoria or studies that demonstrated utility of puberty blockers).

**Sex:** The classification of a person as male or female. At birth, infants are assigned a sex, usually based on the appearance of their external anatomy. (This is what is written on the birth certificate.) A person's sex, however, is actually a combination of bodily characteristics including: chromosomes, hormones, internal and external reproductive organs, and secondary sex characteristics.

**Gender Identity:** A person's internal, deeply held sense of their gender. For transgender people, their own internal gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. Most people have a gender identity of man or woman (or boy or girl). For some people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into one of those two choices (see non-binary and/or genderqueer.) Unlike gender expression (see below) gender identity is not visible to others.

**Transgender: (adj.)** An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. People under the transgender umbrella may describe themselves using one or more of a wide variety of terms - including *transgender*. Many transgender people are prescribed hormones by their doctors to bring their bodies into alignment with their gender identity. Some undergo surgery as well. But not all transgender people can or will take those steps, and a transgender identity is not dependent upon physical appearance or medical procedures.

**Gender Dysphoria:** A mental health disorder which is characterized by transgender people feeling significant distress or functional impairment in one or more areas of their life. Not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and those who do do not experience necessarily experience GD permanently. Transitioning tends to reduce dyspohria

**Gender Identity Disorder:** an outdated mental health disorder that was removed from the DSM when the most recent version, the DSM 5, was published.

"dkqua0b","t3_6pnkvf","6pnkvf","science","scientific","Hi! I'm at a UK university and am on the committee of one of the men's sports societies. This year we became the first sports society in our university to have a transgender student as part of our society. The person in question was a woman at birth but now identifies as a man, but is pre-op and is not having any treatment as of yet.

As a consequence our student union has put a lot of pressure on us to be as accommodating as possible - however some of the things they have required us to do actually make the student in question more excluded than included - things like 'if this student complains we'll shut you down' have led to roughly half of committee meeting time focusing around this student.

However the main difficulty for us and the student is the understandable requirement of separate changing rooms before matches, and quite a bit of socialising within the specific team occurs whilst people are getting ready for the match, which this student cannot easily be part of.

What would you suggest we do as a society to ensure this student is included more? None of us on committee have ever had a transgender person as a friend or teammate before so we're all a bit clueless and the union are frankly unhelpful as their advice only extended as far as 'don't mess this up' rather than 'here's what you can do to make this better for them'.
