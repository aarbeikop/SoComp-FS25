"6cndk8","climate","scientific","""Over the course of the 20th century, the solar magnetic field doubled"" . Can you help me find data in my discussion with a climate denier?","I'm having a back-and-forth discussion with a climate denier. He asked me to watch this movie and I'm watching it, and I'm finding most of it is just bogus. the gist of the movie is that climate change is a result of solar influence and has nothing to do with CO2.

at exactly 33:10. They discuss how Earth temperatures correlate perfectly with solar variations. . They also make the claim that ""over the course of the 20th century, the solar magnetic field double""

first off, I can find no verification one way or another the solar magnetic field doubled over the 20th century.

Secondly, can anybody verify that chart They show at 33:15? Is it made up? Is it accurate?

thank you for any help

"69722h","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I’m Dr. Jeff Brawn, a University of Illinois ornithologist and conservation biologist. You may experience a heightened awareness of birds during these early weeks of spring—particularly at 4 a.m. when neighborhood chirping seems ridiculously loud. I study birds year round! AMA!","Hi reddit!

I’ve been fascinated by birds ever since taking a class in ornithology as an undergraduate. Now, as a professor and researcher at U of I, a lot of what I do is about bird populations and how they ""tick"" and how to conserve them. For example, in one project we tracked the role of robins in the spread of West Nile virus    (http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vbz.2007.0123). Although the primary culprit in spreading the virus is the common mosquito, robins are accomplices. They’re what we call ""super-amplifiers"" of the disease. Crows and jays just can't handle West Nile virus and they die when they get it, but robins do much better. They are a competent host of the disease. And, because robins are common in urban environments, they might be part of the smoking gun for why and where the disease is and isn't.
 
Since 1986, I’ve been involved in a project with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute studying bird populations in Panama’s Soberania National Park—approximately 100 square miles of protected rainforest. It’s also home to well over 500 bird species. Because we have over 30 years of data, we were able to study the effect of changing environmental conditions and its relationship to bird populations.
 
Because the tropics are relatively stable with milder seasonal change, tropical birds may not be able to handle environmental disturbances as easily, physiologically or behaviorally, as temperate-zone birds. Those Midwest birds who wake us up while it’s still dark are able to make it through below-zero winters and 100-degree summers—environmental stress that tropical birds never experience. Consequently, tropical ecosystems and animal populations may be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
 
Here’s a link to the full paper about the research that appeared in Nature Climate Change:

This article, Will climate change leave tropical birds hung out to dry?  includes a short video of me talking about why I think this research is so important.
