"cv82suv","t3_3loz1t","3loz1t","science","scientific","Someone asked about polar bears and then deleted their comment, but here's info anyways:

I'm not sure we have any bear experts today, so I'll try to answer as best as I can. While you might see other bears above the Arctic Circle, Polar bears (*Ursus maritimus*) are the species most known for living in this region. Specifically, you can find them in Alaska (USA), Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Svalbard (Norway). Contrary to popular belief, they do not live in Antarctica. :)

They like to live in areas with good annual sea ice extent and near the seals they eat. Given their behavior within the environment, they're considered marine mammals (the same classification for dolphins, for example). They're quite big, with males around 1,000 lbs (~450kg) and you should have a healthy respect for them given their impressive predation!

Polar bears are definitely being affected by climate change as they rely on sea ice extent to hunt. You can learn more about this here (including basics on global climate change): http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/about-polar-bears/climate-change

Polar Bears International is also a great resource for everything about these amazing animals: http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/about-polar-bears

A fun note, scientists believe that Polar Bears may have evolved from Grizzlies: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/arctic-bears-how-grizzlies-evolved-into-polar-bears/777/

If anyone is an educator, here's a great resource to teach students about Polar Bears: https://www.nwf.org/pdf/NWF-Movies/Polar_Bear_Artic_Ed_Guide.pdf

How can we expect these extremes to continue to develop over say the next lifetime or 50 years?

Do you think what is happening is Earth's natural cycles (ie. heating and cooling) and we are just speeding up the rate at which they occur or is something else at play?

Based on what you know now, what will be some of the first major changes due to our shifting climate that will affect our lifestyles?","2015-09-17 12:42:42","9","jbuckfuck","1747747379.21684","climate data","scientific"

""They are saying that that small amount of warming will trigger a further warming, through the effect mainly of water vapor and clouds. In other words, if you warm up the earth by 1 degree, you will get more water vapor in the atmosphere, and that water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas and will cause you to treble the amount of warming you are getting.""...""The clouds are making sure that warming isn't very fast. And they're certainly not exaggerating or amplifying it. So there's very, very weak science to support that assumption of a trebling""
