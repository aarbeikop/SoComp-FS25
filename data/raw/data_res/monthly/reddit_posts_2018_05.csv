"8gkfbx","climatechange","action-oriented","Hi! I need help getting data to show projections of the trends of climate change in the future affected by our active solutions","Hello everyone! I'm currently doing an academic essay, writing for an argument that solutions to climate change matters and can possibly reverse its trend. To do that, I need sources to show that in the future, with sufficient effort put into these solution, we could potentially reverse the effect of climate change be it warming or CO2 concentration, by showing projections of the existing data, how it could be decreased, and how long it would take to effectively 'reverse' it. Alternatively, I could also use any data that oppose this, so you are welcomed to disproof me!


Feel free also to discuss about this topic, I personally think it's quite something to ponder about! (thus the essay selection)

I'm relatively new to academic essay writing, thus not being any proficient in doing source searching, any tips on getting data or spotting bias would also be much appreciated!
