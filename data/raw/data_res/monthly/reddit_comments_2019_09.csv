One technique I have found to be very helpful in changing their minds is by first recognizing that vaccines are not ""perfect"" and there are some legitimate concerns associated with them. For example, allergies or other adverse immunological reactions. I find this is a great way to disarm people and show that you are not self-righteous and willing to listen to them. 

My question is: are there equivalents with climate change science? Are there perhaps certain areas of the science behind climate change that are potentially overblown?

I sometimes like to go on the NOAA site on occasion to look at interesting statistics and trends for fun sometimes.

This September has been _exceptionally_ wet for the US.  Particularly in the Midwest, where I'm at, it's causing quite a few problems for farmers who would have, in the past, normally have liked to be harvesting around now.  These farmers got into the fields late this year on account of excessive flooding and wet fields that were not ready for planting.  A lot of fields had standing water in them.  Now that it is harvest season, farmers are running into the same problem they did last year.  Last September we in our area, had 4 times our normal precipitation rate.  This year, throughout the US in September while the monthly totals aren't in yet, the largest daily accumulations of rainfalls for September are insane again.  

https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/records

My question is: I know weather doesn't directly represent climate, are the wetter springs and falls going to be more normal in the future in the midwest (along with drier in the west)?  What sorts of weather changes are predicted in the US expect in the next 15-20 years if current trends continue?  In the next 50 years, and in the next 100 years?

Also, I read somewhere that emissions are likely to offset the next iceage, which would have come in around 1500 years, could you talk some about that?","2019-09-20 14:39:12","9","Let_you_down","1747823242.499804","climate data","scientific"

I think my question is best suited to Dr. Dukes or Dr. Cloyd, what are your thoughts on the 'micro vs macro' drivers of climate change? 

Specifically, in my understanding, if a relatively small area, such as that surrounding a human settlement or industry, has substantial change in vegetation/albedo/local emissions this area is far more likely to experience effects which are likely to be ascribed to 'climate change'. This is accurate in that the climate has changed but innaccurate in that the reduction of global atmospheric carbon is not going to help the degraded local environment and as such is not likely to reduce the immediate impacts of climate change that these areas are experiencing.

Are you aware of any studies quantifying the 'micro' effect at a local level and how it contributes to the 'macro' or global effect?","2019-09-20 13:37:40","6","Dragoarms","1747823242.5062459","climate data","scientific"
"f0vo2ht","t3_d6uez5","d6uez5","science","scientific","An article caught my attention yesterday because Cory Booker advocated for nuclear power in addition to expanding renewables. The article contained some interesting information regarding how significant nuclear power is in aiding our transition away from fossil fuels that I had never seen before. Here is a summary:

-	in order for renewables to replace coal and natural gas plants by 2050 renewables must grow an average of 2% per year (currently they average 0.6%, according to the article)
-	if we simultaneously increase the number of electric vehicles on the roads to replace ICE vehicles we would need to double total capacity which would require a growth in renewable energy more than 7 times the current rate (presumably the article means replacing all ICEs, but it does not specify)
-	if we phase out nuclear plants by 2035 this increases the required growth rate of renewables to 17x current rates
-	if we decommissioned nuclear plants immediately the growth rate for renewables becomes 25x current rates

I didn’t see any source for these specific statistics. Does this information seem accurate? Where do you see nuclear power fitting in while we transition away from coal and natural gas? 

Based on the article we are nowhere close to the required growth rate for renewable energy to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050, how do we start to close that gap and make up for the deficit? What do you think is the primary reason we have not achieved the rate required?
