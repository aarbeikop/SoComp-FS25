I'd kill for the sources on these.

Btw Will Steffen says that we have 20 years max to make our carbon emissions reach 0 in order to have a 66% chance of avoiding 2.0°C; that above this there are feedback loops which we cannot control and may put us up to 7°C+ regardless of what we do.

Also note that he says we have 20 years as of right now and that if we overshoot and decarbonize in, say, 21 years it's going to be too late.","2019-09-19 14:43:44","96","RedditLovesAltRight","1747729186.6665878","CO2 emissions","scientific"

I think it would be wrong to assume such a massive shift may accompany such a change. However, reproductive systems in animals don’t change without reason. I know that correlation does not equal causation, but it is interesting as a human to see the growth in LGBTQ populations of people. 

Sure, those folks have always existed, but what we don’t have a good handle on is how and why such phenomena may change over time. We live in an overpopulated, polluted world with very little chance for children in the vast majority of situations, to have a good life these days. 

As a result, it is in no way surprising to me then that human sexuality (not being static like any other primates) would respond to a change in conditions such as this. 

For the first time in a very long time of not ever, reproducing and ensuring the survival of one’s genes really doesn’t confer any sort of advantages. Furthermore, nearly all of those within a decent reproductive age range are at least subconsciously terrified at the idea of having children. 

*In fact* having children presents a financial and moral liability to the vast majority of people. I know in a world of 8 billion humans, it is difficult to speak about the importance of reproduction, but it is a hugely important issue.

*Precisely because* overpopulation, pollution, disease and war are not conducive to *long term human survivability* despite what any free market apologist wishes to say to you. Humans have to have somewhere to live. And when we’re living in a world in which nature might be pumping the brakes somehow *internally* in us to put a stop to overpopulation and environmental destruction, perhaps we ought to give it a little more attention than a passing glance. 

Demographers like to excitedly talk about how when “countries develop”, people will just naturally not have children anymore! Didn’t ya know? 

Except what all those demographers don’t mention is the usual: their opinions are based on assumptions of endless economic growth and resource availability. The ability of places like Japan or Germany to industrialize and just not have children anymore.., is completely dependent upon places like Nigeria or Ethiopia then continuing to produce people.

Go figure, countries and nations just can’t up and stop having children without it causing massive changes and problems for society as a whole. But how will places “develop” like Germany or Japan, when there are no “undeveloped” countries left pumping out people for the cheap slave labor for the benefits of the industrialized nation in question? 

What does a country or people do when they are effectively experiencing de-industrialization? That’s the place the US is in. Argue what one wants, if states like California, Florida (lol) and Texas aren’t included to make numbers look good, that’s been the story of huge swaths of the US. 

People can visit from somewhere in Eastern Europe, expecting to see nice places, having heard that the US is a wealth paradise their entire adult lives in their own countries and they get here and realize 90% of the US has de-industrialized and become forgotten. Don’t believe me? How many times have you heard a boss, coworker, neighbor, or other person in those communities say “It’s their fault for not competing!” Every time a town dries up and everyone leaves? 

At what point do we stop and say “Hey, you know, it would be nice if the US was a place in which actual respectable life can be pursued for the majority of people. That’s all they really ask for anyway, just a place to exist and not starve in humiliating drug addicted poverty.","2019-09-19 19:22:40","3","[deleted]","1747729186.703754","CO2 emissions","scientific"
