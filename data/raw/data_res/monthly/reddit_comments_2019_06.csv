The funny thing is that if it wasn't for the Internet, I would have zero knowledge of the collapse. I only know what's happening in faraway countries because of it. Since the news media is silent, I wouldn't even know about the floods in the US midwest without the Internet. I'd have no idea that we're already locked into at minimum 3ºC of global warming (or that this is a catastrophic amount of warming) by 2050. Or that there's this thing called ocean acidification and it's going to affect the amount of oxygen in the air.

Everybody around me still thinks that everything is wonderful. Sure, there are no birds in the sky, and  I haven't seen even one butterfly or caterpillar in 3 years, but hey! The local sportball team is playing its rival tonight, and beer is still affordable!","2019-06-05 21:42:21","55","republitard_2","1747817077.0425239","climate data","scientific"

People get older and become zombiefied. The media is there to not tell us the truth, and the haggard masses are almost never exposed to any semblance of reality. A lot of young people seem to understand (sometimes consciously, sometimes not) the lie that modern society is. More and more of them numb themselves in dangerous ways. 

Escapism is omnipresent for all age groups, and the media and a multitude of powerful entities tell us how to do it. Take a cruise! Fly here! Eat this shitty food! 

In what could be a very short time, the vast majority of people will be in a state of total shock.

"eq3lgjq","t3_bx3sj7","bx3sj7","collapse","skeptical",">  I can see that the news media, especially TV news outlets, are largely ignoring the most daunting and serous of threats to our civilization that are occurring, quite literally, as we speak. I also have no doubt they are well aware of what's happening. So many things are hitting so many places all over the world at the same time. You can almost feel things beginning to come undone. You can see that journalism has begun to shrink away from the real issues because they're becoming sooo big, they are so dire - that the corporate run media doesn't want to induce a panic as someone pointed out earlier in this sub. I think that's true. We're sheep following each other off a cliff, merrily humming along. The PTB want to get the loot and get out before too many people wake up to how precariously close to the end we are and we finally begin to fully react to that reality.

Don’t burden yourself too much. It is how it is. We are all social animals hierarchically led by Alpha-types. But they are as nervous and anxious as we all are. And things out there are quite fearful, aren’t they. So please, have mercy upon them and each one of us. We often long for that heroical fantasy, to mastering the storms in live, but fear is much more frequent though.

All those we wish to be our leaders in these stormy times are just as afraid as shit than we are. So they hide. 

Frankly, we are exposed to an undercurrent panic croaching up to us. Yet, while reality is hard, our imagination blows it up by proportions to be at magnitudes more horrific.

If you and me can be brave enough to confront the threats out there, fine. If not, no reason to blame. Let go what cannot be hold and pursue what can. Get over your sorrows and live. Give clemency to the ones, which are weak in the presence of the terrible.","2019-06-05 18:10:35","15","Hubertus_Hauger","1747817077.052609","climate data","scientific"

I come to /collapse because it feels raw and honest. It is hard to carry on knowing what we believe to be true (IS true) with one foot in our regular lives and the other foot awake, aware, and afraid.

Even though every moment is punctuated with the heaviness of what we’ve done to the planet (and do to each other, and our beautiful living creatures and ecosystems) there are still some truly beautiful moments in every day, and I try to focus on those as much as I can. Because otherwise ... I just don’t know. I don’t want to live in a world where we need to know hand-to-hand combat or how to light our own fires ...

That's because readers want to know about the new Apple monitor stand :) or Megan Markels baby 👶 :) There is a complete disconnect from what's important (the biosphere) when people become comfortable with their lot. If I am OK now, I will be OK tomorrow. They also use that to justify their stance if you're not OK, eg homeless, poor ? Must he your fault, look at me I am OK, so you can be too. Which proceeds to ignore the billions on who are not fucking OK at all often for no other reason then the geographic location of the vagina they came from, or modern societies narcissism that they can't cope with, so seek an out (like your daughter has).

>Now, I'll go on to where we're headed financially. We've got no ammunition left after 2008

on this you're wrong. The entire reason fait money exists is so politicians can support their pet projects, in the US this is endless military spending.  The one thing the US Government will never run out of is US Dollars.  I expect you'll see ramped up military spending, more people will be encouraged to enlist to 'serve their country', other carrots beside propaganda will also be made eg more student debt forgiveness etc

That they don't spread it around a little more equitably is because voters don't want them to, how do we know this because people keep re-electing the same representatives to government. So voters must either be ok with their representative, or they're idiots, on or the other :)

I could, of course, be too optimistic (first time for everything, I suppose) but there’s reasons to have hope that we will survive and thrive in the future. There’s also reason to hope that the little person I’m raising could be part of the solution. YMMV.","2019-06-06 20:59:35","19","Animastj","1747817453.843246","climate data","scientific"

I still believe we are not completely doomed, seeing the young generation being so proactive and the industries starting to realize that climate change is not an empty threat.","2019-06-06 20:03:58","3","kim_possimpible","1747817453.854593","climate data","scientific"

We have discussed waiting until it gets better, not having kids at all, having kids right now. After all the talking we have decided to have kids, not now but once we have found a place wed like to settle down. 

Have kids! They are the reason we want to clean up the planet, so we can give them something beautiful. If there isnt someone to pass this planet onto, then what are we even worrying about?","2019-06-07 04:39:40","2","mirmice","1747817453.8608441","climate data","scientific"
"eq9p71a","t3_bxqp0a","bxqp0a","sustainability","action-oriented","Admittedly I haven't read through your sources but, out of curiosity, do those figures refer only to the CO2 emissions associated with the running of the trains, presumably so considering how low they are?

Is there any mention in the report about the CO2 emissions associated with the construction of the channel tunnel? For example, the tunnel is, as far as I am aware, constructed almost entirely from precast concrete sections. The production of cement clinker results in a number of effluent, water usage and emission issues, not least a global average production rate of 0.83kg CO2 per 1kg of cement used ([https://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/tracking2007SUM.pdf](https://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/tracking2007SUM.pdf)). 

For reference, the average structural concrete mix is likely to contain between 14-20% cement (unless cement replacement materials such as PFA are used), with a typical density of concrete of 2400kg/m3 (direct knowledge - I am a qualified and practicing civil engineer). The channel tunnel actually consists of three tunnels, each circa 50km long, two of which are 7.6m in diameter and the service tunnel is 4.8m diameter ([https://www.getlinkgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/infrastructure/](https://www.getlinkgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/infrastructure/)). If we assume a wall thickness of the precast units at 200mm (unverified but a reasonable, if not probably under, estimation) and apply very simple maths, this equates to circa 11,083kg concrete per linear metre i.e. circa 1.6 tonnes CO2 per linear metre of the three tunnels i.e. 78 tonnes CO2 in the concrete for the tunnels alone. In actuality the figure is probably much higher, as the tunnels in reality will be longer than 50km.

This is considering the CO2 impact of the cement element of the concrete alone, there is the quarrying of aggregate for concrete production, plus the transportation and placement of the materials to consider also. Then there is the material used for the engineering fill, the additional cement that was probably used to stabilise and modify the soils for the rail heads etc. (which would likely have been poor due to their geographical location i.e. coastal), let alone the countless other energy hungry materials utilised, the transportation of said construction materials (including the concrete), and the emissions and damage caused by the construction activities, right down to the vans carrying the workmen to and from the site.

I know the channel tunnel was not constructed specifically for Eurostar, so it is something of a skewed example, but it is pertinent to raise the question of how long 'clean' infrastructure takes to offset the emissions associated with its' construction?

This is in no least means a challenge to your post, rather just an additional point that is often overlooked (and not necessarily by yourself). I wholeheartedly agree that transportation, particularly the switch from fossil fuel to (renewably generated) electrically powered mass transportation is essential to stem the tide of associated CO2 and other transport related emissions, but we need to ensure that we make the best use of the infrastructure we already have, rather than creating enormous civil engineering projects, complete with their associated emissions that would take the cleanest of technologies decades to offset.","2019-06-07 13:30:34","2","state_of_epoche","1747817474.8548841","climate data","scientific"
"eqa4urq","t3_bxqp0a","bxqp0a","sustainability","action-oriented","I agree with your point and I was concerned about the nuclear waste generated by reactors. But, I changed my view after I attended a talk about 'Molten Salt Reactor - MSR' by Seaborg technologies CEO Troels schönfeld.

Basically, they have made / conceptualised a way of making MSR smaller, safer and cheaper than conventional nuclear reactors. By doing this, they hope to capture a part of the market for energy production by making it competitive / cheaper than coal production by 2025.

The cherry on top is that they want to process nuclear waste. This is from their website: "" In the CMSR (Compact Molten Salt Reactor), the fuel is mixed into a molten fluoride salt which also acts as the coolant. This provides significant safety benefits.

If the fuel salt should ever come into contact with the atmosphere, it will simply cool down and turn into solid rock, containing all the radioactive material within itself.

The reactor will operate at near-atmospheric pressures and cannot overheat due to a frozen salt plug, that melt and drain the core to cooled tanks before damage can occur.""

So, all in all, I agree with you and I hope this nuclear technology alongwith others makes fossil fuels obsolete.","2019-06-07 16:33:06","2","karikakar09","1747817474.859456","climate data","scientific"

Nuclear energy still produces a byproduct that’s dangerous to the environment. Although it’s less impactful than coal, it’s still not considered “renewable energy.” Both coal and nuclear waste polute the environment in different ways, you just never hear of nuclear waste pollution because it’s contained - it’s not a gas like CO2. With that being said, I don’t think nuclear energy is the best route either.","2019-06-08 01:52:01","0","thervssian","1747817474.8659","climate data","scientific"
