"eq2hzwl","t3_bx1y18","bx1y18","sustainability","action-oriented","The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets the regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)).

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf), and [many nations have already started](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/). We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580). And the IPCC made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

[The U.S. could induce other nations to enact mitigation policies by enacting one of our own](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support; in fact, a majority in [every congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&type=value&geo=cd) and [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) supports a carbon tax, which [does help our chances of passing meaningful legislation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651).

People who prioritize climate change and the environment [have not been very reliable voters, which explains much of the lackadaisical response of lawmakers](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did), and many Americans don't realize we should be voting (on average) [in 3-4 elections per year](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did). In 2018 in the U.S., the percentage of voters prioritizing the environment [more than tripled](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/green/A-Green-Wave-Signs-Point-to-Voters-Demanding-Action-on-Climate-Change-502796391.html), and now [climate change is a priority issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal) for lawmakers.

3. [**Recruit**](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/). Most of us are [either alarmed or concerned](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Six-Americas-Februrary-2019.png) about climate change, yet most aren't taking [the necessary steps](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) to solve the problem -- the [most common reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6DoiQM_-is) is that no one asked. If all of us who are ['very worried'](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/03/21/worries-priorities-and-potential-problem-solvers/) about climate change organized we would be >26x more powerful than the NRA. According to [Yale data](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-May-2017.pdf), many of your friends and family would welcome the opportunity to get involved if you just asked. So please [volunteer](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved) or [donate](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/donate) to turn out environmental voters, and invite your friends and family to [lobby Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax).

§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

"eq9p71a","t3_bxqp0a","bxqp0a","sustainability","action-oriented","Admittedly I haven't read through your sources but, out of curiosity, do those figures refer only to the CO2 emissions associated with the running of the trains, presumably so considering how low they are?

Is there any mention in the report about the CO2 emissions associated with the construction of the channel tunnel? For example, the tunnel is, as far as I am aware, constructed almost entirely from precast concrete sections. The production of cement clinker results in a number of effluent, water usage and emission issues, not least a global average production rate of 0.83kg CO2 per 1kg of cement used ([https://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/tracking2007SUM.pdf](https://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/tracking2007SUM.pdf)). 

For reference, the average structural concrete mix is likely to contain between 14-20% cement (unless cement replacement materials such as PFA are used), with a typical density of concrete of 2400kg/m3 (direct knowledge - I am a qualified and practicing civil engineer). The channel tunnel actually consists of three tunnels, each circa 50km long, two of which are 7.6m in diameter and the service tunnel is 4.8m diameter ([https://www.getlinkgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/infrastructure/](https://www.getlinkgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/infrastructure/)). If we assume a wall thickness of the precast units at 200mm (unverified but a reasonable, if not probably under, estimation) and apply very simple maths, this equates to circa 11,083kg concrete per linear metre i.e. circa 1.6 tonnes CO2 per linear metre of the three tunnels i.e. 78 tonnes CO2 in the concrete for the tunnels alone. In actuality the figure is probably much higher, as the tunnels in reality will be longer than 50km.

This is considering the CO2 impact of the cement element of the concrete alone, there is the quarrying of aggregate for concrete production, plus the transportation and placement of the materials to consider also. Then there is the material used for the engineering fill, the additional cement that was probably used to stabilise and modify the soils for the rail heads etc. (which would likely have been poor due to their geographical location i.e. coastal), let alone the countless other energy hungry materials utilised, the transportation of said construction materials (including the concrete), and the emissions and damage caused by the construction activities, right down to the vans carrying the workmen to and from the site.

I know the channel tunnel was not constructed specifically for Eurostar, so it is something of a skewed example, but it is pertinent to raise the question of how long 'clean' infrastructure takes to offset the emissions associated with its' construction?

This is in no least means a challenge to your post, rather just an additional point that is often overlooked (and not necessarily by yourself). I wholeheartedly agree that transportation, particularly the switch from fossil fuel to (renewably generated) electrically powered mass transportation is essential to stem the tide of associated CO2 and other transport related emissions, but we need to ensure that we make the best use of the infrastructure we already have, rather than creating enormous civil engineering projects, complete with their associated emissions that would take the cleanest of technologies decades to offset.","2019-06-07 13:30:34","2","state_of_epoche","1747727412.3630521","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"eqa4urq","t3_bxqp0a","bxqp0a","sustainability","action-oriented","I agree with your point and I was concerned about the nuclear waste generated by reactors. But, I changed my view after I attended a talk about 'Molten Salt Reactor - MSR' by Seaborg technologies CEO Troels schönfeld.

Basically, they have made / conceptualised a way of making MSR smaller, safer and cheaper than conventional nuclear reactors. By doing this, they hope to capture a part of the market for energy production by making it competitive / cheaper than coal production by 2025.

The cherry on top is that they want to process nuclear waste. This is from their website: "" In the CMSR (Compact Molten Salt Reactor), the fuel is mixed into a molten fluoride salt which also acts as the coolant. This provides significant safety benefits.

If the fuel salt should ever come into contact with the atmosphere, it will simply cool down and turn into solid rock, containing all the radioactive material within itself.

The reactor will operate at near-atmospheric pressures and cannot overheat due to a frozen salt plug, that melt and drain the core to cooled tanks before damage can occur.""
