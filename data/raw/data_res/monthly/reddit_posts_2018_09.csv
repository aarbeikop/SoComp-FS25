"9c3fhs","climatechange","action-oriented","Gold standard, unbiased reviews of climate change data?","What are the most rigorous reviews of the existing data and debates on climate change? I'm looking for those 

* made by a panel of experts
* who are not financially or otherwise benefitting by setting forth a certain view
* where they clearly and openly admit every weakness and uncertainty in the data, and address all the critics

Is there a ""gold standard"" report of this kind?","2018-09-01 14:26:48","7","7","0.82","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9c3fhs/gold_standard_unbiased_reviews_of_climate_change/","True","tyrannus19","1747797315.7783701","climate data","scientific"

"9j0sb3","sustainability","action-oriented","thesis idea in environmental economics","i am currently in an apprenticeship as an iso 14001 certification manager and have to do a thesis in my environmental economics class. 

however my mentor is very nitpicky about numbers and subjects i can incorporate in the project. so this limits me. 

last year i did a paper on how environmental performance impacts economic performance. this year i am leaning toward ”climate change and the role of telecom companies in future societies”. i think i can use public-made articles and numbers from the company without ruffling feathers.

question is: i need to insert some economics tools and processes. like risk assessment or cost benefice. what do you recommend? any alternative ideas for econ tools?

i will talk about: big data, digitalization, csr, motivations and pressures from like limited resources. maybe do a swot diagram. what do you think.

please and thank you.","2018-09-26 08:53:42","2","2","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/9j0sb3/thesis_idea_in_environmental_economics/","True","overactive-bladder","1747798225.588635","climate data","scientific"
