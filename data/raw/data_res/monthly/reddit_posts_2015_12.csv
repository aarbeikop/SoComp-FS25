"3y08n7","sustainability","action-oriented","Greenhouse gas emissions of food","I'm interested to find some data on the greenhouse gas emissions of various food items. The best for me would be CO2 equivalent per kcal, since that would help me to see which things in my diet I could change to reduce emissions, while maintaining a healthful diet. Do any of you know any sources?

So far I've found [this](http://www.iinas.org/tl_files/iinas/downloads/food/2009_GHG_food.pdf) and [this](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/694/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10584-014-1169-1.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10584-014-1169-1&token2=exp=1450900953~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F694%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs10584-014-1169-1.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs10584-014-1169-1*~hmac=1579de0c40aea4a0a6ba0c629834526906a7c3b13322798c5417517fb739dfd4), which are from the uk and germany respectively. But I don't know whether they are trustworthy and they don't seem to match up well. (This could also mean that emissions are more dependent on production methods used in various countries than the food itself, but if that's the case I would like to find a reference for it as well.)","2015-12-23 21:06:13","7","6","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/3y08n7/greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_food/","True","Baradina","1747695422.255952","CO2 emissions","scientific"
