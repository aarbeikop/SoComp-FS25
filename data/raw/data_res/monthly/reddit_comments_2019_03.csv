I tried to do it empirically from annual emissions a while back and crudely found that 'about 10 years' was a good lag estimate, but I'd like something better than my rough estimates. That is, if we were to double CO2 levels today and it would end up increasing global temperatures by 3 degrees or so, is that 2 degrees after 5 years and 3 degrees after 10 years, 2 degrees after 20 years and 3 degrees after 30 years, etc.?","2019-03-18 01:22:58","9","hammertime84","1747722447.1985228","CO2 emissions","scientific"

The problem we have is simply the fact that there are too many people living like kings.","2019-03-18 13:03:35","6","Enkaybee","1747722447.2011032","CO2 emissions","scientific"

This also doesn't count the damage to forests which will reduce the rate of atmospheric CO2 reduction...","2019-03-18 04:49:44","3","[deleted]","1747722447.203659","CO2 emissions","scientific"
