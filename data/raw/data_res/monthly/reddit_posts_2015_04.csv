We are signing off now, but feel free to keep posting your questions and we will try to answer as many as we can.

We are three researchers from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and one from Utah State University’s Department of Environment & Society. We are excited to answer your questions about how Americans in different parts of the country compare in their climate change beliefs, attitudes, and policy support.

This week, we released a new interactive mapping tool called “Yale Climate Opinion Maps” (YCOM) and an accompanying peer-reviewed paper in the journal Nature Climate Change. This tool allows users to visualize and explore differences in public opinion about global warming in the United States in unprecedented geographic detail. Nationally, 52% of Americans are worried about global warming. But this national number glosses over the enormous geographic diversity in public opinion across the country – diversity that is revealed for the first time in these maps. Explore the maps at: http://environment.yale.edu/poe/v2014/. 

We undertook this project because most of the action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate impacts is happening at the state and local levels of American society. Yet most know little about public climate change opinion at these sub-national levels. State and local surveys are costly and time intensive, and as a result most public opinion polling is only done at the national level. 

The estimates contained in the tool are based on a geographic and statistical model developed by our research team at Yale and Utah State University. The model uses the large quantity of national survey data that we have collected over the years — over 13,000 individual survey responses since 2008 — to estimate differences in opinion between geographic and demographic groupings. As a result, we are able to provide high-resolution estimates of public climate change understanding, risk perceptions, and policy support in all 50 states, 435 Congressional districts, and 3,000+ counties across the United States.
