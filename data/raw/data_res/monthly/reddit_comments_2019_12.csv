As someone going to school for geoengineering, I'm stoked that it is finally getting some funding.  I don't know how much should be implemented, but I know it must be seriously considered if we are going to avoid the worst of climate change.","2019-12-27 05:39:10","80","rNdOrchestra","1747731308.617331","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"fc5a3uy","t3_eg6spy","eg6spy","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","Good, and this is yet another good thing falling into place. I understand the argument of ‘we need to cut all emissions!’ and I don’t disagree, but the firm reality is that they certainly won’t be cut to the degree the P1 pathway requires, and it will take at least another 10-20 years before I think we see meaningful quantities cut.

The IPCC laid out a number of pathways to achieving the best scenario for a reason, and anyone who would be arguing against geoengineering isn’t looking at this issue very rationally.  Bring it on!","2019-12-27 12:43:38","22","Crasino_Hunk","1747731308.620553","CO2 emissions","scientific"

The Green New Deal is something that can help, there are some improvements & additions into it like building better power grids, improving battery storage, developing low-carbon jet plane fuel, electrifying industrial processes, building cities more densely, phasing-out HFCs, developing lab-grown meat, building better nuclear plants, upgrading our thermostats, increase mass transit ridership, scaling up carbon capture technology, stop the corporate rich from increasing oil & also cease climate denialism from spreading.","2019-12-27 14:51:49","15","faithslayer202","1747731308.6246169","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"fc5rpc1","t3_eg6spy","eg6spy","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","Yes, research ""last resort"" options.  But it would be a self-inflicted disaster to rely on experimental therapy to save the planet.  Even carbon capture from the atmosphere must not be treated as a free pass to continue ""business as usual"".  The question should be: what is the least expensive and most equitable path for mitigating climate change?  If there is insufficient political will to implement rational policy, then we should recognize that deferring effective action into the future, based on more expensive and much more risky schemes, is a mirage -- the last refuge of climate denialism.","2019-12-27 16:33:29","8","coolbern","1747731308.626919","CO2 emissions","scientific"

"fc8dzap","t3_eg6spy","eg6spy","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","A very informed opinion indeed. But even between your two statements; initially talking about the collapse of civilization and finally resting on a dramatically different civilization, that's a big difference. Still, I'd be surprised if civilization changes dramatically different on that time scale.

I think initially with your numbers you're getting at the essence of this graph;

Every year we delay it gets harder to hit the Paris Agreement goals as it requires a higher percentage of emission cuts. Currently we're looking at ~7% reduction per year if we start now iirc. Which equates to a gigaton or so of CO2 emissions.

As far as trees and carbon removal technologies; yes currently they're far from enough which is why the primary goal has always been decarbonization of our economy in talks like Paris and most recently in Madrid. While it is pretty bleak as you've pointed out (I continually think I'm on a fool's errand getting an education on CO2 removal with concentrations around 415 ppm), these technologies are in their infancy and have a lot of potential for growth. Unfortunately, enhanced oil recovery is certainly a current use for captured CO2, other projects such as CarbFix in Iceland sequester it as carbonate rock which is so far the only direct method for long term removal. From an engineers perspective, trees are not a long term removal strategy as they can result in rapid emissions of anything they have captured just as you pointed out in Australia, but also in California these past two summers.

I can't speak with any informed opinion on human behavior. I'm a scientist and engineer, and not versed in that. Instead, what I'll propose is a human behavior tool that will give us serious ammunition to fight this on an economic front. Carbon Tax.  Why this hasn't been implemented in my country (US) already is beyond silly as it was suggested by economists back in the days of George W Bush.  Corporations, and often in this case utility companies, rarely changed unless regulations demand it.  This is the overarching regulation we need to see rapid changes.

You also touched on feedback loops. Yeah these are incredibly scary. I think part of how scary they are is we don't know enough about them. We know it's a lot emissions laying in wait and that eventually they will get released should we continue warming.  I think something to keep in mind with all of this and CO2/CH4 emissions is that there is a lag period between the emissions and the maximum greenhouse effect we see.  I'm not fresh on the numbers but I believe it is on the order of a decade or two.  Not much time to breathe easy, but perhaps enough time to act.

Putting all of this onto consumerism is a little strange to me, but it seems we come from very different backgrounds. I'd encourage you to look at the above chart of where the emissions are coming from by each section. I think a safe assumption is that consumerism accounts for part of the transportation portion and the industry portion. Certainly part of the problem, and perhaps a large chunk of those two, but still not two thirds of the pie. What I would like to hear from you is the numbers on emissions being correlated to economic activity.  I have a very hard time wrapping my head around a third reduction in emissions bringing about a third reduction in economy.  But, again, this is not something I am highly educated in so I'd love any feedback you may have.

I can't point to charts or graphs for my last points, so take for it what you will.  Throughout history we've seen many moments where we thought civilization was going to end; world wars, y2k, black plague, 2008 financial crisis, etc..  Yet here civilization is.  Humans are resilient, I believe that.  I don't think we've been tested quite like this, but I also believe in us.  I believe in us for two reasons; one being the history I mentioned and, two is the fact that if we give into despair we've certainly lost.  While we may be losing, we haven't lost yet.","2019-12-28 11:32:47","1","rNdOrchestra","1747731308.6389608","CO2 emissions","scientific"
