I saw [this tweet yesterday](https://twitter.com/harrisonlingren/status/824371807503400968), so I went ahead and downloaded all of the climate change data I could from NOAA's ftp site as a backup just in case anything were to happen to it. I have created a torrent for the data, and am going to seed it as long as I can. Please download and seed the data for yourselves as well so we can make sure this data is not lost due to any rash actions on behalf of the US leadership.

You can grab the torrent using this link: http://mgnet.me/cqwDdJa

I'm not sure if there is a better way to do this, but here is what the file/folder structure of the data looks like: http://pastebin.com/udcY3EBz

"5qdhgk","climate","scientific","Exfiltrating climate data without getting caught: a practical guide for leakers and activists","We've had a few instances of people trying to leak data, promote direct action, and the likes.  Here's quick guide to how to make yourself a bit harder to catch:

1. Don't leave digital traces while copying data. Write stuff down on a pad which belongs to you, and take it home. Photograph your screen. Don't create files with copies of the data you are planning to exfiltrate on your work computer. If the data is on an internal web server, try to access what you are planning to leak in the form of multiple partial queries over a period of time, instead of as one big query. If you have large volumes of data, save it on a never-used-before USB drive and bring that home. Don't ever use that USB drive for anything else again.  
2. Don't use work-owned equipment to post from. Many employers have monitoring software installed, and will easily be able to see who posted what. Don't use equipment where you've installed employer-supplied monitoring software to post.
If you just read this, on equipment which might be monitored, wait a while before posting anything sensitive.  Don’t give somebody who is watching a chance to correlate your seeing this with a post right after that.
2. Install tor.  You can get it at http://tor.eff.org.  This is a special browser which is slow, but provides strong anonymity.  It will prevent anybody at your ISP (if they’re watching) from knowing what sites you visit with it, and it will prevent any sites you visit from knowing what the IP address of your computer is.  This will make it much harder for either of them to identify you.
3. Use the Tor browser for posting your leak.  You must follow [these linked instructions](https://tor.eff.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning) to make sure tor really works to protect your identity. The instructions about never opening a downloaded file are vitally important — things like .doc and .pdf files can contain software which will expose who you are.
4. The instruction about using an https version of a web site instead of the plain old http version is also very important.  This is because while tor provides very strong anonymity, it doesn’t provide a secure connection to the web site — the https connection to the site does that.
5. If you're posting to a social site like reddit, or twitter, or leaking via email, you’ll need to set up a new account for posting your leak.  If you’ve got an account which you have used when not on tor, then gmail, twitter, reddit, etc. can identify the IP address of your computer from previous sessions.  If you’ve ever posted anything on an account, there’s a good chance you’ve leaked information about yourself.  Don’t take this risk, and just use a new account exclusively for leaking.
6. Do NOT post files from standard editors, like Word, Excel, or photos from your camera. Most programs and recording equipment embed metadata in their files, like the identify of the creator, the serial number of a camera, and the likes in their files which can be used to identify you. Plain old .txt files may be ok, provided that you [clean them in an editor which displays zero-width whitespace characters](https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2017-12-30-zero-width-characters).  Retype data into a plain text editor if you can.   Pretty much anything else risks your identity. The secure drop systems used by some news outlets like ProPublica and the New York Times may be able to strip this kind of thing, but ask a journalist about your specific file format first.
7. After posting the leak, you need to NEVER use that account for any purpose not directly tied to the leak, since you may make the mistake of giving away your identity.
8. If you want to leak to the press (which may get broader coverage, but may also decide not to publish at all) organizations like [ProPublica](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/01/how-easy-is-it-to-securely-leak-information-to-some-of-americas-top-news-organizations-this-easy/) and the [New York Times]( https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2016/news-tips/#securedrop) have special drop boxes set up to allow the posting, which are linked above.
9. If you are leaking printed matter, be aware that all color-capable printers include grid of yellow dots which contains the printer model, serial number, and time of printing.  [Printed documents, and scanned versions of them, are easily attributable to the person whose account was used to print them](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/06/how-a-few-yellow-dots-burned-the-intercepts-nsa-leaker/).  Consider retyping any such document prior to leaking it.  Also, be aware that the act of printing a document is often tracked by government agencies, and relatively few print a given document.  This can make it easy to track you down.","2017-01-26 22:56:48","33","4","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/5qdhgk/exfiltrating_climate_data_without_getting_caught/","True","silence7","1747768423.9007401","climate data","scientific"

# Hello there /r/Science!

We are a group of researchers who just published [a new open access paper in *Science Advances*](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1601207.full) showing that ocean warming was indeed being underestimated, confirming the conclusion of a paper last year that triggered a series of political attacks. You can find some press coverage of our work at [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-pause-in-ocean-warming/), [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/04/noaa-challenged-the-global-warming-pause-now-new-research-says-the-agency-was-right/?utm_term=.e9b8eb3f3628), and [the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/global-warming-hiatus-never-happened-say-climate-scientists-1.3922378). One of the authors, Kevin Cowtan, has [an explainer on his website](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/ihsst2016/background.html) as well as [links to the code and data](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~kdc3/papers/ihsst2016/methods.html) used in the paper.

For backstory, in 2015 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) updated its global temperature dataset, showing that their previous data had been underestimating the amount of recent warming we've had. The change was mainly from their updated ocean data (i.e. their sea surface temperature or ""SST"") product. 

The NOAA group's updated estimate of warming formed the basis of high profile paper in Science ([Karl et al. 2015](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469)), which joined a growing chorus of papers (see also [Cowtan and Way, 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.2297/abstract); [Cahill et al. 2015](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/8/084002); [Foster and Rahmstorf 2016](http://docdro.id/pwnUlm7)) pushing back on the idea that there had been a ""pause"" in warming.

This led to Lamar Smith (R-TX), the Republican chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee to accuse NOAA of deliberately ""altering data"" for nefarious ends, and issue a series of public attacks and subpoenas for internal communications that were characterized as [""fishing expeditions""](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/10/30/global_warming_lamar_smith_s_conspiracy_ideations.html), [""waging war""](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2015/1119/Why-is-Lamar-Smith-waging-war-on-a-NOAA-global-warming-study), and a [""witch hunt""](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22112015/ranking-congresswoman-defends-NOAA-climate-change-scientists-from-witch-hunt-lamar-smith).

Rather than subpoenaing people's emails, we thought we would check to see if the Karl et al. adjustments were kosher a different way- by doing some science! 

We knew that a big issue with SST products had to do with the transition from mostly ship-based measurements to mostly buoy-based measurements. Not accounting for this transition properly could hypothetically impart a cool bias, i.e. cause an underestimate in the amount of warming over recent decades. So we looked at three ""instrumentally homogeneous"" records (which wouldn't see a bias due to changeover in instrumentation type, because they're from one kind of instrument): only buoys, satellite radiometers, and Argo floats. 

We compared these to the major SST data products, including the older (ERSSTv3b) and newer (ERSSTv4) NOAA records as well as the HadSST3 (UK's Hadley Centre) and COBE-SST (Japan's JMA) records. We found that the older NOAA SST product was indeed underestimating the rate of recent warming, and that the newer NOAA record appeared to correctly account for the ship/buoy transition- i.e. the NOAA correction seems like it was a good idea! We also found that the HadSST3 and COBE-SST records appear to underestimate the amount of warming we've actually seen in recent years.
