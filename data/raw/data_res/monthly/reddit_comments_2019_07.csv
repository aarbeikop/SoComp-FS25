"euehdew","t3_cfy5wh","cfy5wh","collapse","skeptical","I agree this is a problem but I think what you’re missing about your analysis of the difficulty to catch up is the same reason we are in trouble. A logarithmic-ish equation for carbon emission increases. There’s a randomness factor you have to take into account that makes our progress towards lower emissions non linear in my eyes. Once we start putting our money towards green technology , even more than now, emissions will decrease non linearly.  The more we put into science the better odds we have of figuring out the  battery storage problem or more efficient renewable energy. If we do nothing we certainly die if we do something we may die. 
I’m a gambling man and I rather take those odds.
