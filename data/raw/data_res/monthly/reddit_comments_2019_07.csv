"eu83eg2","t3_cf7msp","cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","I was born in the early 80s in the western United States.  We grew up totally aware of the potential consequences. And still my parents got big gas guzzling vehicles because they were more comfortable in them and I think also because they thought if climate change was really a threat then we'd be doing something about it. 

And then there was a time around the late 90s where even smart conscious people thought that maybe climate change wasn't really happening or it wasn't going to be that bad. 

I moved to Chicago in the early 00s and rode my bike/public transit, didn't have a car was a vegetarian etc... But somewhere around 2014 I gave up and I started to have that thought in the back of my consciousness that - if it was really this bad we'd be doing more. It was at that same time that I was graduating with a degree in chemical engineering and started working in the medical device field. Still supporting climate change action, but just not on my mind so much...

Then I decided to actually read the IPCC's Oct 2018 report and study it... Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! 

My fucking in-laws can't even eat a meal without bitching about paper straws how the fuck are we going to convince them that they can't eat a lb of beef with every fucking meal???  How are we going to convince them that maybe they need to live a little more humbly?  Convince them to trust scientific consensus when they think the son of a god is going to return from the dead at any moment and rule over the Earth for 1,000 years?

Happiness is a biological process. And we have the same biological brains as our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The things that make us happy are the same things that were available to them two hundred thousand years ago. The keys to happiness are older than civilization itself. You can still obtain happiness even while civilization is collapsing. The big three things you need to be happy are:

1. You need a close relationships with friends or family. 
2. You need a sense of contributing to the community. 
3. You need a connection with nature.

Buddhist monks, who give away all their possessions, are the happiest and strongest people I've ever met.  It's not about reliance on God.  It's about reliance on yourself with the wisdom to recognize your strengths, your limitations, and the inter-connectedness of all things.

You’re still comparing yourself with fellow humans, and agonizing over how they are enjoying life in blissful ignorance while you suffer. Why not suffer more?

I mean. Why be envious of idiotic fellow consumers when you can feel the epic unfairness that our species has unloaded on the entire fucking planet. /s

In all seriousness, though, there’s no one “right” way to feel. There is no precedence that I am aware of in our collective culture, literature or art that could be a guide on how best to react to our deliberate, unthinking killing-off of an entire biosphere, the only one we have ever known. This is, emotionally speaking, completely unchartered territory. We may be aware of the five stages of grief, but, again, that was studied in terms of known situations; it wasn’t framed for the death and destruction of absolutely everything we hold dear. So who’s to say what the right way to react is?

The best we can do is to live with kindness, compassion, courage. And be nice to each other - even to the assholes revving their gas guzzlers. Maybe forgive them for they know not what they do?

This is kind of about how you are looking at it, and how you look at it is a choice; you could also choose to say: 

I know that the human race is coming to an end; I know that I have nothing left to lose because all is lost. I understand that there is no point in worrying about the things I can not change; it is better to focus that energy on things I can change.

If I focus on building a life filled with quality moments and put the painful ones behind me, I can still build an environmentally conscious lifestyle and find ways to enjoy myself on the way down.
