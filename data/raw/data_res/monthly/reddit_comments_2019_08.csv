"ex6162l","t3_cri7pj","cri7pj","climatechange","action-oriented","Done this, can recommend. Although the forest part is difficult, trees are slow-growers. It attracts many birds, bees, butterflies and other insects (spiders, worms, slugs, moths), plus their predators (cats, foxes). It smells divine and I sometimes eat some of the berries. It's an oasis for the animals in an urban desert. I think it looks amazing but I know some people think it's ""untidy"". I am like yes and that's the way it's meant to be. My neighbors have complained once about a ""large amount of vegetation"". It was trimmed. It takes up a large amount of water, stores a large amount of carbon, nourishes the soil, prevents erosion and hosts a compost heap. The compost heap recycles all the green waste, onsite with no transport or disposal costs. The recycled nutrients never leave the property and instead make the garden even bigger. Dry woody waste, which can be up to 50% pure carbon, is stored in a flat pile which I occasionally walk/jump on and rake out the smashed pieces over the ground, where I leave them to rot amongst leaf litter. It makes the ground a bit higher, I'm considering making some terracing. I'm a bit worried about a fire. As a fire-break I do keep a clear perimeter - with lawn on it - near the house.

Edit: more (I love this topic) - it creates ecosystems, of many kinds. It breeds all kinds of animals and they go and make healthier ecosystems on the surrounding properties. I am worried it might be a home for rats, but I'm hoping the cats will fix that. It's a fabulous opportunity to get hands-on with the workings of ecosystems, evolution and nature. The metaphors and lessons that are contained within are broadly applicable to all ecosystems, all life. All I do is remove the stuff I don't want. I occasionally dump collected rainwater on the compost heap. That's an ecosystem all to itself. One of the birds has figured out that when I rearrange the compost heap, it's feeding time. He loves the spiders and also small bugs. He will hover for spiders. He's got so bold he will get in the way of me watering it. He sings quietly to himself as he patiently awaits the next insect to break cover.

Edit: more 2 (...) - it also keeps me fit, gives me some sun, purifies my air, and gives me time away from work, my screens, and indoors in general.

Case in point, the impossible burger is the perfect example. The basic tenet is that people are just not going to give up beef, and we have to trick them to do so.

In this case, i believe it is a great idea but i highly doubt you can move even a fraction of the household to do so. Social inertia is difficult to overcome. The question is that, given limited resources, what should we push people to do. I believe turning to green energy may be the easiest, than say ask them to drastically change how they manage their lawn.

>If 100 million homes in the US stopped maintaining their lawns, that would put a pretty large dent in total greenhouse gas emissions,

From the article:

>So in the end, a neatly manicured swatch of green could end up producing the equivalent amount of greenhouse gas emissions as one transcontinental flight every year. That adds up to an estimated US total equivalent of about 25 million tons of carbon dioxide, [Appalachian State University geochemist Chuanhui Gu] said.

>That's a tiny piece of the total US carbon emissions of 6 billion-plus tons in 2012

25m / 6b = 0.42%

"ex62sed","t3_cri7pj","cri7pj","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm not a US resident, so I'm not sure how things work there (with the HOA posts and whatever) but a bigger concern for me is the absolute lack of biodiversity in such gardens and the water (which also gets poluted by all those fertilizers and pesticides) needed to keep those pristine, greener-than-green lawns.

Here in Switzerland is common to see public green spaces with tall grass until June or so. This allows insects to populate those places and when cut down, some patches are left untouched so they can still migrate somewhere near and safe. I gotta say, seeing all the flowers and sometimes kids or dogs play in there is nice :-) In suburban areas with a lot of one-family homes, short grass is the norm though...

Also, since this country is so very densely populated, there's a lack of natural environments where biodiversity can be left to it's own devices, so this kind of things are really needed. In the Americas there's still tons of more or less untouched landscapes, something with lack in Europe.","2019-08-17 10:29:29","1","Chonono","1747728314.32494","CO2 emissions","scientific"

The money you would spend on tree maintenance could better be used for solar panels or something.  
   I do see homeowners with vast acreage in the suburbs mowing, watering, and fertilizing their entire property for some reason. Also some folks way too worried about dandelions or other such weeds are constantly dumping chemicals in their yards to control them.
