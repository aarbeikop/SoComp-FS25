I am doing the research rn but I need some historical climate data of the years 1814,1815, 1816 and 1817. But google research just throws sites with data no older than 1945. If you know where I can get that information that would be really helpful!","2019-07-04 17:04:01","2","6","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/c94ybz/i_need_historical_climate_data/","True","pixelcaesar","1747818009.301759","climate data","scientific"

"cfy5wh","collapse","skeptical","Hothouse Mass Extinction Fraud = Worse Than Expected","The oceans are acidifying 10X faster than in all earth's history, and when they reach a ""critical threshold"", ocean acidification will explode 100X faster than now, killing all sea shell creatures in its wake. These micro-shelled creatures form the basis for food on earth. Life on land depends on life in the ocean. Ocean acidification makes it harder for phytoplankton to absorb nutrients. We need phytoplankton to breathe.

Micro-plastics in the ocean are killing the plankton that produce 10% of earth's oxygen.

And that's just the oceans. On land we have destroyed 98% of the mega-fauna on earth and replaced them with cows. There are 25 billion chickens on earth.

Germany's green energy miracle is so completely fraudulent as to defy description. Here's just one example: They burn over 60% of their recycling refuse. Their forests are dying, and they're moving whole villages to get at some the dirtiest coal in the world.

The Insurance Journal recently said we have to cut emissions 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 3° C by 2100. Claire Fyson of Climate Analytics says the same thing. Stefan Rahmstorf says we have to cut emissions 100% in 20 years to avoid 2° C.

Here's the problem, 2° C on land is the equivalent of the critical threshold danger for our oceans. Hitting 2° C will trigger five major feedbacks, which will trigger 8 other major feedbacks, leading to runaway mass extinction and runaway hothouse climate catastrophe. 

Here's the really, really bad news: even if we managed to increase our carbon budget 50%, we would only gain 10 years to cut emissions. But there's a flip side to this because arctic methane emissions are not modelled, and will likely cut our carbon budget by up to 50%, meaning we will have 10 years less to cut emissions.

But it gets worse still, because we are slamming headlong into runaway mass extinction ahead of runaway hothouse climate change. Both runaway hothouse earth and runaway mass extinction cannot be stopped or reversed once they tip past that critical threshold. But it gets worse.

We have to cut emissions 50% in 10 years to save the planet, otherwise ocean acidification will go into overdrive and reach mass extinction escape velocity, but China will not even begin to significantly reduce emissions until 2030 at the earliest. But it gets worse.

**If the IT sector were a country, it would rank 3rd in energy use, after China and the USA**

The 4 main sub-sectors to IT are: 1. devices 2. networks 3. data centers 4. manufacturing.

Data Centers: Used 21% of total IT energy use in 2017.

- Google uses 16 data centers to run 40,000 searches/second.

- Data centers used 320 Terra Watt Hours (TWHs) of energy/yr in 2012.

- 320 TWHs of data center energy use was 2% of total energy use in 2012.

- Streaming video is projected to increase data center energy use from 2% up to 13% of total energy use.

Networks: Used 29% of total IT energy use in 2017.

- Network energy use increased from 219 TWHs, in 2007, to 354 TWHs in 2012.

- 354 TWHs could power 32 million US homes for 1 year.

- Network energy use is growing 10% / yr.

- Steaming will grow to 80% of internet traffic by 2020.

Devices: Used 34% of total IT energy use in 2017.

Manufacturing: Used 16% of total IT energy use in 2017.

Netflix sucks at green energy compared to Google, and I fucking hate Google, even more than Netflix. 

https://youtu.be/Byl87SBFoo8

Netflix just lost 17 billion bucks in market value the other day, and I'm cutting my subscription. I'm sure that'll finish them off, just in time for next year's financial crash. A financial crash is when people could care less about the climate than they do now. They also tend to vote for populist nationalists more.

To stay below 1.5 C we have to cut emissions 100% by 2050.

To stay below 1.5 C we can only emit 420 gtons C02 total.

Even if we managed to change the 420 gton budget by 50% up, or by 50% down, we only get 10 years more, or 10 years less time to cut emissions 100%.

If methane emissions increase enough to  shrink our carbon budget to 220 gtons, then we have to cut emissions 100% by 2040 they say.

Mass extinction not included.

I think this means if we don't cut emissions 50% in 10 years, we'll never make it. Emissions will go up between 10-15% in the next 10 years.

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% in your lifetime. 

If you are 30 years old, emissions went up 60% in your lifetime. 

After 30 years trying, solar and wind are < 3% of total world energy use. 

Just think of the last 10 years. since 2009, emissions went up some 15%.

Can you take 10 more years of the same old bullshit, I know I can't.

Here's the part that everybody will hate, Bernie Sanders and AOC will not stop any of this.","2019-07-21 11:45:20","478","204","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cfy5wh/hothouse_mass_extinction_fraud_worse_than_expected/","True","CommonEmployment","1747818515.880615","climate data","scientific"
