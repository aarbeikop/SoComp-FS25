I can't tell you how many times I've been in somebody's home, it's \~72F degrees inside with the AC running, and \~60F degrees outside.  Huge waste of energy considering you could just open the windows and take advantage of zero-carbon, free cooling.  But we're so used to just turning a blind eye and letting the HVAC system do its thing to keep our desired temperature.

Recently I've become very interested in energy-passive buildings, such as Earthships and other earth-sheltered or high-mass homes.  Some of these homes are in the desert of New Mexico and literally use zero energy to cool the air.  Pipes or ducts will pull air from outside through low-temperature soil underground, providing cool air into the space.  The occupant opens a window near the ceiling and the hot air naturally rises out, creating suction to pull the cool air in through the underground ducts.  No compressors, no fans, just zero-energy air conditioning.

I keep my home at 68'f during the winter.  Visitors complain. I say, ""put on a sweater"". My bill is usually half of the neighbours that own modern homes, built 60 to 80 years later.","2019-05-09 23:28:47","5","demonlemonade","1747726716.904206","CO2 emissions","scientific"

"eme1yxr","t3_bh2pjg","bh2pjg","sustainability","action-oriented","Carbon offset is nice idea but does very little to help prevent climate change.

The main problem is the co2 you spend is released in minutes all in one go, then the offset scheme will invest in a project that will try and 'remove' the same amount of co2 over a rediculous long time.

Plant a tree and it won't be sequestering a significant amount of carbon for 20 years. 

I think the schemes are proud doing ok things but the logic to say it offsets immediate emmisions is rediculously flawed. You can't buy your way out of polluting.","2019-05-03 07:06:59","1","TheHucumber","1747726732.291882","CO2 emissions","scientific"
"eof1fnn","t3_brm5mj","brm5mj","sustainability","action-oriented","This approach kind of implies that

a) by saving money you'd spend more time sitting at home not consuming anything (with the lights and AC off), and

b) you don't create any other sort of 'value' at your work.

&#x200B;

Better perhaps to spend a portion of your paycheck offsetting the CO2 your company emits (or pressure your company to do this tax-efficiently themselves) and then make your other spending decisions as normal.","2019-05-22 09:24:40","4","Happy-Engineer","1747726745.777299","CO2 emissions","scientific"

I think this is an interesting example to use as it also poses the question of local pollution (driving a car puts the exhaust fumes directly into the air a lot of people then have to breathe before it has much time to be diluted with cleaner air).

I think that short-term emissions can be at least partially mitigated through buying offsets, and for longer term we need to be working towards solutions that can be as close to zero emissions as possible (eg. the electric car may be the better choice even if it runs on coal-powered electricity at first because the coal plant can and will be replaced with a more sustainable option without you having to change your car).","2019-05-22 10:04:14","1","jvatic","1747726745.780674","CO2 emissions","scientific"

The assertion that people wouldn't work if they didn't have to buy an ev, and instead take a break in their career and staying home or retire erliear is not realistic, people will work to survive no matter if they work from home or drive a Humvee or in places like NYC or tokyo where most people use public transportation.

Buying used vs new; it's usually said it's better to buy used, not causing the production of a new car instead 'reusing' existing vehicles, even used ev for that matter, tho i'm not entirely convinced that's true.","2019-05-22 11:05:59","1","zxcsd","1747726745.783405","CO2 emissions","scientific"
