"d8q7195","t3_579v6t","579v6t","science","scientific","We've been seeing some news reports about how global warming is expected to make hurricanes worse in the coming century.  I'm concerned that such claims may not be well supported by the science.  I build and run numerical simulations of electromechanical systems for my job.  As such, I know that its important not to ask a question of a model that the model hasn't been designed to answer.  I'm concerned that there are variables involved in hurricane formation that the climate models may not have been designed to answer, and that public-facing climatologists are going out on a weak limb when they claim that hurricanes will get worse going forward.  As I understand it, the points in favor (of stronger and more damaging storms) are:

 * Higher baseline sea level means that storm surge + high tide bring the sea farther inland.
 * Warmer oceans mean more heat available for powering hurricanes.

But there are many other factors involved that the climate-scale models may not be capturing, or that the model runs aren't being inspected for these features.  Things that I know about as a layman include:

 * Vertical wind shear can kill a storm that otherwise has plenty of available energy.
 * Ingesting the Saharan Air Layer can rob a storm of valuable atmospheric moisture.
 * Upper level atmospheric steering patterns may change, leading to fewer (or more) storms making landfall.
 * Climate-scale models are typically run at a lower resolution, so that 100's of years can be simulated in a reasonable time.  While climate models are closely related to weather models, IIUC climate-scale model runs aren't even capable of generating hurricanes.

My question: Are the other changes in wind and air mass patterns favorable or unfavorable for hurricane formation and steering as the CO2 levels continue to rise?  Do we even know right now?

"d8q8a26","t3_579v6t","579v6t","science","scientific","Many thanks for your AMA. This is slightly off-topic, I have a question about earth winds visualizations. I keep seeing these bands where winds from two systems/directions hit on each other, effectively cancelling each other out. They are more pronounced in this visualization [Earth Winds](https://earth.nullschool.net/) but you can also see them on [Ventusky](https://www.ventusky.com/). Go just south of Iceland (-18.95,54.66) and you see a long band of zero wind velocity.

Now, i am used to such things as an engineer and doing fluids simulations, take for example an extensional flow profile. But I am confused about what is happening, since a mass balance doesn't seem to work here. Sorry for the many questions, but:

*Are the winds really cancelling each other out?

*Are the winds in these bands being pushed in the upper atmosphere, thus not showing on this kind of visualization? 

*Do they have a name? I kept searching something like stagnant wind bands on oceans, but i can't find anything

*Are these known from sailors, from the past, because although you just spend a few days sailing with nice winds, all of a sudden you are stuck in such a band?","2016-10-13 13:54:07","3","booble_dooble","1747764420.774752","climate data","scientific"
