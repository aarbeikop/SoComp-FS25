"dtrp8j2","t3_7veehb","7veehb","climatechange","action-oriented","The causes of climate change surround disruption of the carbon cycle. Therefore, the threats/challenges arise when we alter the environment in such a way as to change how this cycle functions naturally. 

Technology deployment is important, but only one part of the puzzle. Land-use change, for example, is important as dense forests and certain soil types serve as enormous carbon sinks. When these lands are rendered unable to perform this function, the carbon cycle is changed and we see more carbon in the atmosphere with the corresponding effects.

The same could be said for behavioral changes in energy consumption (think buying products produced closer to home, or implementing more stringent building codes so as to waste less energy [building energy use is one of the world's biggest chellenges when it comes to energy efficiency]) or transportation networks and supply chains, which brings in a conversation about global economic structures, but you see where I'm going.

The point is, when it comes to CC, loading everyone up to the gills with solar panels and wind turbines isn't the end all, be all. There are a lot of activities and processes we do with our global economy that affect natural systems, including the carbon cycle. 

Technology deployment is important, but not the ultimate solution. This coming from someone is in the renewable energy project development space...","2018-02-05 14:02:43","5","allomities","1747962569.25238","green energy transition","manual"
"dtrnaoq","t3_7veehb","7veehb","climatechange","action-oriented","I have an unpopular opinion.  Those who would down vote me for offering an opinion, please just go for it, knowing that voting is designed for highlighting (or not) comments that engender discussion, not as a mechanism for agreeing with the post.  Downvoting and then replying to my comment, even to tell me I'm an idiot is counter to the whole voting mechanism.

Anyway, my unpopular opinion is that increase in GHGs is not a big threat to climate.  There are a lot of reasons for this, the biggest of which is that when one looks at historical records, increases in CO2 follow warming, and more importantly, quite often, when the temperature begins falling, the CO2 levels may well be continuing to rise for a while, then begin falling later.  If CO2 controlled temperature, as the Climate Scientists believe, increasing CO2 would **prevent** the temperature fall while CO2 is continuing to rise.","2018-02-05 13:13:03","5","deck_hand","1747962569.2565691","green energy transition","manual"
"dts1qyk","t3_7veehb","7veehb","climatechange","action-oriented","We aren't even close to considering eliminating fossil fuels. Optimistically, we can eliminate fossil fuels by 2050-2060, and we will still require large scale carbon capture and storage to limit climate change to below 2°C. This would require ~11% reduction in fossil fuel use year/year by 2035. Considering the direct relationship between energy use and GDP, this means there's a high chance we will need to have long term economic contraction as well.

"dtsah2w","t3_7veehb","7veehb","climatechange","action-oriented","It's already is an issue. It isn't disrupting human food production or infrastructure yet but it very likely will will before the end of the century. The question isn't whether we'll eventually transition over to renewable sources of energy. It's whether we'll do it in time to avoid more warming than our ecosystem can handle without major disruption. 

Most people see headlines about 'the world's largest wind farm' or 'a technological breakthrough' or 'the dropping costs of renewables' and think that we're making serious progress. The reality is we're so far from the finish line that we don't even know what it looks like. For every solar or wind farm' installed there is another natural gas or oil plant being built. I'd bet that in a couple decades we'll be a lot further along than we are now. But unless we decide to make it a major priority over short-term economic profit we're unlikely to see a complete replacement of fossil fuels in terms of grid power and land transportation (maritime shipping is a whole other deal) before 2100.

Advances in green energy are significant but that alone is not going to be enough to delay the effects of climate change that we are already seeing today.

Here in the UK, electricity prices have risen significantly due to a green levy to subsidise green energy projects. 

Electricity is most expensive in Denmark and Germany, two of the countries that have invested most heavily in wind turbines etc.

"du166r2","t3_7veehb","7veehb","climatechange","action-oriented","On a purely technological outlook, there's no reason why advancement won't also mean fossil fuels getting cheaper in tandem. In terms of extraction, discovery, refining etc. For example, see the recent shale gas revolution. One near-certainty about the future is that energy demand will increase. Currently, renewables are not even covering half the growth in energy demand, let alone reducing fossil fuels. Much of renewables growth to date has been through hydro and biofuels, which have obvious limitations for scaling up. For solar and wind, we need to consider that what we've done so far has involved picking the low hanging fruit in terms of installations.

In any case, there is a realistic commonly-used climate change scenario similar to what you describe called RCP4.5. The basic consequence, as shown [here](https://limitsofplanet.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rcp-scenario-projs.jpg), is still about 2degC further warming over the next hundred years.","2018-02-10 12:32:20","1","skeeezoid","1747962569.2707121","green energy transition","manual"
