I have a good idea how they work, converting CO and HC into CO2 and H20, and some of the three or four way converters can convert NOx into less harmful oxides.  I have a couple questions related to combustion engines.

* Is there a practical way for there to be a converter of some sort put on exhaust stacks for power plants, or potentially a converter on a jet engine, cruise ships, and container ships?  The automotive industry in the US has pretty strict emissions standards, where the aviation and maritime industry does not.

* Is there a way for these converters to eliminate CO and CO2 from exiting the exhaust of combustion in a car, power plant, or cargo/container ships so we eliminate those as sources for CO2 completely?  Is it possible for a converter to capture or convert all the CO2 from a combustion engine?

* Is there a way through chemistry that we can use an additive in gasoline, diesel, Jet A, Jet A-1, or heavy fuel oil to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted by burning these fuels?  What if there was a chemical process that took place in the combustion chamber that eliminated CO2?
