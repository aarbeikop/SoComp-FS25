Maybe all the soil used by industrial farming, but not the soil that has been remediated through these practices.  (Unless the increased CO2 will cause spontaneous death of all soil-building bacteria, which honestly wouldn't shock me to learn at this point.)

I think the best option is to start living like industrial society is over, devote all our resources to local food security and retrofitting our dwellings so that once the general population starts reading the writing on the walls there are structures for them to plug into, systems for them to copy.  

If sustainable community living proves impossible given the scale of climate change, at least those people would have had the spiritual experience of putting their hands in the soil while it was still alive and not merely a bunch of rock dust.

Food will become scarce due to declining bee population, leading to the need for additional labor or infrastructure which will simply jack up the price of edible goods across the board since most of our agriculture is used to feed our livestock.

Livestock die-offs will be related to more extreme heatwaves and cold snaps we see now, again increasing the cost of food

Now this is where rich people might start to notice.. but by this point it's far too late.

Politicians can ignore just about anything until it writes a manifesto or interferes with their steak dinner.  Hence why nature has been overlooked by our mostly incompetent governmental bodies around the world.

We have a future. At the very worst possible scenario, our future is much like our past -- small adaptive populations, some mobile, some not, carving out what they can. Nothing resembling industrial civilization, of course, but industrial civilization was always fleeting. 

We've been on the planet for 300,000 years. We managed to colonize the farthest and most inhospitable parts of the world -- from the Arctic to the depths of the Sahara -- with nothing more than sticks and stones.
