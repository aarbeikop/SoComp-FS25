When convincing a skeptic, sometimes circumstantial reasoning comes across more effectively. when they hit me with arguments such as, ""it's exaggerated by left wing groups"" or ""it's all green lobbying and scare mongering"" and especially ""the science is uncertain"", I tend to reply with,

""Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests? 

You know what the biggest difference is between climate science in the 70s versus now? It's a trick question, because no major technology breakthrough has altered any of the early predictions. It was solid science back then. 

That's why Exxon Mobil started its own in house world class climate change research in the late 70s, to get a handle on the magnitude of the problem. Over the next 5 years it would go on to confirm all the worst established predictions from academic research and go beyond it. Investigative journalism revealed that they predicted very accurately what the concentration greenhouse gasses would rise to by 2020. They knew 50 years in advance we would have surpassed 400ppm by now, almost double the 'natural' level. They knew that by now the first undeniable signs of severe clays change would become apparent. It was a time when this problem could be solved with a relatively painless energy transition, avoiding the worst outcomes. 

Knowing all this, Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. 

All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism. Please do give it a read.""

We recognize that actual climate scientists are freaking out about climate change, and we understand the basic science behind it, so we accept that it's true and something to be very concerned about.

The problem is, it's the vast majority of us who aren't climate scientists who are on the front lines of trying to convince the deniers.  It's our friends, our colleagues, our family that we're trying to convince.  What's needed is a tool to help us articulate our arguments and provide proper rebuttals.

It would have to be thorough, covering every denier argument, and each counter-argument would include a super concise answer for anyone who doesn't want to get super technical, and a more descriptive answer with more detail and citations.

"erbq3o3","t3_c18wl0","c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented","Point one is not based in science, at all. The “power” that warms the Earth above the 3 Kelvin of outer space (not absolute zero) is the sun. It pushes over 1300 watts per square meter of energy into Earths system on the approximately 50% of the Earth where the sun shines.  Clouds, the surface of the oceans, ice, and the surface itself reflect some of that energy away.  Part of that energy is absorbed by the atmosphere before it ever reaches the surface. Some of that energy makes it through the atmosphere, past the clouds and is absorbed by the surface. The Earth radiates away the same amount of energy, but the radiation isn’t confined to the dark side of the planet. 

The surface radiates energy, but so does the atmosphere. All matter radiates energy based on the composition of the matter and the temperature. So, a warm atmosphere will radiate energy to space without that energy having come from the surface in the form of IR in the frequency that CO2 can capture. A GHG molecule, such as water vapor, will radiate in IR based on the temperature of that molecule, and it will cool via radiation. 

All other things being equal, more GHGs in the atmosphere must cause increased levels of IR radiation from the atmosphere, with half of that radiation going upwards and away from the surface.  The very first and most reliable test of Climate Change would be the IR brightness of the mid-troposphere. We should have a quantifiable and very easily demonstrated gauge of climate change simply by measuring the change in IR bouncing around at various levels in the atmosphere.","2019-06-16 13:04:03","3","deck_hand","1747980116.577656","green energy transition","manual"
"erbzawt","t3_c18wl0","c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented"," - The reason it's detrimental 

It's about effectively framing runaway warming as a threat to us, instead of a threat to wildlife and somewhat of an inconvenience we can engineer our way around:

""We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius

The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years. Adding another 4 degrees Celsius to the top of the natural ice age - warm age temperature cycle.

Calling it global warming doesn't reveal the the implications of the problem the way climate change does. If the mean temperature increases world wide by 2 degrees, than you should not expect the same basic conditions but slightly warmer. Instead, it means macro shifts. 

For instance a monsoon that shifts in landfall location by hundreds of miles will cause droughts where it used to land and floods where it settles. Imagine water shortages for a city like new Delhi with 20+ million people. Imagine failed crops.

Besides warming, 2 degrees will be accompanied with rising sea levels and ocean acidification. This combination of effects is how 2 degrees is projected to eradicate tropical and sub tropical such as the great barrier reef which had been around the time the giant meteor eradicated the dinosaurs and which is the size of Western Europe. Further warming with its accompanied effects may critically reduce other sea life to the extent that it can no longer be relied on to feed three coastal populations in south East Asia.

A planet doesn't need an atmosphere to be warm. The radiation a planet receives from the sun needs to be irradiated out. This is called Radiative Equilibrium.

Now, a planet doesn't emit its own visible light. But it can emit infrared. How? By having a temperature. So the more energy it gets from the sun, the hotter the planet needs to be to maintain Radiative Equilibrium. In other words, it needs to have a Planetary Equilibrium Temperature.

When a planet has an atmosphere, its surface temperature is higher than the theoretical Planetary Equilibrium Temperature. Venus is an extreme example of this. It's because greenhouse gases block infrared, so the planet has to be hotter to maintain Radiative Equilibrium.","2019-06-17 03:06:18","2","j-solorzano","1747980116.584348","green energy transition","manual"

3. A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

4. We do see it in first world countries! The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.","2019-06-16 12:32:02","1","Macralicious","1747980116.586951","green energy transition","manual"

"erlc1be","t3_c2lf8p","c2lf8p","collapse","skeptical","Fantastic post. Thanks for taking the time. :) 

This is, by and large, a great summary of many of the central tenets of collapse, in my opinion. 

I generally agree with your assessment(s). I tend to lean towards thinking that collapse will be gradual and varied until _some event_ which itself may not be spectacular, that just pushes the whole system over an irrecoverable threshold. The proverbial ""straw that broke the camel's back"". The ""camel"" now is burdened with the many things you've brought up, and is staggering. 

Perhaps part of the cultural milieu we find ourselves in where we are all addled with anxiety, is due to the fact that we all _sort of_ recognize that we are not in a good and stable point in our society's history. 

I see the biggest _immediate_ issue being the ways in which people respond to gradual decreases, and then retreating quality-of-life measures. Food continues to be more expensive. It's too hot in the summer, and too cold in the winter in many places, and that will only get worse. All forms of life maintenance become too expensive as everything we do is energy-dependent (e.g. gasoline, telecom, computing, shipping, manufacturing, HVAC, etc.), so individual people's lives get more and more dismal, at least, according to _how they felt in the past_. Humans dislike _losing ground_; that's part of the reason I think the American Dream is such an intoxicating concept for people. 

To be able to work hard and make it out of poverty, and maybe even join the ranks of the wealthy, is one of the most potent memes we've ever disseminated. Many cultures currently in effect now do not share this kind of paradigm. 

However, for _everyone_ to do that, we would need an ever-expanding set of resources and energy, because for those of us who have ""arrived"" at even a ""low-class"" lifestyle in the West, is impossible for us to provide to everyone. Nobody likes relative deprivation, either. Right now, we are enmeshed in hateful, mutually antagonistic identity politics, which I imagine, in large part, exist because we feel inequalities and are doing our best to ""get what's ours"" in groups delineated via ideological markers and characteristics. It's scapegoating, pure and simple, and **such a dangerous distraction** from much larger problems which could rock our very existence. Life's existence. 

Meanwhile, the Right hates the Left, everyone is dogpiling into the LGBTPQABCDEFG++ pile, which only seems to be excluding straight, white, wealthy males, everyone hates the West, we still don't know if Russia is a boogeyman or a failed state, or something in between, and there are more ""reasons"" than ever to hate your neighbour. Just don't tell them that on goog-book or twit-stagram, or you'll get arrested for ""hate speech"". We should all be kinder to each other, but again, these are tertiary issues. The problems of the world are not caused by ""hate"", but by the conditions that lead to the genesis of that feeling. 

If we were all fabulously wealthy, nobody anywhere had to work, and we were living lives of lavish luxury, all 7.x billion of us, I suspect there would be much less social conflict. But, of course, that is beyond fanciful. So, the cold hard truth is that we have less than we need for everyone now to live even basic lifestyles. Billions already starve. Most countries do not even have potable water or reliable electricity. It's not ""whiteness"" or ""straightness"" that got us here. It was billions of mouths and assholes burning oil, eating stuff, and shitting piles of plastic everywhere. 

Many people get as far as lambasting ""meat eaters"" or ""people who have kids"" or ""people who fly"", but it is really not useful to point those fingers. We cannot all live to the minimum-standard of being in a well-made 300 sq. ft., apartment in a place with a habitable environment and HVAC when it is nasty out, eat 2,200 calories of vegan food, have a cell phone, and work as insurance adjusters who take the train downtown in a non-violent society, drink coffee, and wear clothes. The future of human existence looks basically like Mad Max, or Star Trek, and I'd bet money on the former. 

There were limits on a _healthy planet's_ ability to provide for _hunter gatherers_. There were not 8 billion of us back 50,000 years ago for a number of reasons, but the primary one is likely that without _access to energy beyond our own body's muscle power fueled by food_, we cannot exist with these population levels. Not even close. Fossil fuels account for the materiel and resource-matrix that enables for the infrastructure which in turn, essentially allows all of us to exist, and that's on a planet with a **flourishing ecosystem**. 

I see social unrest that explodes into outright conflict being the largest single wildcard, because _basically anything_ could set it off. The conditions have been developing for some time. Anything you brought up could do it. Pandemics. Armed conflict. Nuclear war. ""Terrorism"". Fiat/banking/stock failures. Ethnic tensions. Religious tensions. Water shortages. Food shortages. Cancer caused by pollution. Depression and suicide epidemics. Propaganda and outright lies. Some bored general sick of waiting for ""the day"". Military takeovers. This could be a very long list. 

I think it will not be the **absolute** collapse of the environment that causes society to collapse. I think **small**, localized but systemically-linked issues (e.g. floods, droughts, storms) will just build up to a point where society in that region becomes impossible, and the social collapse is what cascades across the planet. It might be stopped at a particularly militant border, here and there, but for the most part, I see it going down like that. I think you may be right when you say that a local region may collapse and bounce back, but that is much easier for the collapsed area if allies have not collapsed yet. To rebuild one medium-sized city even, would take decades, and resources ""worth"" trillions. If, say, Florida sank over the next five years, it's possible that the rest of the US would help those people somehow and the entire US would be OK. But, what if California, Texas, Florida, the whole South, and New York all simultaneously had a major event? Maybe. If you add more states to the ""not OK"" list though, there's a point where North Dakota cannot, by itself, do enough. 

If Germany fell now to starvation, the EU could probably help. If Italy was the only EU power left with running water and electricity, good luck. 

Ultimately, if Dr. McPherson's assessment is even half-correct, 4xx nuclear power plants being left unattended, or massive sea level rise, or the many self-reinforcing feedback loops being triggered would ultimately take what is a habitable environment for life, including ours, but I think we would have killed each other, starved, died from elemental exposure, or otherwise fallen ill because of a collapsing society, long before the raw force of mother nature comes in and wipes the slate clean for a few dozen million years.

As one post I saw here earlier today pointed out, the Colossus computer at Bletchley Park could be assembled, programmed, and fully understood by a single person.  By the time a Commodore could be bought, that was not at all practical and perhaps not really possible.  Now...well, try designing a modern chipset, writing an operating system, and building a modern computer from scratch yourself.  You could not possibly do those things, not yourself - you would need an army of engineers, technicians, and so forth.  That same model applies to so many things in our (collective, global) agricultural, food distribution/storage, transportation, energy, etc. systems that I think most people overestimate what it would take for a hard collapse.

Say for example that there is a limited nuclear exchange and the two sides destroy each other's 25 largest cities.  Do you think any country could withstand that sort of loss?  Given the hopelessly complex integration of so many systems at national, regional, and global scales, with so many resources already expended simply building us out to this point, how could they hope to recover anything close to what existed the day before such a war?  Now, layer onto that the current population of any two nuclear capable countries, subtracting perhaps 25 percent lost in the war.  In the US, that would leave Memphis, Oklahoma City, and Las Vegas as our largest remaining cities, trying to suddenly fill the void left by the loss of places like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C , Atlanta, etc.  I doubt we rebuild much of anything complex in a scenario like that.  Same goes for any other country with nukes or that can build them quickly.

Now layer onto that a rapidly warming climate that has significant further warming and climatological destabilization already built into the coming decades by prior emissions, an already thoroughly depleted oceanic biomass, an already depleted set of ecosystem services (such as crop pollination), etc.  That very first winter without a functioning natural gas delivery system or electrical system would see massive deforestation by survivors wanting to not freeze and to have warm food.  Sure, a place like North Dakota in that scenario could elect to hoard the oil and gas and grain it produces, but with a sudden loss of entire trade networks and no functional distribution network those things lose value beyond their immediate local utility.  With no meaningful way to extract willing labor from people to extract or grow that stuff beyond the needs of their immediate families, good luck keeping those resources flowing.  There are so many more interconnected systems is the point; we're not fixing them after a catastrophic event, and whatever comes after will be a lot simpler.  I imagine the 1880s with a lot less of everything we need and far more people.
