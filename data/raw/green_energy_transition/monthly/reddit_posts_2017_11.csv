Toronto based company Reboot Solar Inc. is applauding the new program as a way for clean energy incentives to be more accessible for Ontarians.
The Green Ontario Fund is a new not-for-profit provincial agency that will deliver programs and rebates to help reduce energy costs in homes and businesses. The incentives for solar are expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2018. 
The Green Ontario Fund will be administered under Ontario’s Climate Change Action Plan, funded by proceeds from the province’s new cap-and-trade program, which places limits on the amount of pollutants that companies can emit. The province held its second cap-and-trade auction in June. It raised C$504 million ($398.9 million), with total revenues from the program expected to reach C$1.8 billion this year.
“We are excited for what the future holds for solar in Ontario. We are transitioning to a more renewable Province, and the Green Ontario Fund will help to make clean tech more accessible for homeowners,” said Michael Lee, co- founder of Reboot Solar Inc.
Reboot Solar Inc is a Toronto based residential solar panel brokerage which was founded in 2016. To date, they have helped over 300 homes get installed with solar panels through the IESO MicroFIT program. Their goal is to provide flexible options to homeowners considering going solar.

**Mind Farts** - The answer is blowing in my wind

How to blow your mind, if we continue our energy growth up for 15,000 years, we will demand more energy than the sun does. If we put all our data onto dvds and stack them they will reach the moon, then in 15 years they'll reach Mars, then 2 days after that, they'll reach Saturn. We do not have enough exotic erotic minerals to achieve green data escape velocity, if we keep amassing preference data for services, we won't have enough for a successful energy transition. 

The non-linear growth in erotic elements guarantees systemic failure on increasingly shorter time lines going forward. Rare earth projections and supplies are unsustainable. Recycling and substituting elements is failing.  Most scientific breakthroughs won't scale up or hit energy barrier break even points before escape velocity.

When people say solar and wind power now run 20% of the world's electricity, they make you think there's only 80% to go. What they don't tell you is that all the world's electricity is only 30% of all the energy we use. After 20 years of subsidies, solar and wind only produce 1% of total world energy use. 

Not only are policymakers lying about our green energy future, they are lying about our green energy present. For example, saying wind turbines produce 50% of their average power 40% of the time really means that wind turbines only produce 90% of their total output 25% of the time. 

This means for every 600 Gigawatt coal plant we close, we need 6,000 Gigawatts of solar and wind to replace it. Canada and the US are huge, places like South Korea don't even have enough land for 100% solar/wind/algae power. Just to provide world energy demand with 30% algae power means we would need enough land the size of Argentina. For example.

Turning Carbon Dioxide Into Fuel and Useful Chemicals https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171127173225.htm | This process requires lanthanum. How much do we have? Can we afford that much? See? These are basic household questions any common sense person would ask. They are not answered because no one knows. The complexity bullshit doubles down when researchers say we can use any by-product waste as fuel.

Here's another example. In this video we got a climate scientist scaring the pants off you for 10 minutes, then he says a whole bunch of feel-good stuff about green energy that deep down, he knows is bullshit because we can't accept even the notion of failure. This is not his fault. It's the media's fault. They don't tell the truth. They lie. This climate scientist clearly believes what energy scientists appear to say in the media. He likely has kids, etc.

"7ggykd","sustainability","action-oriented","Thoughts on Sustainability","Hello everyone, I am a community college student and I would like to share my thoughts on the idea of living sustainably.

You see, this fall semester, I was a part of a class called Introduction to Sustainability. It is everything relating to living resource-efficiently, both globally and locally. It was a new subject, and it came with a new format. It was a student-led class. We came up with our syllabus and planned what we were going to do. The whole thing was new. At the time, I had no real interest in the subject; I was only taking to class to fill up an elective. At least half-way through the semester, I started to think a tiny bit differently. I did not commit to any huge changes, but rather, I paid more attention to some more bite-size solutions. 

Both in and out of class, what we learned reminded me that even though the problems facing our earth’s sustainability are large and gloomy, we could still do something. I remembered listening to one of our guest speakers, a government worker whose life motto was to live sustainably. Meeting someone like him was surprising and quite interesting. I liked the idea of living that nobly and kindly. Sure, not everyone can be like that. We are all born and raised into our own little niche (or maybe not so niche) social circles. Nevertheless, maybe the solution is not for everyone to go hardcore sustainable anyway. That probably is not even economically and socially feasible. 

We like to learn, and buy, and do. If we could look out for ways to live healthier, save energy, and be more aware of our environmental impact in some of the ways we act, it could do us well. Throughout this long semester, I have realized that much. 

I have included a few links to sites that outline some solutions to being semi, or at the very least, minimally sustainable. Some are simple, like shopping more green or being minimalistic (while others are a little more extreme).
