For every ton of copper fossil energy uses to make a megawatt of electricity, a wind turbine uses 500 X that amount, if you put wind turbines out to sea, they use 1,000 X that amount. But how long will copper last with all the new demand. Short answer, not long. Ugo Bardi thinks sometime between 2030-2040.

In 2010, the 15 largest copper mines processed ore that contained 1.5% copper. That means if you dig, crush and process 1 ton of rock you got 30 lbs. of copper.

In 2016, that ore grade 0.7%. One ton of ore got you 3.5 pounds of copper. 

We are approaching peak copper, and we are exponentially accelerating towards the Seneca Cliff of copper demand. Copper is unique on earth. It's the best conductor. Nothing can really and honestly replace it.

If you look at copper reserves for future projects, the ore grade is 0.35%. One ton of rock got you under 2 lbs of copper. People are so hot for copper, they can't stop touching themselves. Last year, copper outperformed gold. 

What this means is that we have to use more and more fossil fuels to get less and less copper going forward. This is the very definition of unsustainable. Just on copper alone, green energy is unsustainable for a world wide transition to 100% renewable energy.

Once we pass peak copper, no amount of money can bring enough online fast enough so shortages and price spikes ensue.

The only substitute we got for copper is aluminum, but it's too brittle and fire prone, not to mention expensive.

The reason for all this copper craze is because electric cars. We are sold the crazy bullshit notion that electric cars are good for the earth. Electric cars use a lot more and different metals and minerals. A gas tank is empty, batteries are made heavy with iron and nickel, with just an added hint of lithium. You can play with the ratios somewhat, but that makes little difference. 

The big car companies want to sell 30 million units by 2025, and they can barely secure the huge mining contracts they need to do it. There are 750 million cars on earth right now. Cars only account for 10% of human emissions. If electric cars produced 0% emissions, then 30 million vehicles would reduce human emissions 0.5%, but electric vehicles don't produce 0% emissions, they will in effect be charged using methane gas, because solar and wind power require fossil fuel backups to run continuously. But the fun, doesn't stop there, no siree. We want self driving electric cars so that we can drunk sext while stuck in traffic.

The average car today directly and indirectly is responsible for 1.5 gigabytes of online data traffic per day. By 2025, cars will be responsible for about 1.5 gigabytes of data traffic per minute. All this data traffic will be handled by 5G transponders that will be located every 100 feet or so along the side of the roads, because self-driving cars can't actually drive themselves, they need guidance. All these support devices will require metals and mineral throughputs, thus increasing the demand for copper even further. Don't even get me started how much copper the iCub child robot will use.

The Paris agreement is not enough to stop 2 C. In fact we have to reduce emissions a further 25% by 2030 than we promised in Paris to even have a chance of staying below 2 C. The year 2030 is only 12 years away. 

Electric cars will have absolutely no impact on the climate whatsoever, but it will devastate places like the Congo, where some of the biggest copper mines in the world are. The slaves who mine for cobalt in the Congo are children. So instead of saying that cobalt comes from the sweat and toil of black child slaves, we call cobalt mining in the Congo, now get this, ""artisanal mining"", like as if it were done by little faeries.

But not only do we want self-driving electric cars that do nothing for the environment, except rape the earth, we want to build billions of tons of batteries for our renewable energy systems. Investment analysts wet their pants talking about battery metals mining. After a brief investment presentation of mining stocks, they always look like they need a cigarette, which for you young people is something old people used to do after sex. It's an old people's joke, ha ha. 2 links to follow.

Germany wants 63% of their electric grid power to be renewable by then.

Germany refuses to let people know that electric grid production is only like 20% of their total energy demand.

50% of their renewable energy comes from burning wood pellets they import from all over the world. 

They want all this renewable energy so they can export cars.

Their diesel cars burn palm and soy oils.

- 15 times more concrete

- 50 times more glass. 

Wind and solar energy only provide 2% of total global demand.

http://www.climatecentral.org/news/renewable-energy-needs-huge-mineral-supply-16682http://www.climatecentral.org/news/renewable-energy-needs-huge-mineral-supply-16682

Solar energy uses much more aluminum than fossil energy. It uses as much as 1 gram/ kilowatt hour. Iron, nickel, aluminum and copper are the top fossil energy emitters. Wind power requires 10 times as much nickel as we use now if we want 100% renewable electricity. But, don't forget, 100% renewable electricity only makes up 20% of the world's total energy demand. Which means we would need something like 50 times more nickel again, if we converted 100% of total world energy demand to renewables. Check for yourself.

(source) **Renewable Energy's Hidden Costs**

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewable-energys-hidden-costs/

But since wind and solar are intermittent, we would need 10 their rated power output to close one equivalent. It takes 10 Gigawatts of solar and wind power to close one gigawatt of natural gas.

To help offset this, we need billions of tons of batteries. 

These batteries require tons of graphite, cobalt, nickel and lithium. 

Graphite mining is so dirty, it's only done in China. In 2008, they shut down several graphite mines to lower air pollution just for the Oplympics. Graphite dust is a fine silvery sparkling dust that covers everything. It gets in the water, covers the leaves and crops. The reason it's done in China is because human life is cheap there.

Graphite can be made, but costs tons more. Cobalt can also be mined as a byproduct of copper and nickel mining. Rare Earth Elements, what I call erotic minerals, are not mined alone but are also the byproduct of other base metal mining operations. The byproduct output is a small fraction of the base metal output. In other words, you need to move a lot of base metals to get very little erotic minerals. And what better place to sell heavy metals than in electric cars? You cannot mine erotic minerals unless you can sell all the base metals that go with it. You have to sell more steel, aluminum and nickel to get the exotic minerals a hi-tech world demands. 

People try to sell you Green Growth. The idea that we can grow into a globalized green economy of economic justice. They try to make you think all the slaves in China are going to sit on their asses collecting a Universal Basic Income while a new army of robots mine minerals and make cars. This model is so stupefyingly idiotic, it is only sold in liberal arts and climate science classes where students think life is a set of menu choices you either like or mute.

"7qjijg","collapse","skeptical","Shithole Countries And Green Energy","Lithium, cobalt, graphite, magnesium, nickel, copper are the new black gold.

Prospects for these minerals are strongest in Australia, Afghanistan and North Korea. 

Saudi Arabia is another shithole country filled with maniacal billionaires who are watching their oil wealth disappear.

This is why there is so much turm**oil** there at present. This is **not** unimportant.

If you draw a circle around the intersection where Bolivia, Chile and Argentina meet, you will cover the main source of the world's lithium.

This intersection is a dry mountainous desert. Water is a must for lithium production up there and the water is disappearing, and pumping water up a mountain is not cheap.

The US is a shithole country that exports death and destruction world wide while giving lip service to identity politics to destract us.

Europe is a shithole country that literally burns palm oil in diesel cars and gets 50% of its ""renewable energy"" by burning imported trees disguised a wood pellets.

Canada is a shithole country that wants to export earth killing oil sands.

My mind is a shithole country because of my tenuous grasp of facts and figures that I like to throw around like confetti at a funeral.

My mouth is a shithole country because of all the shitposts I make.

We are all shitposters because all our wailing and gnashing of teeth cannot convince people to reduce energy demand 3% per year is better than growing it 3% per year.

Even the educated white male heteros in r.collapse are shtiposters who can't even believe that AI is coming for your job. 

Libtards are just smart enough to be dangerou and contards are just stupid enough to be dangerous.

Collapse is chaos, it's not a nice tidy theory. It's erratic. Did you think just a few years ago that libs and cons would be at it worst ever?

In the US, the cons and libs form like 30% each, the other 40% is this big soft **green blob** middle. It's smooshy and soft and doesn't know what to think, or even care to.

Most people are in the middle more than they care to admit and tend to drift there over time. We are united, but not the way the libs and cons want. So they try to move us. I don't about you but I know you can't push giant mounds of green jello around. It's impossible.

The only thing that can move that amorphous blob is money. Money is the only thing on the whole planet that unites us. Everybody believes in God in some way, but we all agree on money. 

The only way to move humanity is with AI blockchain technology. When dumbasses like me think of AI, we picture robots. The problem with AI is that you can't see it, you don't see it, and you will never see it. AI is a hidden network of millions of computers hiding in plain site on our pornphones.

What's more important right now? Working hard to save earth or getting fucked? We are all shithole fucktards. Why just this morning I left a smouldering ash bucket in the porch, I just caught it and the place smells like a firehall.

The gnomes of Zurich (aka bankers) get rich because of secrecy and asymmetrical ignorance. Blockchain is just an honest ledger. Honest because it's not done by a human. Blockchain is the Ronald Reagan accounting version of **trust but verify**.

The financial bubble is soon going to pop, and you guys are going to be wondering what to do. That's why I got my shithole open spouting noxious fumes of bullshit. 

To unite humanity to save earth, we have to take James Hansen's private carbon dividends and pay them out in a new blockchain world currency. Nothing will unite Zurich's gnomes and America's rednecks more. 

Most rednecks don't understand that taxes don't have to go to the government, or to the corporations. Most of Zurich's gnomes don't understand sharing the wealth. 

I've been preaching this line of crap for nearly ten years, or something like it, ever since Hansen first proposed 100% private carbon tax dividends (with 0% share for governments and corporations). Enron was when we first learned that accountants are criminals. Enron was an energy company. This is not a coincidence. 

Collapse is the implosive Seneca Wave of complexity. The Seneca Wave is a cliff that undercuts itself, like on Road Runner cartoons. Open honest accounting books are very simple, even 1s and 0s can do it.
The driver of complexity is money. Money makes lawmakers do stupid things. The 2 things humanity needs is blockchain democracy and blockchain accounting. And if I call you a fucking faggot, all that I've said is undone.

Do you see how easy division is? That's what drives collapse.
