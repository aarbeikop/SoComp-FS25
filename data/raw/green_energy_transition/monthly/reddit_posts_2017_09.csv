“Water security is one of the most tangible and fastest growing social, political and economic challenge faced today.”
World Economic Forum (2016)


1. Water Risks is an Increasing Concern 
By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. It will be 11 billion by 2100. All these people will need water to meet their most basic needs. Agriculture, industry and domestic life rely on the abundant supply of safe water. However, this is by no means guaranteed and unpredictable water quality and availability represent one of the decade’s top emerging risks. 
Freshwater risk management is complex to assess. Such difficulty stems from the paradoxical nature of water: it is plentiful to many yet its scarcity affects hundreds of millions of people, it is both fossil and renewable, it is freely supplied by nature but its treatment, distribution, and wastage have a cost. 
Water risks are often underestimated, disregarded or simply ignored. This results in a global lack of preparation for future impacts and has implications for the world’s population, as a majority of water risks represent externalities which are not properly assessed. Consequently, all research and reports identified future concerns, especially in the following areas: 
■ World population will have to respond to a growing frequency and severity of losses; 
■ Awareness levels could be improved and drinking water will have a role in increasing understanding; 
■ The World need significant innovation in drinking water by directing big investments into innovative projects, technologies, and asset lines. 
■ The difficulty to assess future water risks is emphasized by the advent of new technologies and big infrastructure projects the eventual effects of which are as yet unclear.


2. What Are the Risks? 
A number of water risks are considered in this paper, including the impact of scarcity, pollution, water-related illnesses, treatment and topics of social, political and economic interests. 
Natural resources are unequally distributed around the world. Physical water scarcity, or the literal lack of water, is gradually worsening in many areas. Economic water scarcity from lack of finance or inadequate water management will lead to the rapid depletion of usable water resources. Such shortages will inevitably have implications for a wide range of insurance lines of business: property, agriculture, casualty, life, and health.
Ensuring clean water supply is a key to socioeconomic development. A failure to deliver or maintain a clean water supply can be inhibiting for any society. Many emerging countries are less capable of treating their water due to insufficient economic means. Water treatment in developed countries is subject to increasingly stringent regulations and quality standards to address pollution. Furthermore, treatment plants are considered as critical infrastructure that can potentially disseminate toxic products on a large scale as a result of human error or terrorist attack. Such a large scale event in a major city could seriously impact the world’s population.


3. Water is plentiful on earth, yet scarcity affects hundreds of million people worldwide.
Only 3% of global water resources are in the form of freshwater (in glaciers, ice caps, groundwater, lakes, soils, rivers, atmosphere and within living organisms); 97% is salt water in the oceans. Humanity does not lack water as such but faces shortages of fresh water readily available for consumption. This is aggravated by uneven geographical distribution, erratic supplies, and evolving trends in worldwide water patterns. 

4. Water resources: both fossil and renewable
Water moves continuously between different reservoirs, following a natural hydrological cycle. The turnaround time of water is about 10 days in the atmosphere and a few weeks in rivers, which makes it effectively renewable. On the contrary, water replacement in deep aquifers can last for hundreds to thousands of years: it is a non-renewable fossil resource (like oil) when withdrawals exceed the annual recharge. The increasing human demand gradually takes its toll on fossil water, some resources are already depleted at rates far superior to their replacement times. 

5. Water is free, but treatment, distribution, and mismanagement have a cost
Access to water from rivers, wells or dedicated infrastructures is generally free but this water is often unsafe if untreated. On a larger scale, industries, services, and agricultural structures rely on water as a cheap and abundant resource. Yet they often operate without a clear consciousness of the impact of their individual operations on the environment and on other users. A largely unsuspected price (“the true price of water”) includes treatment and distribution and extends to the cost of leakages, evaporation, contaminations, inefficient usage and wasteful practices. 

6. Water brings life, yet it can kill
 
Since it sheltered the emergence of life 4 billion years ago, it has been irreplaceable for humans’ survival and basic needs (drinking, food, sanitation, and dignity). But unsafe waters impact public health through contamination and spread of infectious diseases. 

7. Water: a public or a private asset?
Even though water supply is a key political issue for every government and community, it is often treated and distributed by major corporate companies whose objective is profit. The decision on water management is always a local compromise between the various stakeholders and the society as a whole. 

8. Water is a global issue, yet management is local
Water is at the same time a shared asset and a common cause of risk. It is usable countless times by different actors in different locations, provided that those usages do not impact on its quality or availability for the next user. But unless mutual coordination and respect of others are upheld, sharing water may trigger liabilities and conflicts.

9. Water projects generate development but may induce concerns 
Water supports the dynamics of human societies. Major cultures and civilizations developed in direct proximity to water sources. Good water management greatly enhanced the growth of communities. New technologies are still being introduced to master water resources: desalination plants, water recycling, nanotechnologies.

10. Origins of Water Scarcity and Expected Developments 

Water scarcity originates from the deficiency in water availability to meet the different users’ needs and can take different forms: usage exceeding resources, limited access to resources due to the lack of infrastructure, to inadequate sanitation or to pollution. Water scarcity results from a complex interplay of multiple factors. The physical absence of water is the most obvious cause, but poor water management and anthropic causes are contributing to a greater and greater extent.

 11. Type of water resources 

Different types of renewable water resources need to be distinguished:
- Blue water is the part of rainfall going directly to rivers by runoff or infiltrating into the ground to feed the aquifers and it is a major renewable water resource. 
- Green water is the part of rainfall temporarily stored into the upper soil layer, and taken back to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration of vegetation and it is another major renewable water resource. 
- Ice, by melting and it is renewable if new snow compensates each year for the melted part. 
- Apart from these renewable water resources, Fossil water stored in aquifers is non-sustainable ‘blue-water’ groundwater stocks are increasingly tapped into and will eventually run out. 


12. New technologies and Innovations 

As the need for water treatment is growing, new technologies are being developed. Desalination is an emerging process increasingly used. It is more energy intensive than traditional water treatments and, because of its cost,
 is only adapted for dry regions. Large projects are developing in the Middle East, in the US, Australia, and Europe 
Other alternatives aim at reducing the environmental impact of water treatment.
Treating large quantities of reused water to make it drinkable again would require enormous amounts of energy: 
for that reason and for cultural ones – event treated, some people have trouble accepting the fact that they are drinking wastewater – it is still not acceptable at an industrial scale. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.

13. True cost of water 

The true cost of water is a key starting point. It looks beyond just the price of the cubic meter as it encompasses also monetization of water related risks having already materialized for cities and industries while looking as well as indirect costs and missed opportunities. 
Indeed assessing the true cost of water is not straightforward and includes several aspects: 
1. Direct costs: Water price, cost of treatment plants and of other infrastructures. In Europe the price of potable water to the public varies from 1€/m3 (Italy) to 6.4€/m3 (Denmark). The water resources available and the state subsidies vary from one country to another. 
2. Indirect costs: Such as cost of public relations, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), lawyers, fines. 
3. Risks impacts: Such as remediation costs and downtime in case of pollution, drought, flooding. 
4. Missed opportunities: Positive impact of good water management in terms of investors’ attractiveness and opportunities in creating new revenue streams by selling treated wastewater to third parties for reuse. It includes as well new financial opportunities to capture, such as negotiating better insurance premium when mitigating risks and enhancing resilience & robustness.

14. The World need innovative approaches and solutions 

•Technological solutions 
•Smart investments 
•Integration with other functions 
•Instead of reïnventing the wheel, let’s learn from nature 

15. Blue Planet, Scarce Water 

We live on a watery planet, but less than 1% of all that freshwater is available for ecosystems and human use in
rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Yet, these life-giving freshwater systems face a host of threats from over-abstraction, 
fragmentation, pollution, climate change, and the ever-increasing demands of a growing population. 

16. Water for Drinking 

Healthy freshwater systems provide drinking water. In fact, while we need only drink 3-5 liters per day to 
remain healthy, the food we eat, clothes we wear, the energy we consume and products we use daily 
take tens of thousands of liters to produce.
A systemic and cross-sectoral ‘urban ecosystem’ approach is needed to design and implement
solutions to the multifaceted challenges. The main objective of this priority is to help design, implement and upscale
place-based and people-based transition pathways towards resilient, sustainable, low-carbon and resource efficient urban area.


17. Next step

We need to launch our eWATER solution to raise international awareness about the importance of water and identify strategies to raise the awareness of our clients and consumers. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.


18. eWATER solution - revolution

We at Zero Carbon a smart water tech startup, are dedicated to environmental preservation by developing and deploying societal and disruptive technologies. Our mission is very ambitious – we want to provide safe and clean drinking water to all world population every day, anytime and anywhere. Without any extra infrastructure at an affordable cost.

Picture this, a water ATM in the middle of the busy city, on a busy street that produces the purest, high-quality pure drinking water available today. Out of air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also beneficial to your health. Our consumers pay per use with coins, mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract.
We can supply world population with most important substances on earth the drinking water. 




 “Without major technological innovations there is little hope of bringing the water equation into balance. There is no doubt that many technological changes can help improve services for millions and reduce the stress on water systems around the world.”
                                                                                                                   The World Water Council 



How it works
eWATER is a pay per- use drinking water refill ATM system. As the name implies, is a sort of a water vending machine except that in a water is produced out of the air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also available on demand 24/7 all year around. 
Our consumers pay per use of drinking water before refill bottle they have. 

They pay with coins, use mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract. Payment goes into the machine in return for water. 

These machines are built, owned and operated by ZERO CARBON. The water ATM is providing safe and clean drinking water every day, anytime and anywhere. 

This concept will totally reduce the financial burden of the government cost of the water infrastructure. 

We will provide drinking water to people in the range of 10-20 cent euro (€0.10 – 0.20) per 1 liter on a pilot basis.

eWATER ATMs have the following advantages for consumers:
•	24 x 7 provision 
•	Water quality accountability and control
•	Pay-per-use methodology
•	Price transparency and flexible purchase
•	No Water Shortage
•	Eliminate overuse of PET bottles
 They also benefit project stakeholders as follows:
•	Off-grid functionality and environment-friendly
•	Low O&M requirement ensure water fee is affordable
•	Information layering (through cloud connectivity) for accountability (tracking each user transaction)
•	Service optimisation by monitoring key process parameters real-time online
•	Adaptable to various location types (streets, outdoor community spaces, school, hospital, etc.
•	Potential for targeted subsidies
•	Increases social impact
