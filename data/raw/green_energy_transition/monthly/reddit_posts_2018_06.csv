Coal Ash Is More Radioactive Than Nuclear Waste - Scientific American

Increased solar radiation will boil oceans

https://climatenewsnetwork.net/emissions-could-make-earth-uninhabitable/

Note: More lethal space radiation is hitting earth, and more will do so soon because of 2 reasons; 1) weakening magnetic field, 2) ozone destruction due to increased volcanic and human activity.

This increased space radiation separates the increased water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, since hydrogen is the lightest element, it drifts off into space, and without hydrogen there's no water.

Water vapor itself has become a climate feedback loop. Increased upper atmospheric water vapor and radiation can accelerate planetary ocean loss.

Vaclav Smil says energy transitions take at least 70 years, if ever, to happen.

When people got sick of coal power and smoggy cars, the government promised that hydro power would replace coal, which it did NOT, instead it just added to the power use, so coal kept growing right along with hydro. This is exactly what is happening with renewable power and fossil fuels now.

We transitioned from wood to coal a few hundred years ago, and many still burn wood to this day, because dead wood is free in the jungle.

We got 20 years to get emissions BELOW ZERO for eternity, or hit 2 C.

To do that we have to first reduce emissions 100% in 20 years.

It takes 50 years to change world energy demand 100% worldwide.

That's because worldwide means like all over the whole fucking world.

The plant waste we burn is food for the soil and trees, not green energy for us to steal.

We are changing earth 100X faster than whatever killed the dinosaurs.

We are going to run out of food and water before we get 50% renewable energy worldwide.
