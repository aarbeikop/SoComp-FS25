Carbon Engineering and a group of Harvard scientists have come up with a way to cheaply remove CO2 from the atmosphere, $94-$232 per ton.  With a small plant in British Columbia they've already proven they can do it.  Similar to a paper mill, the CO2 undergoes a chemical process to remove it from a carbonate solution.  Then the CO2 is combined with hydrogen and made into liquid fuels.  This would eliminate the need to continue extracting fossil fuels from the ground and create carbon-neutral fuels.

&#x200B;

Not satisfied with the Green New Deal's overly ambitious goal of 100% renewable energy and skeptical of the proposed ""market based"" solution in the House right now, I think this new technology is where we should be focusing our money and efforts.  Our lifestyles won't need to change if this works, we wont' crash the economy with burdensome fees or taxes, and we won't be running the risk of tying the EPA's hands for ten years on enacting new regulations on carbon emissions if emissions fail to meet target levels.  Though electric cars have promise, as of yet they haven't come down in price enough to be a mass market solution, and there still aren't enough charging stations.  Our country is too big and spread out to ever serve people adequately with mass transit alone.  We're a nation that needs cars.

&#x200B;

This same company may even be able to sequester CO2 in the ground, another possible way to put our tax dollars to good use.

"ahpmw6","environment","emotional","Interview & video with I'm A Celebrity Stanley Johnson On 40 Years of International Environmental Protection & Brexit","Just before Christmas I was fortunate enough to have a conversation with Stanley Johnson as part of my series of Green & Tonic Climate Rockstar’s, the full conversation can be watched [here](https://youtu.be/FMGLG11V6OU). In this timely & impactful conversation I talk to Stanley Johnson; TV reality star, veteran environmental policy maker & father to Boris Johnson. In a discussion that covers Stanley’s impressive 40 years of environmental & climate policy leadership from the creation of the UN’s Environment Programme (UNEP) and the international body of climate scientists known as the IPCC, the recent climate negotiations in Katowice Poland and inevitably examining todays all-consuming issue for the UK of Brexit.

We begin our conversation some forty+ years ago in June 1972 at the Stockholm Environmental Convention which Stanley attended as a delegate moving then to the inaugural meeting of the UNs International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in October 1986, the organisation which underpins global scientific understanding on climate change. What is so interesting through the lens of today’s political polarisation is the role that ‘right-winged’ politicians and particularly Margaret Thatcher played in these early days of international environmental policy making. Not only in driving action on issues such as the hole in the ozone layer and climate change but championing an international UN mandated approach including the creation of international institutions. There is also a fascinating insight into the then concerns of Governments that following speedy success of the Ozone Convention that the climate agenda might move too quickly. Tragically history has proven that concern found less to say the least!

Stanley talks about his 40 years of environmental policy engagement and his twenty years at the heart of the European Union’s environment policy making. Drawing on his new book to mark the 40th Anniversary of the UNs Environment Programme, [The First 40 Years; A Narrative by Stanley Johnson](https://www.scribd.com/document/126699771/UNEP-The-First-40-Years-A-Narrative-by-Stanley-Johnson))(including his years in the EU Commission and as an MEP.

It is a unique comparison of the consensus driven UN approach (in his words “the tyranny of the unanimity”) versus the more prescriptive legally enforceable approach of the European Union. Perhaps what is most interesting coming from the father of one of the Leave campaigns key proponents and Brexiteers darling, Boris Johnson, is Stanley’s observation that the UK drove and influenced much of EU environmental policy and it’s so called environmental acquis. Citing the example of how the UK’s 1974 Control of Pollution Act influenced much of the EU’s policy & regulation on the control of waste. Yet it was not always the case that the UK was driving for clean and safe outcomes as he reminds us that the UK fiercely opposed the EU’s anti-pollution emission limits that have saved so many UK lives. Much as we owe our clean beaches to EU law, we owe our much improved air quality to EU environmental policy as well.

It is also an illuminating discussion of how the UK has exercised significant soft power globally through international bodies such as the UN, IPCC magnified by our influential role within the EU.

Of course, in light of the current Brexit crisis subsuming most of the UK’s domestic agenda and the central role of his family in this domestic and international drama it is impossible for us to stay off the topic of Brexit. Stanley is one of the stars and a public treasure from his recent appearances in the reality TV shows I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here & The Real Marigold Hotel leaves us in now doubt as to his views on Brexit.

Stanley is clearly sad & concerned at the prospect that Brexit may both weaken both the UK domestic environment agenda and our international influence acting through the EU. Indeed, during the 2016 Referendum campaign like many families, the Johnsons were split in a way not seen since the split between Parliamentarians & Royalists in the 1660s.  Stanley’s son Boris was a key principal of the official leave campaign, Vote Leave, and Stanley was a key proponent behind Environmentalists for Europe (E4EU) making the case to Remain. Stanley makes no bones about the fact that he would prefer the UK to remain in the EU. Yet he went along with the Referendum result until the likely deal became clear and the fact that we would be giving up our sovereignty within the EU.

Stanley talks about what he expects will happen next and his feeling that if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is rejected by Parliament (which it just was) we will likely be heading down the road of a Peoples Vote as the only way to unlock the parliamentary log jam.

We move on to discuss that whilst the COP24 climate negotiations held in Katowice (Poland’s coal county) have delivered part of a Paris Agreement Rulebook the level of ambition falls far short of what the recent IPCC Special Report on 1.5ºC says we need to deliver a stable climate outcome. Nonetheless, Stanley is optimistic about the power of technology. He is encouraged to hear of the economic tipping point now taking place as part of the energy transition and agrees that what will likely follow this economic tipping point is a political tipping point. Stanley is sure that the work of [Carbon Tracker](https://www.carbontracker.org/reports/2020-vision-why-you-should-see-the-fossil-fuel-peak-coming/)highlighting this economic tipping point and the fact that many fossil fuel projects which clearly don’t make climate sense also don’t make financial sense is having an impact. 

We then move onto discuss what Brexit says about the UK’s political system. We discuss whether the Brexit crisis and the current political impasse is a symptom of a broken political system. Stanley seems to peg the blame squarely onto the shoulders of the first past the post system which shuts out all but the most mainstream political views & policies, clearly to the detriment of the green movement and new parties.

I conclude by asking Stanley what would he like to see in 2019. Stanley is as clear and directive as ever. He would like us to deal with the things that really matter rather than our current obsession with Brexit. He would like

1. the UK to stay in the EU; and
2. exercise a lot of dynamism to ensure the EU pushes harder on climate change, nature & forest protection;
3. If we do not remain in the EU he would like us to continue to lead from outside Europe, but is less confident of our likely impact.

Cleary Stanley has little sympathy for the Brexit arguments for taking back sovereignty and we conclude ironically that we are likely to exercise more power and sovereignty in relation to international environmental & climate change policy acting through the EU in partnership with 27 other EU partners.

"af5vrw","sustainability","action-oriented","‘Cement’ing endeavours is a must for ‘Sustainable Construction’"," 

THE term ‘Sustainable Construction’ emerges very often during usual Sustainability conversation but this key concept despite being the cornerstone for green infrastructure has not gained as much importance as it was anticipated. With fast growing urbanisation across India, the building activities have been witnessing rapid growth momentum, so does the strain on the finite natural resources.

It is true that expanding urban boundaries have also opened up better opportunities and promising future, thus further driving migration of rural communities to semi or urban cities, but at the same time the unplanned cities have been, it is a proven fact, increasingly triggering environmental degradation. The forest cover has been pruned or compromised while animals inhibited by toxic substances, vehicles and the loss of habitat and food sources…

Therefore, mounting voices all over the country have been demanding immediate corrective actions as well as implementation of more effective long-term policies in this transition to a low-carbon economy, strongly backed by the determined lawmakers as well as big corporations that wield immense money power and have their footprints in remote locations. The later can significantly influence communities around their operations. In addition, robust guidelines by the prominently recognised institutions like NITI Aayog in India as well as the United Nations and World Sustainable Development Associations in the global level will give impetus to undertake adequate remedial measures that safeguard Mother Earth from facing catastrophes like the one that caused destruction in Kerala – the biggest ever in the recent history of God’s own state.

To proactively preserve the environment from gradual degradation, a significant role is being played by the building material sector – along with other core industries – by doing whatever possible. However, this industry and its allied sectors like real estate have been criticised as among the greenhouse polluters. For instance, the country’s apex court Supreme Court has, in its recent interim order, has imposed a ban on construction activities in three biggest markets – Madhya Pradesh, Maharshtra and Uttarakhand – over the delayed framework by the state governments over solid waste management. While this has sparked much turbulence in the relevant sectors, fortunately it was lifted within days. Furthermore, recently the Delhi government too took cognisance of severe environmental impact on the national capital, partly blaming the construction activities.

The environment researchers reiterate the planet’s health will deteriorate even further unless a stronger platform for dialogue and collective action is not brought to the forefront to leverage existing capabilities, that too on a larger scope and scale. The efforts in this direction will accelerate low carbon transition at the time when the government is spending hugely in infrastructure projects – Housing for All, Smart Cities, Highways and Roads among others.

Therefore, much emphasis is given to the resilient green infrastructure that effectively addresses socioeconomic and environmental challenges by integrating holistic approaches leading to a conducive environment where economic indicators, social equity, consumption of energy and natural resources, and rapid advancements in technology thrive together. Emulating practices of global smart cities – Tokyo, Toronto, Seoul, Hong Kong, Amsterdam among others – is a good idea.

But over the years, the building material suppliers – particularly cement sector – have strictly adhered to and embodied the globally benchmarked Sustainable Practices that drove the Sustainable Construction, which has, as a result, been gaining momentum to promote and support green buildings that focused on mitigating both usage of natural resources as well as Green House Gases’ emissions. Their presence in rural and semi-urban regions owing to their nature of business has transformed the surroundings around its operations, generating livelihood and preserving the natural environment while balancing the sustained growth. In fact, India is among the countries that are on track to achieve the targets set to address climate change under the Paris Agreement.

The sector is adopting various practices to address alarming climate change issue – from innovative manufacturing processes that include optimising the extracted key ingredient limestone, advanced kiln mechanism, to energy utilisation and producing blended cement to offering value-added services including advanced concrete curing methodology and innovative rainwater harvesting solutions among others. Extending their efforts in this endeavours are the building architectures who are designing techniques including natural ventilation, double-paned windows, low-flow toilets and low-water-use landscaping etc – all enabling comfortable and improved inhabitants’ lives.

This gradual transition towards green and eco-friendly operations should be encouraged through a range of incentives, including tax breaks, or the prestigious certificates by the government. Involving a diverse set of stakeholders by the government to help improve sustainability scores while enhancing the value creation to the end users, besides enhancing awareness among all will surely deliver desired outcomes.

In conclusion, the low-carbon transition is a continuous journey. Mere implementation of the latest processes, technologies and government reforms may not completely minimise the scale and impact of climate change. However, things can be transformed gradually only by collective and sustained efforts towards climate-resilient emissions’ control strategies.

"abicrb","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2018","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for 3 years now nick-named [“Signs of collapse”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.
