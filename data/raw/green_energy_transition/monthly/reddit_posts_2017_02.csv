You can grow [70000-80000](https://books.google.nl/books?id=3kE9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=Mushrooms+kg+per+hectare&source=bl&ots=dNh47nB2_O&sig=O7NfYl5wfvd2kpnWs2nNmt9ca0Y&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5tbLhiq3PAhVbFMAKHXsnDfYQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=Mushrooms%20kg%20per%20hectare&f=false) kg of protein per hectare with mushrooms, or 80 kg of protein per hectare with beef cattle, or 650 kg per hectare with fish farming.

[Forty percent of the world's land surface is used just for meat production.](http://science.time.com/2013/12/16/the-triple-whopper-environmental-impact-of-global-meat-production/) The world has so many cattle that we don't know what to do with all the manure they produce, but it can be used to grow mushrooms. The reason it doesn't happen is because mushrooms are labor intensive to grow and the biggest cost for farmers is their personnel.

Don't like the taste of mushrooms? How about shellfish then? We can grow as much protein from shellfish [on 1 or 2% of the surface area that we now use to feed cattle.](https://books.google.nl/books?id=snnyCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=mussels+without+shell+protein+content&source=bl&ots=Px1aGqkCHF&sig=JIQ7KikClOicbuTsCY0RG5BO2cU&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBGoVChMI3bDM2dPQxwIVi_5yCh1FKwR7#v=onepage&q&f=false)

What about climate change? To eliminate all of our annual CO2 emissions from the atmosphere, we'd have to cover [9% of the ocean's surface with seaweed](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/20/climate-crisis-future-brighter-tim-flannery). The seaweed could then be used to feed fish and we could eat the seaweed directly. How difficult do you think this is? The answer is: Not very. We're already using half the world's terrestrial surface, to use 9% of the ocean's surface is hardly a challenge.

The solution are so abundant, that I grew bored of them. People who think there are no solutions out there don't understand the real problem. I'm not talking about the magical solutions of /r/futurology based on science, that allow us to increase our power and energy consumption indefinitely. I'm talking here about solutions that would allow us to avoid the very real scenarios of civil war, genocide, mass suicides, starvation and nuclear war. There's no invention out there that we have to wait for, the problem comes down to how we want to live.

We were given immense power over nature, but we failed to gain wisdom in the process. That's what went wrong. We're hardly the first culture that has gone through this problem however. [History is filled with instances of cultures that chose to die out when their way of life became unsustainable.](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jason-godesky-thirty-theses#toc53) The problem there is an underlying sickness, a cultural error. It's what Terence Mckenna referred to as the dominator culture. Modern day archeologists always struggle to believe that the vikings in Greenland genuinely died of hunger, surrounded by a sea filled with fish. Future archeologists will struggle to believe that people died of hunger, surrounded by their green lawn, that we have more empty homes than we have homeless people, or that physical space could be bought and left idle and devoid of life as an ""investment"".

When Europeans arrived in the New World, they didn't meet a pristine landscape. They met people who had different outlooks on life. This is how you could have cities in the Amazon, surrounded by a rainforest. The rainforest was not pristine, it was actively cultivated by the Americans. These cultures had evolved in a different direction. Most Amazon cultures believed in multiple paternity. The Christian missionaries who encountered these people recorded them consuming Ayahuasca brews that they referred to as the work of the devil. The direction their culture took was one that proved to be relatively easy for the newcomers to eradicate and replace with a new culture of their own, but it can hardly be considered an improvement, it's a culture that's paving the way for the South American continent to become effectively uninhabitable.

If you want to know where the real problem lies, it's not in our failure to figure out how to build fusion reactors, or how to capture and sequester carbon dioxide. An alcoholic doesn't look at his alcohol consumption as the problem, he looks at his failure to brew his own whisky as the problem. The real problem is an underlying sickness that's pervasive throughout our culture, a sickness that prevents us from genuinely relating to each other as human beings, rather than as dehumanized tools who can be manipulated with money and base their self-worth on how much they have of it. That's not the default operating mentality for humanity, it's a sickness we succumb to.

The solution is a cultural change. It has to be noted that what is believed by anthropologists to be a universal feature of the Neolithic revolution [is the transition from hallucinogenic psychoactive substance consumption that alters our perception of the world around us to the use of mood-altering and stimulative substances](http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2993/etbi-35-03-566-584.1). The people who left their forests intact, who didn't choose to live in cities and didn't implement social hierarchies, were not our intellectual inferiors, but had a different culture instead. The cultural difference itself led to a low population density that prohibited the need for the Neolithic transition, as sexually transmittable diseases and a low calorie diet had the effect of reducing women's fertility. There was no genuine fear of death either, as people experienced death itself during their entheogenic experiences. You can consider a forest with hunter-gatherers as an alternative stable state that the Earth's terrestrial surface can enter, different from that of people who believe themselves to have a divine obligation to reproduce themselves exponentially and conquer the world.

What we refer to as the collapse of civilization is more like a premature abortion of an experiment that failed. This experiment failed long before it started to collapse, as anyone who looks around at our society can figure out. When 13% of people take anti-depressants, children are drugged because they refuse to sit still in school and the type of adults we're supposed to envy sit in cubicles and spend the whole day trading abstract financial products with each other, we can hardly look at ourselves and genuinely come to the conclusion that we created a functional society. This is a form of madness. I'm amazed it's even allowed to run on for as long as it does.
