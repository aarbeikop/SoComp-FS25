Yes, all true. But you'll notice the word ""impossible"" is missing.

> every ounce of it we possess will have to meet essential needs before those of alternative energy

I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. Either you have the renewable infrastructure in place and paid for by the time you're in severe energy scarcity, or you don't. If you don't, you're quite screwed. So here's a plan already.

> To close down a 1 megawatt fossil fuel plant we require 10 megawatts of solar and wind power

You're probably talking about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor here. Specifically

Capacity factor and renewable energy[edit]

US EIA monthly capacity factors for renewables, 2011-2013
When it comes to several renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and hydroelectricity, there is a fourth reason for unused capacity. The plant may be capable of producing electricity, but its ""fuel"" (wind, sunlight or water) may not be available. A hydroelectric plant's production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for fish downstream. However, solar, wind and hydroelectric plants do have high availability factors, so when they have fuel available, they are almost always able to produce electricity.[10]

When hydroelectric plants have water available, they are also useful for load following, because of their high dispatchability. A typical hydroelectric plant's operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes.

Wind farms are variable, due to the natural variability of the wind. For a wind farm, the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind. Transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45%, though current 110 meter towers can have up to 55% capacity factor, and future 140 meter towers are expected to have up to 65% capacity factor.[11]

Solar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth, seasonal changes, and because of cloud cover. According to,[12] the Sacramento Municipal Utility District observed a 15% capacity factor in 2005. However, according to the SolarPACES programme of the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as Spain or the south-western United States,[13] although in some locations solar PV does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is zero.[14][15] SolarPACES states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of solar thermal power (CSP) stations can be extended to become dispatchable (load following).[13] The IEA CSP Technology Roadmap (2010) suggests that ""in the sunniest countries, CSP can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by 2020, and of base-load power by 2025 to 2030"".[16] A dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power.[17]

Geothermal has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources, and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. While the carrier medium for geothermal electricity (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, will be available for the foreseeable future.[18] Geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth.

> Green energy is low-density energy in that it is spread out over large geographical areas, i.e. - there is not enough land in South Korea for a 100% energy transition to solar and wind power.

And that is some choice horse pucky. 

> What this means is that the resource intensity per unit of intermittent energy production is unsustainably high.

Says who?

> Not to mention that solar and wind products have a planned obsolescent life-cycle of 30 years

Citations, please.

> Recycling their component alloys cost more than mining for them in the first place because recycling them uses more energy.

Also bullshit.

> We are set to double energy demand in 50 years

Don't see how we're going to pull that off. Instead of 17 TW primary consumption the world might have to run on some 20 TW electricity (not primary energy, electricity, these are not nominal capacities but real production).

> The energy trap is leading us into a complexity trap where the confluence of crises overwhelms human society.

The longer we wait and the longer it takes the more difficult the problem is going to be.

> most of us never knew shortages of energy and food, or even shortages of anything

The more power to those of us who have learned to deal with scarcity, then.

Next we have climate change. Scientists talk of reducing consumption without mentioning the source of consumption, and the answer is not ""us"". We didn't neurologically program ourselves with consumption culture. So, who is programming us and why? Who are these people? Of course, these people can't be stopped, but the reality is that the burden of responsibility is not on the public, which isn't capable of spontaneously understanding the problems on their own initiative, which would necessitate enough neurological reprogramming to result in a mitigating, culture-wide change, and this would have to be facilitated by a massive infrastructural coadaptation. The people controlling infrastructure and resources would never allow this, or even be capable of it.
