Also, the paper you linked is unfortunately behind a paywall (FUCK Elsevier) so there is no way for many people to follow your sources.

Here is a link to a paper that is easily accessible which refutes the EKC https://steadystate.org/wp-content/uploads/Stern_KuznetsCurve.pdf

""The evidence presented in this paper shows that the statistical analysis on which the environmental Kuznets curve is based is not robust. There is little evidence for a common inverted U-shaped pathway that countries follow as their income rises"" (pg.1435)
""‘Our review of both the theoretical and empirical work on the EKC leads us to be skeptical about the existence of a simple and predictable relationship between pollution and per capita income"" (pg.1435)

So please, do not bring the EKC into this as it is (at least very arguably) fundamentally untrue
