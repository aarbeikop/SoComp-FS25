[This](http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/europe/accelerating-the-energy-transition-cost-or-opportunity) is something you might find interesting and or useful to read. A recently released report by McKinsey about a major acceleration of the Dutch energy transition. I would say it gives a pretty comprehensive overview of what's required to change to a sustainable energy supply in The Netherlands, assuming a consumption and society don't change a lot. Still, it reads pretty easily and has some nice visualisations. ","2016-10-09 20:31:56","4","[deleted]","1747946415.8856409","green energy transition","manual"
"d8kvyc5","t3_56nt23","56nt23","sustainability","action-oriented","any math on that scenario requires assumptions and predictions about the future... meaning that the math is speculative. and who is ""we""? Is it America, is it the world, is it somewhere else? The answer to that question changes what you mean by ""today's standard of living"". I'm interested in the math, but there are first hundreds of conceptual assumptions and projections that must be made to be able to calculate anything. 

also i'm unsure of how seriously or credibly we should take you since you've used your account to ask for someone to watch you jerk off.","2016-10-09 20:34:03","3","louislinaris","1747946415.887168","green energy transition","manual"
"d8kvxlj","t3_56nt23","56nt23","sustainability","action-oriented","I think that question is far too broad.  You gotta define ""green"" and you have to define ""today's standard of living"". Most people who've thought about it think that yes, we'll do just great if we get rid of fossil fuels. It's not about sacrifice, it's about efficiency and new technology and to a lesser extent, cultural shift.","2016-10-09 20:33:35","3","scarlotti-the-blue","1747946415.888268","green energy transition","manual"

EROEI is probably the closest you'll get to satisfying your hankering for math. Even without eliminating the use of fossil fuels, fossil fuels will begin to eliminate themselves as their discovery, extraction and processing becomes a poorer investment of existing energy resources. Renewables clearly can't and will never be able to meet the energy needs of today's industrial civilization. You also have to consider how geographically self limiting renewables are, and how poorly electricity travels. I think people are hard pressed to actually present a viable future based on ""green energy"" that doesn't rely on some speculative future technology, or something along those lines. Just my two cents, don't care if it's what you're looking for, OP, I just like typing.","2016-10-10 03:27:25","2","[deleted]","1747946415.890334","green energy transition","manual"

However, we can still maintain a good quality of life if most of our energy source is renewable. Take Iceland, for example. Almost all of their electricity is renewable!","2016-10-09 22:19:58","1","hughjiang","1747946415.893182","green energy transition","manual"
