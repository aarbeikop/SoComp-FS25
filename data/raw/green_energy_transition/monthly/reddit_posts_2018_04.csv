Fossil emissions are going down 1% / 10 years, as part of total world energy demand.

Fossil emissions must go down **100% in 20 years** to stay below 2° C says Stefan Rahmstorf. 

James Hansen says 2° C = DISASTER, and Kevin Anderson says we have a 5% chance of success. 

This means we have 95% chance of not avoiding disaster in 20 years.

A new report finds that none of the negative emission technologies has the potential to deliver carbon removals at the gigaton (Gt) scale and at the rate of deployment envisaged by the IPCC, including reforestation, afforestation, carbon-friendly agriculture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, or direct air capture and carbon storage (DACCs).""

I’m passionate about renewable energy, like so many other people here. What I don’t know is what role I can play in this industry, and that’s why I’m here.

I’m a soon-to-be Master’s graduate majoring in Accountancy and Financial Management, so I’m not an engineer and I also don’t want to be. What I’m looking for is advice from people in the industry on what kind of role a “financial management” guy could play.

I’ve always been interested in management consulting, private equity and venture capital. Is it interesting to start off in Private Equity, for example, and then try and move to Renewable Energy? Or start in a big energy firm in a commercial role and try get moved to a renewable energy division in the longer term?

Any advice is welcome, I would love to have an interesting discussion on this.","2018-04-11 21:50:07","2","11","0.61","https://www.reddit.com/r/Renewable/comments/8bky89/soontobe_graduate_asking_for_advice/","True","EnergyGrad","1747965722.86641","green energy transition","manual"
