But as is the case with any and every elected official, the real work begins once they’re put in office. Every MF needs to be pressured, organized either behind or against, and held accountable to the big rhetoric they use to get elected.","2019-08-26 11:08:01","37","gh05t_w0lf","1747982689.0901928","green energy transition","manual"

Imagine a family doing everything to build a castle according to a large map on papers. Good large papers.

They did everything to build it as perfect as it was instructed. They even ruined other people's homes to get the resources they needed to build their dream house.

They borrowed.

They lied to borrow.

They did everything.

Finally came the final day and the man and the wife were happy to do the last work, they saw the last step. A nice golden key had to be put somewhere and they would be inside their magical house. They called all their children and grandchildren to the party.

All lined up. And the man took the golden key. 1, 2, 3. Everyone there. The key was inside. The man turned it. And ... a huge cold steel started to move up to cover everything and buried the whole scene.

The man buried himself and all his family in a perfect grave.

Later they wrote the man did every detail right, except he forgot to look around and from distance to see what he is building.

That's what according to plan means. That's what capitalism did. That's what ""economical growth"" did.

We can only hope to see what we did before it is too late.","2019-08-26 12:15:28","9","k3surfacer","1747982689.094986","green energy transition","manual"

"ey7mqke","t3_cvmh7l","cvmh7l","collapse","skeptical","In my opinion, emissions = population x standard of living.

We were boned once China stopped being (as) poor. We're completely boned once their average standard of living reaches parity with the US if not before.

People will not willingly give up what comprises their standard of living, be it property, convenience, etc. It is in our animal nature. A few idealists might, but not any meaningful segment of the population. The only way to reduce emissions and consumption is to curb population growth. We've shown that once a society reaches a given standard of living (US, western Europe, Japan, South Korea, etc), their population starts shrinking without immigration. The problem is that the entire globe will never reach that standard of living before we run out of resources.","2019-08-27 07:14:22","1","mgtau","1747982689.101995","green energy transition","manual"

I know growth can result from efficiency increases, but these are finite. And there is only so much human time and labor, and limited resource flows and finite stocks.

What, exactly, is it that is supposed to be able to grow forever? Perpetual growth has convinced me that economists should be diagnosed with a type of mental illness.

Seriously - their thinking should be seen as a memetic pathology that has to be quarantined and cured if possible. It's going to destroy the future.","2019-08-11 20:00:42","2","AArgot","1747982711.923698","green energy transition","manual"
