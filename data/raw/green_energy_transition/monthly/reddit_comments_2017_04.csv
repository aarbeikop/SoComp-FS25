"dgdh6eu","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","What are your opinions on nuclear power.

In my eyes renewable energy sources are not efficient enough to carry the energy demands of a big country. Especially those that do not benefit from solar or hydroelectric power have to rely on fossil fuels for electricity.

Nuclear power has its known risks but it can cut emissions for a low price. I think opting to combat climate change and opting against nuclear power are a combination that dont go well. I had Germany in mind when typing this. All the negatives of nuclear due to its neighbours, increased electricity prices, and increased reliance on coal. Climate change was used specifically to drive a political agenda.

What are your opinions on this.

"dgdi946","t3_65v4mc","65v4mc","science","scientific","* Thanks for doing an AMA. As much as I understand that climate change by human activity is very real, I have always wondered if it made any sense to unilaterally act to reduce our carbon foot print. Even if the relatively richer west magically cuts out carbon emissions totally, which is impossible, the rest of the world (and thats a vast majority of human activity!) isn't going to do so. This is as much a political issue as it is a scientific one. If governments elsewhere can't even get a gripe on wars, crimes, corruption., etc.. there is no way they will start listening to the rich west telling them to slow down on development and be clean, even if they did believe in the legitimacy of the science, which itself has become debate in the west.


* I have always argued that rather than fund climate change policies, it would do a whole lot more good to simply fund education (reduce human stupid) and new technologies that out strip carbon reliance (this we have some, but not quite there yet). So that the developing nations actually want to adopt new methods of energy production. It is still economics in the end.


* I compare this situation to cancer research; I once attended a seminar where a speaker controversially declared that had all the billions in cancer research been instead channeled into eradicating cigarettes (taking down the big and powerful lobby of tobacco companies) and bad modern diets (as well as crap food lobbies), it would have prevented a whole lot more cancers than any of the new treatments and drugs combined.
