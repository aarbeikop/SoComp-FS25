I’ve worked in the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and aerospace & defense sectors, and I continue to work with industrial partners to implement more sustainable and greener chemistry and engineering. AMA.","Hi Reddit!

I’m currently the Director of the [American Chemical Society’s Green Chemistry Institute](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry.html) where we work to catalyze and enable the implementation of green chemistry and engineering throughout the global chemistry enterprise.  

Before coming to the ACS, I spent a few years as Lockheed Martin’s Corporate Vice President of Energy, Environment, Safety, and Health. However, I spent most of my career at GlaxoSmithKline leaving as the Director of Operational Sustainability in the Corporate Environment, Health, and Safety Department. While there I championed and lead the development of programs, business processes, tools, and systems to promote more sustainable business practices throughout the corporation.  

So, feel free to ask me anything about what the ACS GCI does. You may also ask me anything about the current state of green chemistry and engineering. Feel free to ask me anything about how green chemistry is implemented in the pharmaceuticals industry.  I could also answer questions about solvent selection in chemical processes, green chemistry metrics, life cycle inventory/assessment, environmental fate and effects, and environmental, safety and health programs. I’m also happy for you to ask me anything about the future of sustainable and green chemistry.
