I have googled quite a bit but I was hoping you could drop some science bombs on me from a science diet viewpoint. I have a powdered form of chicory root and I hope that does something.

What other food or food combinations are so good for specific goals that they should be a main focus: weight loss, muscle gain, brain health, vascular health etc... 

You mentioned new sugar limits and I have read it is toxic when processed by our gut. Can you give a good explanation of how bad or how harmless sugar really is? If the sugar industry has threatened to kill you I understand if you don't answer this one. 

And my last question. How bad and how good is butter for you? I was debating this with some family as they say its all bad and no good and would not hear that is has any benefits. Do you feel butter is all bad? You indicated the new guidelines recommend an i crease of certain fats.

We have the technology to move richer countries (e.g. Denmark, Australia, Germany) off CO2, but poorer countries will not want to do it. 

Oil dependent poorer countries, HAVE TO SELL OIL or else their society collapses (Syria!). They will sell the oil at any price (above extraction cost). 

Also, there are upper-middle-income countries, who say that oil/coal is their national treasure and they will keep on using it for themselves and will actively DENY that CO2 emissions have any global impact (e.g. Poland, Russia).
