The same study also said that by the year 2100, there is a very large possibility that any culture or life near the coast line (within 20-30 miles I do believe) will be required to relocate due to the increase of melted ice causing the water levels to rise to new heights, effectively nearly eliminating the current coast lines.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by efficiency? If you are referring to the turnovers of the catalyst, what do you think might be causes of catalyst deactivation? I am totally unfamiliar with heterogeneous water oxidation devices so I apologize in advance if I'm off-track here.

I'm also curious about the context by which to interpret the 1% efficiency figure given for natural photosynthesis - in homogeneous water oxidation catalysis, people usually talk about falling short of beating the turnover number or turnover frequency of the Oxygen Evolving Center in plants. Is there a reason why this doesn't seem to be the case for examples involving heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts?

Could you share your thoughts about collaboration in the field of water oxidation? Do your grad students do all the synthesis, electrochem, and spectroscopy by themselves, or is some of the analytical work offloaded to other PIs' labs? 

In the case of the former, are those grad students supported full-time by a research grant (versus having to teach part-time)? Do you think it's needed, given the nature of the work?

>to enable predictive chemical design through innovative applications of data

What data do you mean exactly? Do you mean data that is already out there in the literature? Do you mean future data that will be collected? What do you even mean by data? do you mean raw spectra and results? or do you mean higher level data like structure-activity relationships? 

Because if you are talking about changing the way raw data is collected to make it consistent then I am all for this movement (would make my life MUCH easier). But if you are talking about higher level data that makes much more sense. What I imagine is pooling data and looking for long range trends that are not obvious to the lone chemist as they sit there interpreting 50 different NMR spectra. 

But the next obvious question is how do you deal with data integrity? Every chemist has been lazy and not dried their sample and got a solvent peak or forgetting to take the baseline their IR and ended up with a giant OH peak from air moisture. These mistakes are fine if interpreted and accounted for but I could see these muddying up computations. 

I guess what my main question is how does your project fit into my research as a chemist? At the moment my research goes:

* 1. Observation
* 2. Hypothesis
* 3. Experiment to test hypothesis
* 4. Back to 1. 

Where would the ""better innovation ecosystem"" fit in? Would it be used to extract interesting initial observations or would it fit in more in the experimental area?

"d7up5un","t3_53mv68","53mv68","science","scientific","So I know there's a lot of computational techniques out there to characterize a composition and structure, find the electron energy levels and pretty much everything follows from there.  It can be computationally intensive, but reasonably feasible at least for things smaller than big ol' proteins.

 So I can see an idea of desiring certain properties looking at a database, finding molecules in the neighborhood, conjecturing structures, modeling the properties, iterating and producing some candidates.  

That might not actually be the right idea, but that's the impression I get.  I'm wondering about the thing I don't have any real knowledge in. Synthesis methods.  Is developing novel synthesis methods a factor? Is there any space in chemistry for things like reinventing the wheel with more environmentally friendly precursors? 

I would guess, from my admittedly naive point of view, that predicting the time evolution at finite temperatures of ensemble of randomly oriented and molecules to predict the reaction pathways available and the equilibria would be computationally inaccessible.  Does the sort of real ability to look at novelty in designing synthesis, passing through intermediate structures, and generally planning a path through a complex phase space exist robustly already in ways that I just don't know much about? Or are synthesis methods largely confined to branching out from a finite set well worn empirical paths? Is any of this a factor in the concept of smarter chemistry?

"d7ukmzx","t3_53mv68","53mv68","science","scientific","Was a research chemist for over ten years. I am very excited and enthusiastic still over promoting innovation and outreach. With the price of tuition and university overhead it became cheaper to hire a post doc than a grad student. Eventually I had to spend more time writing proposals to cover my own salary than doing research, much less being able to support additional personnel, as federal funding becomes more competitive with each government shutdown and anti-science policies that ebb and want with each election cycle.  The push to encourage innovation in chemistry especially via NSF outlets, to me is both a very smart thing to do economically, but also comes at the expense of respect for basic research that is not application based.  My question is, to what extent do you feel that the push for ""innovation"" in the lab is jeopardizing fundamental research for the sake of applied, marketable, monetizable research? Is it in some respects ""privatizing"" research by letting big corporations donate to otherwise publicly funded research, or on the flip side, pressuring researchers to patent rather than discover so universities can profit from it beyond what they already took from overhead?   

I don't mean to sound bitter. I did receive a substantial part raise by leaving academia. I do still believe the goals, of fiddling the American economy through innovation, and teaching researchers to be open minded about application, to be important.
