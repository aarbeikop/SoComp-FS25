1. Recognize your limits. Think global, act local
2. Dont change jobs/move etc without careful thought. You want to be ready for climate change but also be hleping
3. Start up cycling items (much better than recycling) and buy the least amount of stuff possible. These days you can pretty much do everything on a phone and laptop, and other hobbies can be done at home pretty easily (knitting, sewing, wood working, gardening). When recreating/travel..think exercise, healthy, low impact..camping, hiking etc.

"e7ilzsx","t3_9mzouo","9mzouo","climatechange","action-oriented","If you spend just a little time reading past posts in this forum, you'll see that this question is a constant refrain here. The frequency with which this question arises — plus the reuse of similar themes, and sometimes language — strongly suggests the work of bots or other automated/rote posting accounts...on *some* occasions. 

So: Repeating here my comment from [another post on a similar topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/95p77y/what_else_can_i_do_to_help/e3ul7wo/):

***

In a word, the solution is: Adaptation.

Which people are pretty good at in the long run, as long as we have access to some key tools: science, technology, finance, and a modest amount of global coordination.

Technology is a big one. Eventually technology will develop solutions to three problems:

1) Making fossil fuels a minor source of energy supply, instead of a major one like they are now.

2) Finding a way to extract and sequester the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

3) Making the global climate a tunable environment, like a laboratory or a manmade lake or your bedroom.

The question is, how quickly will these problems encounter technological fixes? #3 probably isn't happening in this century, but seems possible for the next. #1 and #2 are unpredictable, but it's reasonable to guess that major strides will be made in this century.

In the meantime, technology will also be needed to enable populations to adjust to some local phenomena:

1) Sea-level rise, by investing in coastal defense. (A technology which has existed for millennia.)

2) Ocean acidification.

3) Ecosystem pressures, possibly including some collapses. These could be severe, although note that ecosystems have collapsed in the past and civilization has adjusted well enough to those.

4) A higher-energy troposphere, which might mean more severe storms.

The financial system is an integral part of developing the necessary technologies, making the necessary investments, and possibly developing the necessary global coordination. In fact, for now burning fossil fuels is probably also an integral part of that process.

There's more than technology needed, of course. There's also a great need to amass huge amounts of data — so climate risks and fixes can be properly modeled and priced, for instance. Most of that data isn't available now, but amassing it in the future is another part of the solution.

But again, the solution condensed into a single word is: Adaptation. Which people are pretty good at, once a pressing need develops. If you are very concerned about climate risks, then you'll be constantly improving capacities to adapt — yours, and your society's.

There may in fact be no point in your living or starting a family, but the climate is not one of the top hundred most important influences on that decision. It might not even be in the top thousand. Its influence could easily be negligible.

Anyone who decides not to start a family will get full encouragement from me; I think plenty of people make ill-considered decisions about that. But regardless of my encouragement, you should invest in whatever makes you feel happy and fulfilled, and enables you to play a constructive role in helping other people reach their goals.

Also here's another comment on a similar topic:

[It's fair to say that technology will continue to advance, and the problem of excess atmospheric CO2 is not insoluble in principle. Inevitably one day we'll have the ability to tune the composition of the atmosphere, if we wish. But the main complication is: We have a lot of other civilization-level problems to solve, many of them extremely urgent, and the vast majority of our technological resources are going to be dedicated to addressing those problems (as they should be).](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/97rzul/technology_might_still_save_us/e4aj79h/).

And this one too:

[The endgame — for the second half of the 21st century, let's say — is: Global economic growth will slowly converge with its historical average. Technology advances will continue to accelerate mildly. These trends will continue to be partially obscured by exogenous shocks of varying disruptiveness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e6700hr/)

And amplifying that one:

[Really, climate change is not greatly different than a lot of exogenous shocks that have existed for centuries, and which we tend to feel (and measure) in economic conditions first. My answer is just a summary of economic orthodoxy of the post-WWII era — there's nothing original in it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e672k83/)

And more about the process of climate adaptation:

[Adaptation is unquestionably the best strategy for confronting climate issues — at least until the global climate system is understood well enough to be predictably altered via relatively modest steps. (An achievement which is at least several decades in the future, maybe a century.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9j2oum/deep_adaption_in_bloomberg_businessweek/e6r09av/)","2018-10-10 15:11:55","8","DocHarford","1747971416.396336","green energy transition","manual"
