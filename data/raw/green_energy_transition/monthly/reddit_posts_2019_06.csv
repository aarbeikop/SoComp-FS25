"c18wl0","climatechange","action-oriented","What are your ideas for explaining the science of climate change as easily as possible?","I was hoping we could have a discussion about easy ways to spread the science! I've noticed that the main issue I have in any climate change discussion is that I don't have enough time to properly explain the science in any way that has real impact. I was hoping /r/climatechange could help me solve this problem. If you have suggestions for other points or other ways to get across those points, I'll add them gladly! Try to be as short and impactful as possible. Here's some topics, and ideas that don't seem very effective because they're too long:

&#x200B;

1. Why gases cause the climate to change:

&#x200B;

(I've been told that this idea misrepesents the information by /u/deck_hand, although I personally think the cause and affect relationship is decent) We know a warm object in a cold room becomes cool, and a cold object in a warm room becomes warm. The earth is sort of like the opposite of a cooler. It keeps us warm in the absolute zero temperatures of space. The power source of this heater is the combination of gases covering the surface that trap heat emitted by the sun. Putting more of these gases into the atmosphere is the converse of putting more ice in the cooler, the planet gets more hot rather quickly.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa 

2. The reason this is multiplicative:

&#x200B;

When you put ice in a cooler, the cooler and objects inside don't become instantly cold. No, the ice slowly heats up the surrounding air and the objects inside. Then, because it's a cooler, the ice stays frozen for a long while. Even when the ice begins to melt, the temperature doesn't reach above freezing until all of the ice has melted. Now apply that concept to the planet on a global scale. The planet slowly heats up over the course of years due to released emissions, then it will stay like heated while the gases stay trapped in our atmosphere. Whereas the ice melts in a few hours, because of the size of the planet, most of these gases won't leave our atmosphere for 100 years.

&#x200B;

3. The reason it's detrimental:

&#x200B;

Key points could possibly be; sea level rise, increased weather anomalies/anomaly severity with decreased predictability, why the small change in temperature has enough impact to kill off hundreds of species.

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa:  We are currently on track for warming of close to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Temperatures have changed in the past too. The last 200 thousand years or so, we can clearly distinguish 6 ice ages. The last ice age resulted in a build up of a huge glacier across Northern US and Northern Europe. New York was buried under 1 km of ice. The ice reached higher than the skyscrapers do today. The global temperature difference then with respect to today: 4 degrees Celsius 

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  A warming climate produces more extreme weather events, and this has a detrimental impact on our ability to grow food. Right now for example, huge swathes of farmland in the US are waterlogged and this season's crops are therefore in danger of failing. In the UK, the average size of potatoes was down, and in Italy they lost about 59% of their olive yield. They sound like ""cute"" stories, but both were attributed to more frequent extreme weather affecting the growth of the crops. If the anomalous weather becomes too frequent, the serious issue is obvious. This also affects wild animals, whose food sources will be disrupted.

&#x200B;

~~4. Why we don't see the affects in a lot of the first world:~~

4. How different areas see different affects:

&#x200B;

Should talk about the atmospheric system and how heat is distributed out around the planet from the equator, thus equatorial countries take the brunt. Could possibly bring up the increased rate of expansion of the Sahara. The changes then occurred over approx 10000 years. We're achieving the same increase in as little as 100 years.  

&#x200B;

From /u/Macralicious:  The California wildfires, extreme cold across the Midwest last winter, all of the aforementioned crop growing issues. The reason we don't notice as much (in my opinion) is that most of the first world has relatively mild climates to begin with; the impacts of climate change are felt more in Africa for example because they were closer to the boundary of what's habitable in the first place. They also have lesser resources and infrastructure that would enable them to be robust against, and cope with, the anomalies.

&#x200B;

5. How do we deal with complete discreditors?

&#x200B;

From /u/Wallawallawallawa: Of course there is lobbying of green groups, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. And wouldn't you expect there to be more lobbying by powerful oil interests?""  Exxon instead buried this knowledge and ferociously lobbied against the it. All of this was uncovered by pulitzer prize nominated research journalism.

Climate Change is easily the greatest existential threat to civilization today. If you are not aware of its potential effects, a[ recent report by the Breakthrough Centre For Climate Restoration](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_b2c0c79dc4344b279bcf2365336ff23b.pdf) says that Civilization could end by 2050 if Climate Change continues at the rate we see today.

Arguments can be made for Nuclear War, Mass Migration, and other issues being the greatest threat to humanity.

But steps have been taken to address those threats- especially in the United States.

Unfortunately, Climate Change has hardly been addressed in the United States in the way it needs to be. The fact that[ 97% of actively publishing climate scientists](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) believe climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities- and that we have[ a President who outright denies climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940)\- proves that point.

What can we do? Let’s start out with the basics. 

The United States is a world leader, no matter your view on the current government administration. [As the 12th richest country in the world](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/richest-countries-in-the-world), the United States has the power to help create the needed change to prevent absolutely catastrophic global warming- but we will need a complete shift away from the current political, social, and economic structure we see in the United States (and the world) today. The solutions to Climate Change are already ready to be deployed. As young activist Greta Thunberg said, “People tell me I should study to become a climate scientist so I can solve the climate crisis. But the Climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is wake up and change.” Greta is right. Studies have been done to show that [100% renewable energy in the United States is achievable by 2050](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/here-s-roundmap-get-us-run-100-renewable-energy-2050/). And frankly, we have no excuses, because other studies have shown [100% renewable energy around the WORLD ](https://physicsworld.com/a/a-global-100-renewable-energy-system/)is achievable by 2050. There are three sectors that I mentioned earlier that will be imperative in making lofty goals like these possible; economic, social, and political. Let’s go over them. 

Politically, lobbying is a huge problem, as[ Fossil Fuel giants pour money into the greedy mouths of corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/25/oil-and-gas-giants-spend-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-infographic/#6442f5017c4f) politicians to halt climate change action that would greatly affect Fossil Fuel Giant's profits. First off, [lobbying](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/) from Corporations must be cut off from the government- and I mean the entirety of the Government, not just Presidential Campaigns.  Then, a complete switch of executive power in the United States to a President who supports a form of a Green New Deal to push the United States to a position where leading the world to a future of[ less than 2 degrees Celsius of warming](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-heat-related-deaths) is needed. Unless those measures are taken, a future that locks in to 3 degrees Celsius of Warming is likely- and[ that would be absolutely catastrophic.](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/?utm_source=web&utm_campaign=Redirect) But why us, some of you may be asking? Why do we have to step up when we see movements starting all around the world to oppose man made Climate Change? It's a simple answer.[ The United States is a world leader in CO2 emissions](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions). And after ten years of decline in emissions levels from 2005 to 2015, United States emissions aren’t decreasing at the rate they need to be, and have either plateaued or increased. Without a full reaction to Climate Change in the United States, full efforts around the world would be much less effective as we continue to cloud our judgement with the haze of fossil fuels.

But again- where does the 2020 Presidential Election play into this? 

Look.[ Clearly, we can't rely on Congress](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++). Many of its members- and key ones, too- take payments from Big Oil and Fossil Fuel corporations that impede progress. Members of the Senate and House have been corrupted by these corporations,[ through lobbying](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuel-interests-have-outspent-environmental-advocates-101-on-climate-lobbying) and direct payments. It’s a shocking, sad reality- but money has taken priority over human lives and the future of our world as a whole. Also, AOC’s [‘Green New Deal’ didn’t even get through the Senate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-fails-advance-green-new-deal-democrats-protest-mcconnell-sham-n987506) (not that that was a surprise). What’s needed is the House and Senate to be in control of the Democratic Party- then clearly, a Green New Deal could be passed. As Robinson Meyer, a writer for The Atlantic who covers climate change stated, “Every additional Senate seat that Democrats take in 2020 could help them pass a Green New Deal. Sudden demographic change—such as a surge in enthusiasm among young voters—could push electoral math in Democrats’ direction.” [But that is far from a guarantee, even if it is possible](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/green-new-deal-why-democrats-will-struggle/581245/). With that in mind, a Democratic President who is willing to take Executive action to push Green policies into place would be needed. Why not just wait until 2024, though, if it isn’t likely pass a Green New Deal in 2020? If you’ve been paying attention, you know we are living on time we don’t have. Every day that passes digs us deeper into the climate grave we are burying ourselves in. [Any possible executive action](https://thebulletin.org/2019/03/what-could-happen-if-a-democratic-president-declared-a-national-climate-emergency/) against climate change if the Senate and House aren’t controlled by Democrats will have to be taken. It wouldn’t be pretty, but it’d be a necessary step. 

Socially, communities must understand that creating change to stop climate change doesn't come from driving an electric car, or going to the local Farmer's Market. Creating Change includes stepping up to buyback power grids from private companies that inhibit renewable energies- as we’ve seen [in Germany](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/political-breakthroughs-brighten-outlook-for-germanys-grid-expansion#gs.is6vp3) (although there have been problems- see the link). When the electricity grids are put in government control, all of a sudden the interests are put into what the people want, and not what the private shareholders want- which is obviously more money. This is happening here in the States, not just Germany- [take Boulder, Colorado as an example](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/04/18/boulder-makes-68-5m-offer-to-acquire-xcel-energy-assets-as-it-works-toward-municipal-utility/). However, only one state in the United States has a completely publicly owned electricity sector. That state is Nebraska, where there are lower electricity rates than the national average. A greater push is needed to promote renewable energy in cities across the United States. People must decide whether climate action is important enough to them to vote in government officials who will create change- and if they do, they must go out and vote in that way! Those same people must also take part in stepping out of the fundamental free market property known as mass consumerism. I’ll let this quote from The New Republic explain it for you. 

“C40 Cities, a network of 94 of the world’s biggest cities, released a report on Wednesday estimating how much consumption habits drive the climate crisis. The results were staggering: In those nearly 100 cities, where a combined 700 million live, the consumption of goods and services “including food, clothing, aviation, electronics, construction and vehicles” is responsible for 10 percent of global greenhouse gases. That’s nearly double the emissions from every building in the entire world.”

If you connect the dots, it’s easy to tell that a much more conservative, get-what-you-need lifestyle is a necessary part to implement into every day society if we are to slow climate change at the rate it needs to be slowed. So how does that relate to the 2020 election? Well, it’s pretty easy to tell that simply asking people to travel less and consume less won’t work. People need to elect in officials that will put policies in place to create the needed lifestyle. There must be a total infrastructure redevelopment in order to make this work. That includes greatly pushing public transit, reducing urban sprawl tenfold, increasing clean water supplies, and reducing food deserts so low income and lower class people can access the resources they need. Those lower income people also need to have less financial stress too- which we could see come into play through nationwide healthcare and a flexible living wage that would be different state to state depending on what an accurate living wage is in a given state. You see, the 2020 election is going to light a path that all of our futures will take. That’s especially true for the lower class that I’ve mentioned. They are the ones who will be most greatly affected by Climate Change, and ironically, they are the least responsible for Climate Change. Those with high amounts of wealth are the ones who most directly cause Climate Change, through travel and mass consumption, among other things. That’s why political austerity and tax slashes for the rich literally need to be reversed- taxes need to be placed on the rich in order to improve life for those who are least responsible for climate change but will be most greatly affected by Climate Change. Once that is achieved, the stages of a Green New Deal can be put in place to curb climate emissions and create new jobs. That includes massive investments in building public transit, creating city wide composting systems, building more affordable housing, redesigning city layouts to be more compact, and many more options that will [create millions of jobs](https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal). This all connects back to 2020 because literally none of this can happen without communities coming out to vote for the candidates that will make this all possible. The social revolution that I have outlined can and will happen- but it all banks on you and 2020. 

Every person reading this and every person in the United States has a voice. But who’s voice is louder; the people’s, or the green bills in their pockets? Economically, money has the loudest voice in our current state. What is that current state, you may ask? Unfettered Capitalism. Around the world, free trade agreements, corporations, and political corruption influence our green future and our present society the most. Corporations and Fossil Fuel Companies are allowed to spread over the world and pump emissions into the atmosphere at catastrophic rates- a [2017 Guardian ](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change)article said that 71% of global emissions are caused by roughly 100 companies. Of those companies, fossil fuels are the worst- “ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988.” If those companies are allowed to run rampant all over the world, drilling oil and making billions while guaranteeing the deaths of millions, than we have slammed the door on our already closing coffin. But if a step away from unfettered capitalism is made towards a more government regulated business sector that removes the ability of corporations to lobby and places strict environmental restrictions on those corporations, then there is hope. Free trade agreements also greatly inhibit efforts to stop climate change, and they must be restructured in order to save the planet. Naomi Klein, author of ‘This Changes Everything (:) Capitalism vs The Climate’ stated, “As the free trade system was put in place and producing offshore became the rule, emissions did more than move- they multiplied.” Trade agreements are severely lacking in environmental regulations- and the Behemoth of trade agreements, the WTO, is the worst of them all. [Their website even says the following](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm): “The WTO has no specific agreement dealing with the environment.”  They even go further to say, “...the removal of trade restrictions and distortions can yield benefits both for the multilateral trading system and the environment.” These are just two among many environmental hypocrisies you can find on their site that I linked in above. [Green protectionism](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/envir_req_e.htm) is a particularly fun one that inhibits local renewable energy efforts. Clearly, that’s barely brushing the surface but I do believe you see the point I’m trying to make; Unfettered Capitalism must be stopped in order to save our planet. The 2020 Election is the time for us to step up and vote in a leader who will see these problems and make the needed moves. 

All of these changes are possible! That much is clear. 

Yet here we are,[ pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/06/01/one-year-since-trumps-withdrawal-from-the-paris-climate-agreement/) (Which isn't enough, by the way) and[ pushing billions of dollars into the fossil fuel industry through government subsidies.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them)

It's clear that the Trump administration isn't going to do anything to stop Climate Change- as I've helped illustrate, they encourage it. So when 2020 rolls around, GO VOTE. Vote for our future, and vote for our planet. I’ll never force on you who to vote for- but I’ll tell you one thing. The candidate I want to win? He’s not favored to win because of ‘electability’. :).

"bwxwtk","environment","emotional","Funding green living though Carbon Tax","Wrote this essay for my political science class and was curious about others opinions.

&#x200B;

Since the late 1800’s, the past 5 years have been the hottest years on record and the temperature keeps rising. As humans, our effects on this drastic change is apparent, from a natural perspective, the largest source of Co2 comes from volcanoes generating 200 million tons of carbon annually, just our automotive and industrial activities alone cause 23 billion world wide in the same time frame (“Are Volcanoes or Humans Harder on the Atmosphere?”). Solving Climate Change is going to be a long and difficult process, our modern and comfortable ways of life here in American would be altered completely but if left undealt with, its estimated that Damages could be as high as 20% of worldwide GDP, if action is taken it would only cost 1-4% of the GDP by 2030. Being that buildings are responsible for 38% of all Co2 emissions (“How Buildings Impact the Environment”), changing the way American housing is handled would prove to be very beneficial to reducing this number. For example, by increasing the use of individual green energy systems such as household solar power and decreasing the use of exposed concrete in cities are both simple ways a positive impact can be made. 

Before we look at the ways we can help decrease the impact of buildings, it's important to figure out where funding for projects of this magnitude could come from. Creating restrictions such as a carbon tax could prove to be beneficial. The Carbon Tax method can be seen in use worldwide (26 programs total) and is proving to have good effects on the economy and environment alike. The B.C Government's Carbon Tax Brochure describes the idea behind the method, “Tax the pollution we do not want, and return the money for what we do want - money in people’s pockets, jobs and investment.” This taxation does a good job of making the transition to a healthier environment without putting the US more in dept to ourselves. When looking at incorporating a National Carbon tax into a nation so diverse in an industrialized sense, places that are heavily industrialized or have a large population such as Texas or California, would be receiving more funding for the more improvement needed. In the end this method would create a lower and more equal carbon footprint among the states. British Columbia is only one of the many places that have taken advantage of this system. With these 26 carbon tax programs already in use, it can give us a good idea of what to expect from the system and shows that if done correctly it can be beneficial for both the economy and the planet. 

Now that the funding is out of the way, we can start looking at the changes that can be made to better our environment. As we progress further into the future, an abundance of discoveries and improvements are being made with the ability to have a substantial impact on how we go about making this change. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric and more, are quickly becoming part of our energy mix but still only account for 11% of America's energy use (“The United States Uses a Mix of Energy Sources”). Increasing this number is an important step to a healthier future. When looking at housing in rural or suburban areas, the usage of rooftop solar is pretty logical being that plenty of open roof space is available, using the money collected from the carbon tax, we would be able to fund the installation of these household solar panels. With this method all excess electricity generated could also be pumped into the grid, further lowering the reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately highly Urbanized areas currently account for 20% of our overall carbon footprint (Miller), because of the lack of roof space available and the dense living population, solar as seen in more rural areas wouldn’t prove as effective. In places such as these, the new technology of solar windows could be a major contributor in the future of city energy. According to research at Michigan State, the United States could get 40% of its electricity from solar windows, the University estimates that 5 to 7 billion square meters of usable window space is available, when paired with 15% efficient panels, that 40% could be achieved. In practice, covering those billions of window space is substantial task to be achieved, nevertheless this surely goes to show how big of a role this technology can play in future green cities even if used on a smaller scale.  

Moving away from solar, other building techniques have been proving beneficial to lowering the impact of urban areas. The Urban Heat Island effect has also had a substantial impact on the energy usage in cities. Compared to surrounding rural areas, its estimated that a city with 1 million people or more can be up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer during the day and 22 degrees warmer at night(Donegan), much of this effect can be credited towards open concrete soaking up the sun's energy, windows reflecting and the heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. With all the tall skyscrapers, the natural, cooling wind flow is also obstructed. In Nature, soil does a good job soaking up the rain, which on warm days, would be evaporated, in turn, cooling the air, with cities most of this rainwater just runs down into the sewer system. 

The introduction of window solar panels would help decrease the reflection of the sun's energy but besides that solution, looking to minimize the amount of heat soaking into the concrete would be beneficial. In Manhattan, there is up to 40 square miles of rooftop space, to help fight the urban heat, the NYC CoolRoofs program has reduced the temperature of 6 million square feet by painting the roofs white. On hot days the dark asphalt can reach up to 190 degrees, if the program continues making progress its estimated this would cool New York’s air temperature by 2 degrees (McKendry). Although just 2 degrees may seem like a small number, when put in conjunction with other methods, a noticeable difference can be made. Rooftop gardens have also been seen to make a difference, because of the water and heat soaking soil, the water evaporates creating cooler air and creating food in the process. Simple and cheap solutions like the ones listed above can have massive impacts when implemented on a citywide scale, in response to creating a cooler urban environment, the need for energy eating devices such as air conditioning would also decrease.

Creating an entirely green city would prove to be a task that may take many years but so far, we seem to be heading that direction. Using some of the methods above, digital designs of future sustainable housing developments are starting to form. Although sparse, neighborhoods are already starting to form providing to be a proof of concept, so far many are quite successful. Currently here on the Pacific Coast, a model eco-friendly neighborhood is being constructed with the goal of having little to no negative environmental impacts (no carbon, trash, and have sustainable water management). The success of developments such as this show that this change can be done, it's just the matter of time and commitment.

The change to a more Eco-friendly way of living is going to be a very long process, in order to make this change, we will at some point, need to give up many of our basic comforts we use so often. Totally changing how products are being manufactured would call for a major shift in the values corporations and civilians must follow. By starting this change from a place such as buildings and city design, we are able to make an impact without having to alter the basis of our economy relying on our industrialized ways. Other technologies are constantly improving and becoming more viable with helping this change. With more and more communities, programs, and research going into solving this issue, we are surely going to be seeing change for the better within the future.","2019-06-05 03:17:42","2","1","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bwxwtk/funding_green_living_though_carbon_tax/","True","Tobias_Muldoon","1747980272.660303","green energy transition","manual"
"c2lf8p","collapse","skeptical","The ""Hard Stop"" Collapse Scenario","I think it is most likely that the behemoth that is the global economy will plow head-on into ecological meltdown.

That is to say, when agriculture, trade, industry take a hit, the people (and governments) with a vested interested will attempt to reassert themselves and get back on top.

If the economy contracts, politicians will do whatever it takes to reverse that trend and increase growth.

If agriculture yields drop, there will be a massive mobilization to innovate a way out of the problem.

If global pandemics erupt, heroic efforts will be made to resist and contain future outbreaks.

Even if the solutions dig us deeper in the hole, we will choose them when desperate enough.

We will continue to emit carbon until it is impossible to do so.

To use a boxing metaphor, civilization will be taking the blows and hitting back less often, but they will keep standing up as long as they are able.

It will be a war of attrition, where civilization and humanity will inevitably surrender. The game may be effectively over, but it could take many years for the final thud.

This is why you shouldn’t expect a particular day, or even a year, to be THE ONE. 

Then again, there is another scenario to consider: *The Hard Stop.*

Guy McPherson’s theory is an example of the Hard Stop scenario. 

The Blue Ocean event triggers the Clathrate Gun, which collapses civilization within months, ending global dimming and unleashing global nuclear plant meltdowns and other feedback loops, leading to unfathomable warming and a Venus-like hellscape. 

The whole process (as I recall) takes place in a matter of months.

To me, that’s a lot of hypothetical dominoes lined up in a very specific sequence. 

But I don’t think a Hard Stop scenario would need to be as bad as all that.

So what would it require and what would it include?

To me, a Hard Stop Collapse Scenario is *an event or series of events, within a 5 year duration, in which global economic GDP, emissions, and (likely) population plummet to pre-industrial levels—and do not bounce back.*

**Why 5 years?** 

I think that you must have a timeframe in which political actors simply couldn’t respond. No time for protests in the streets, no time for a revolution. No time to install “pro-growth” policies.

**What could cause such an event?**

A global nuclear war, in which all parties lost. A Black Death-like pandemic. Perhaps a “methane bomb” release in the arctic, as Guy imagines.

Perhaps there could be a Very Bad Year across Asia in which drought, heatwave, water shortage, food shortage, lead to a billion plus refugees attempting to migrate/escape to the rest of the world, leading a cascade of nation-state collapses. Like, there are so many victims that they overwhelm and destroy every safe haven they come to. Every economic and political system just disintegrates.

**Would a Hard Stop Collapse save us (or some of the planet at least)?**

The longer industrial civilization can plow on into the 21st Century, the worse the future will be. That much is obvious.

So would a Hard Collapse help?

Maybe some, but my guess is probably not. For five reasons:

First, in any scenario, not including nuclear war, warming would continue for a while due to the end of global dimming.

Second, if enough people survived, they may exist in a “de-regulated” anarchy, in which people would burn anything they want without penalty. Or may revert to more primitive forms of energy, like burning wood, which is not good.

Third, if GDP is gone, then geoengineering is probably off the table. This means that somehow locking carbon into the melting permafrost will not be imaginable, let alone feasible. Flying planes to seed the atmosphere at any scale may be impossible, too.

Fourth, we are a global community, connected by telecommunications and global summits. Climate change and other global problems require coordination or else you run into a Prisoner’s Dilemma (or a Tragedy of the Commons). We can’t even achieve this now. But a Hard Stop Collapse probably means any kind of global coordination would be exceedingly difficult.

Fifth, transitioning to a green/clean economy today requires using the wealth we have to invest, R&D, and lower costs through economies of scale (which require large populations necessarily). A Hard Stop scenario would mean we have a much smaller, much poorer population. The whole reason we got hooked on coal, oil, etc. is that it was so easy to get energy from. Ironically, a green/clean energy revolution may actually be harder without an incumbent fossil fuel industry than with it.

**Is it likely?**

Personally, I don’t think so. But Black Swan events never seem that way, until they happen. Then they are obvious. 

I DO think there could be a lot of collapse-bounce back a little-collapse again-bounce back-collapse, with some regions collapsing harder and faster than others, while others suffer less relatively speaking.

But it’s certainly possible.

It will build a renewable energy platform that will help to raise funds for renewable energy projects by issuing their own energy tokens. On [TerraGreen](https://wallet.terragreen.io) platform users will get in depth information about profit earning renewable energy projects.

TerraGreen will introduce transparency in its ecosystem in which its users will be able to use the renewable energy backed token in exchange for fiat currencies or as a payment for the amount of energy consumed.","2019-06-24 06:34:57","1","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Renewable/comments/c4jb0r/need_for_renewable_energy/","True","terragreencoin1","1747980963.3084931","green energy transition","manual"

TerraGreen helps energy producers to attract capital directly from end users and investors.

TerraGreen will play a key role in the terms of facilitation of investments into the renewable energy and trade of energy.

\*  Investors:

The  TerraGreen platform makes the trade between the energy producers and  consumers the most and attract the attention of most of the investors to  invest in the projects with the help of TerraGreen coin.","2019-06-06 04:49:22","1","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Renewable/comments/bxcm7d/terragreen_platform_users_verticals/","True","terragreencoin1","1747980964.7329679","green energy transition","manual"
