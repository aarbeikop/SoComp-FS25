"dtacvg5","t3_7t4fse","7t4fse","collapse","skeptical","Interesting point on peak copper. I had never considered it, because copper is recyclable.

> To date only about 12% of known copper resources have been mined. However copper ore is a finite resource and it makes sense to conserve ore by recycling. It is cheaper to recycle old copper than to mine and extract new copper. Recycled copper is worth up to 90% of the cost of the original copper.

Companies are developing autonomous mines to mine copper. And these mines that are not yet developing are high grade copper mines. This along with recycling means the ""peak"" is further than away than we think.","2018-01-26 19:51:01","7","mulgs","1747962056.881165","green energy transition","manual"

I don't think _we_ want self driving electric cars at all. 

Rather, _car makers_ want them because streets and roads are crowded already, which is the reason why when you get into an accident now there is a very good chance that you'll be in the pathway of another vehicle, whereas 40 years ago you had a higher probability of ending up in a ditch. Still bad, but less so than being flattened by a speeding truck.

Self-driving cars are aimed at optimizing traffic so that even more vehicles may go about roads merrily, ensuring a steady stream of customers for car makers :-)","2018-01-26 19:31:31","6","petit_robert","1747962056.8843782","green energy transition","manual"
"dtakwfa","t3_7t4fse","7t4fse","collapse","skeptical","> In 2016, that ore grade 0.7%. 

Technological and economic improvements make ‘peak’ anything meaningless.  50 years ago you couldn’t get usable copper from 3% for anything in the ball park of the market price.  Now the price of copper increased, so more mines are viable and the technology improved, so even lower grade ore can be used.

It’s also important to keep in mind that the energy required doesn’t scale with grade.  .7% ore does not take 2x the energy as 1.5% ore.

> Copper is unique on earth. It's the best conductor. Nothing can really and honestly replace it 

Copper isn’t unique on earth, it’s not the best conductor, and there are lots of replacements

> Last year, copper outperformed gold 

Gold is nutty, it’s performance never relates to anything other than how gold bugs feel

> What this means is that we have to use more and more fossil fuels to get less and less copper going forward 

This is wrong.  We are long past the days of throwing rocks in a furnace with some coal to get the metal.  There are entire fields of engineering and chemistry devoted to increasing ore yield while decreasing cost.  Modern refining is unrecognizable to smelters of the past.

> The only substitute we got for copper is aluminum, but it's too brittle and fire prone, not to mention expensive.

We also have iron, gold, silver.  Aluminum is already cheaper than copper and replaces copper for inexpensive wiring.  Brittleness and fire prone can both be mitigated it just means aluminum is not a drop in replacement for copper.  Copper also has some problems that aluminum doesn’t have, it’s a trad-off that includes price.  As Copper gets more expensive aluminum becomes a better and better option.  Gold already replaced copper as a conductor followed by silver.  The connectors inside chips between the chip itself and the pins is done with gold wire thinner than a human hair, copper isn’t used because it oxidizes.

> The reason for all this copper craze is because electric cars. 

Debatable, I would say windmills are more of a contributor right now.  Earlier it was the housing boom, needing copper for all those new homes to be wired up.

> and they can barely secure the huge mining contracts they need to do it

Copper is not a limiter on electric cars, the rare earth minerals are the things they are struggling to get mining contracts for.  Iron and copper are both known constant demand metals.","2018-01-26 22:03:28","3","shinosonobe","1747962056.890074","green energy transition","manual"

As to electric cars: It's indeed too little to late to make a dent in AGW-triggered disaster and their motors use indeed a lot of copper that as an electrician/electronician I see as a conundrum to find a replacement for (but it will be 100% recyclable at least) but the batteries will very likely be replaced by the at least theoretically much more attractive ultracapacitors, which will likely be based on ceramics/polymer + Graphene.","2018-01-28 13:12:02","1","[deleted]","1747962056.897664","green energy transition","manual"

Kind of like how whether or not the US and Canada start tapping their oil reserves comes back to the price of oil; if a barrel of it costs enough you can justify extracting it from tar sands or via fracking.


Otherwise, this is basically what people have been saying for years. There's no such thing as green energy. The only reliable, reasonably sustainable sources of electricity either rely on local niches- you don't just get the means to build a hydroelectric dam anywhere, geothermal doesn't work just anywhere- or has the word, 'nuclear' in it. And even nuclear power has it's limits. It just happens to have the best energy density ratio of any substance on earth.

> Do you see how easy division is? That's what drives collapse.  

While I think you're a bit pessimistic, this above quote is spot on.  Our biggest problem (and the biggest thing fucking up our society) is not oil, or water, or energy, or pollution, or even the banks, the biggest thing fucking up our society is division.  In the US, both parties have been pushing it for 15+ years because it's an easy way to score political points.  'I respect my opponent and he makes good points but I think my solution is better because _______' doesn't get nearly as many eyeballs as 'that guy is un-American' or better yet 'that political party is all un-American idiots'.  

Left and right vilify each other, and our national discussion breaks down.  Rather than work together to accomplish the things we agree on, we fight over the things we disagree on.  When the populace is distracted by divisive policy issues like abortion or immigration or the new one 'social justice', it's easy to push through an agenda under the radar.  

For example, while everybody was going nuts about the 'shithole country' comment, nobody noticed that another giant domestic spying bill passed with bipartisan support.  

When Americans unite to make something happen, we are *fucking unstoppable*.  Fortunately for those who abuse the system, we're also easily distracted.  

I think sometime in the next 10-20 years, the American populace [will realize their true power](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZe6XzGWkAA9R6i.jpg); will realize that if we unite to focus on things that we all agree on (IE get money out of politics), that opens the door to discussion on what we don't agree on.
