Unfortunately it's not compatible with our lifestyle, so the rate of change will keep accelerating, and the process that took thousands of years will happen in a few decades. The nature will fail to adapt, and so will humanity. The more primitive forms of life will survive, we won't - with the exception of the wealthy who will hide in their bunkers if it ever gets this bad.","2019-12-30 06:45:14","5","daneelr_olivaw","1747986614.850074","green energy transition","manual"

In some sense the market is a big distributed processor. We just need to turn on the switch to make it start taking into account carbon emissions.

Then the market will incentivise innovation and investment into new efficient ways to reduce emissions without people needing to worry about it competing with need to feed their families","2019-12-30 09:16:32","2","Joshau-k","1747986614.854274","green energy transition","manual"

"fcimae2","t3_ehcms0","ehcms0","climatechange","action-oriented",">Co2 is like a clear plastic bag over the earth that holds all that ricocheded sunlight energy in. Like a green house does, that is where they coined the term “green house effect”.

Wrong. Global warming has absolutely nothing to do with the greenhouse effect (aka convection limiting).

Co2 absorbs IR at specific wavelengths... it also EMITS just as well. AKA its a better conductor of heat then normal air. Because of this ability to conduct those specific wavelengths of light more efficently, Co2 is predicted to lower upper atmospheric temperatures, which contracts the global surface area of the ""atmopsheric window"" where Co2 finally allows IR through to space(around 2.7 and 15 um). This contraction is the where the heating is predicted to come from.

For visualization, imagine a fluffy ball of wire, with a piece of red hot plutonium inside. the wire conducts heat away from the plutonium core and radiates it into space. The plutonium is earth and the wire is the atmosphere. Co2 has the effect of increasing the thermal conductivity(plastic to cooper) of the wires(atmosphere) to such a degree that the entire ball of wires shrinks, reducing surface area that can radiate heat. The core of plutonium is still putting off X number of watts, but in a smaller ball of wire. Because the ball of wire shrunk, the temperature delta would be greater, and thus any point inside of the surface layer would be marginally hotter.

To date... this has not been proven... mostly because there is no evidence that the [Mie scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering) layer has actually lowered in altitude, as climate models predicted. We are talking about 5-10 meters of change for this layer, at 5-10 km in altitude.

>The earth is getting sick here is why.

The earth is fine and much your rant is based on lies and hyperbole.","2019-12-30 00:15:46","-3","FireFoxG","1747986631.455008","green energy transition","manual"

"fcj02sx","t3_ehdb1l","ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Hey there! Your post is so inspiring! I feel weird giving advice to someone who definitely is living a more conscious life than I, but a couple things I thought of are:
- air drying clothes vs in the machine
- purchasing clothes made from fabrics that do not give off microplastics in the wash
- hosting a clothing swap with your friends/family is a great way to promote circular and slow fashion! (Also look up Remake, a non profit that will give you the tools to do this and more!!)
- joining a local sustainability group like a zero waste club or one that focuses on the greener policies","2019-12-30 02:45:45","11","phomo8","1747987250.828877","green energy transition","manual"

On a more hands-on level, If you work in an office or large building, you can talk to management about how they can green the building, or conduct some guerilla energy efficiency tactics like turning off lights/thermostats in the evenings. But there's also higher level advocacy, like attending rallies, voting, as you said, or moving your career toward the environmental space. No matter what your skill set or background, you can choose your employer or occupation to benefit the environment.","2019-12-30 01:18:03","6","Tscook10","1747987250.8375092","green energy transition","manual"

For me this year it's less meat. My SO is not going to accept vegetarianism 🙄 so opting for less but locally sourced and or organic is i think my best bet. 

For you I'd echo do what you can to influence your work and community, and plant anything even if just to stop soil erosion and boost bee population.","2019-12-30 03:04:24","2","26KM","1747987250.8515468","green energy transition","manual"

Unfortunately, we need a whole lot more people living like you for it to make an impact, and current indications (a rise this year of emissions by 4%) suggest not enough are, and that we are failing in other areas too. 

Think of it in terms of scale and impact: Instead of litter picking on your own, can you find time and energy to organise an event where 10 other people attend? If you can, then you just increased the scale and impact of your actions. 

Convincing family members is a good example of this too. Good luck with that. It's a good place to start for many, and if each of us made advances here, the collective impact would be sizeable.","2019-12-30 11:17:55","2","NickBloodAU","1747987250.85473","green energy transition","manual"

This is a list I made on Amazon of reusable/sustainable products for the home like reusable q-tips, dryer balls, rechargeable batteries, silicone ziplocks, etc. It has a tool kit and sewing kit in there as I feel like it’s better to make an effort to repair something rather than throw it out and replace it. 

How I’ve essentially come up with ideas the past few years is every time I throw something away, I google whether there’s a washable/reusable version of it out there. I’ve also been trying to make/grow more of my own products at home to reduce packaging waste (buying a bulk bag of almonds that makes 4 months worth of almond milk is a lot less waste than buying fifteen cartons of almond milk). Washable air filters will be next on my list!

Cool showers have been shown to be good for your health even if they feel horrible. Good luck!","2019-12-30 08:02:08","1","[deleted]","1747987250.856641","green energy transition","manual"
