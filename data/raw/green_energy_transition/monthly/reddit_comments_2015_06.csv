"cs7anw8","t3_39wy9g","39wy9g","collapse","skeptical","Sorry but you've committed many fallacies here.  First of all your assumptions are not all based upon reliable data.  Not only unreliable, but very limited in many respects.  What we have here is you having a picture in your head, then cherry picking data that supports your forgone conclusion.  That isn't research, it's a fallacy.


Second, even if it were all true, there is no reason why hydro, fuel cell, and many, many other forms of energy generation are not promising and cannot be used in unison.  Your lack of a mention for many of these technologies and their applications speaks to you not looking enough at the whole big picture.


Third your assumption that tech will stagnate even in the industries mentioned (with the exception of SOME materials research) shows your lack of historic context.  The rate of tech growth and innovative solutions to pressing problems to humanity, especially in the last two centuries, cannot be overstated, yet you failed to mention it. 



Fourth and perhaps most importantly, you have totally ignored the political implications that drive much of this nonsense.  Not only have the fossil fuel industries paid billions for propaganda both in the media and from corrupt scientists, but many politicians have done the same.  They are attempting to present a similar scenario, which happens to run counter to the actual narrative.  At the very least there is massive bias and heated debate, leaving the conclusion far from sure.



To sum up, this neo-malthusian-esque view of the world and it's ability to generate electricity is massively flawed in almost every regard ALTHOUGH it does raise some important points.  The most important of which is this: collapse is not a forgone conclusion, it is not imminent, and any assumption of this ignores the real problems we face.  Namely the political causes of these and many other problems are not addressed.  In other words, if short sighted, greedy, ignorant fools retain power over the rest of us.","2015-06-15 16:12:23","14","[deleted]","1747910192.951274","green energy transition","manual"
