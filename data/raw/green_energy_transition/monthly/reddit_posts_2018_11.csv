"9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","What They Never Explained...","What people who insist that climate change is threatening enough to warrant aggressive policy changes have never sufficiently explained, is why it would be plausible that a belief that happens to precisely fit their emotional needs also happens to be true. Climate change alarmism looks and feels exactly like half a dozen former environmental scares, that all turned out to be wrong. So we can conclude, that many people have an emotional need to believe in such scares, and that such beliefs are exceptionally plausible to them. If we find a belief that many people strongly crave, the most likely explanation is that they believe it because they like the belief, not because it is true. That reality should oblige the emotional needs of the early 21st century green person is highly unlikely. It rather seems that global warming is a psychologism. A certain portion of the population simply wakes up with a sensation that doom is imminent, and then they come up with reasons for why this feeling is justified. The one common thread of the green era was that the world was always supposed to be ending, it was always urgent and hysterical, they just now and then changed the reason of why exactly it is ending. All these environmental scares are structurally replaceable, and seem to run the same emotional habit. The plausible explanation of these observations is not that greens must be right about the last reason they propose, but that they have some internal reason for believing in immanent doom, and then find rationalizations for it. Even traditional religion is functionally the same belief system and has been found to run on the same cognitive hardware as environmental beliefs. Warmists certainly behave like religionists, it is very important to them that everyone accepts their belief. Climate change has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations, always changing the story under the same label as old theories get refuted. The ""consensus"" thus does not confirm catastrophic global warming, but can refer to acceptance of any of the many theories with that name. Yet is always taken to confirm the current iteration of catastrophic global warming.

Edit: I'm throwing this out as a challenge. If you want to convert me, then explain it to me. I have heard plenty of the usual hostile talking points, and that's not what I'm looking for. Don't just request me to justify my claims, or nitpick at my arguments, and claim that me not making good enough arguments somehow makes your belief true. This is an opportunity to the believer, to explain to me, the disbeliever, why your belief is plausible.","2018-11-05 12:39:04","0","21","0.3","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9ud5pr/what_they_never_explained/","True","taylor-4","1747972578.111628","green energy transition","manual"

**We are overwhelmingly dependent on finite resources.**  

Fossil fuels account for 87% of the world’s total energy consumption.  [1](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources) [2](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/World_energy_consumption) [3](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-primary-energy?stackMode=relative)

Economic pressures will manifest well before reserves are actually depleted as more energy is required to extract the same amount of resources over time (or as the steepness of the EROEI cliff intensifies). [1](http://thenextturn.com/eroei-energy-cliff/) [2](https://ftalphaville-cdn.ft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Perfect-Storm-LR.pdf)

&#x200B;

**We are transitioning to renewables very slowly.**

Renewables have had an average growth rate of 5.4% over the past decade. [1](http://www.ren21.net/gsr-2018/pages/highlights/highlights/) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guXaWwQpe4) [3](https://ourfiniteworld.com/2017/01/30/the-wind-and-solar-will-save-us-delusion/) [4](http://noapp4that.org/)

Renewables are not taking off any faster than coal or oil once did and there is no technical or financial reason to believe they will rise any quicker, in part because energy demand is soaring globally, making it hard for natural gas, much less renewables, to just keep up. [1](http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/scientificamerican0114-521.pdf)

Total world energy consumption increased 15% from 2009 to 2016. New renewables powered less than 30% of the growth in demand during that period. [1](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/09/20/analysis/fossil-fuel-expansion-crushes-renewables) 

&#x200B;

**Transitioning to renewables too quickly would disrupt the global economy.**

A rush to build an new global infrastructure based on renewables would require an enormous amount resources and produce massive amounts of pollution. [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5guXaWwQpe4) [2](https://www.postcarbon.org/renewable-energy-will-not-support-economic-growth/)

&#x200B;

**Current renewables are ineffective replacements for fossil fuels.**

Energy can only be substituted by other energy. Conventional economic thinking on most depletable resources considers substitution possibilities as essentially infinite. But not all joules perform equally. There is a large difference between potential and kinetic energy. Energy properties such as: intermittence, variability, energy density, power density, spatial distribution, energy return on energy invested, scalability, transportability, etc. make energy substitution a complex prospect. The ability of a technology to provide ‘joules’ is different than its ability to contribute to ‘work’ for society. All joules do not contribute equally to human economies. [1](https://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MAHBBlog_WhereAreWeGoing40ShadesOfGray_NHagens_May2018.pdf) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6uVnyjTb58) [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6uVnyjTb58)

**Best-case energy transition scenarios will still result in severe climate change.**

Even if every renewable energy technology advanced as quickly as imagined and they were all applied globally, atmospheric CO2 levels wouldn’t just remain above 350 ppm; they would continue to rise exponentially due to continued fossil fuel use. So our best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change, with all its dire consequences: shifting climatic zones, freshwater shortages, eroding coasts, and ocean acidification, among others. Our reckoning showed that reversing the trend would require both radical technological advances in cheap zero-carbon energy, as well as a method of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and sequestering the carbon. [1](https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change)

The speed and scale of transitions and of technological change required to limit warming to 1.5°C has been observed in the past within specific sectors and technologies {4.2.2.1}. But the geographical and economic scales at which the required rates of change in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would need to take place, are larger and have no documented historic precedent.

**Global economic growth peaked forty years ago.** 

Global economic growth peaked forty years ago and is projected to settle at 3.7% in 2018. [1](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/20/global-growth-has-peaked-warns-oecd-economic-outlook) [2](https://www.businessamlive.com/global-economy-set-decade-gloom-world-bank-predicts-recovery-set-fizzle/) [3](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locati)

The increased price of energy, agricultural stress, energy demand, and declining EROEI suggest the energy-surplus economy already peaked in the early 20th century. [1](https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/the-new-economic-science-of-capitalisms-slow-burn-energy-collapse-d07344fab6be) [2](https://www.scribd.com/document/375558812/Perfect-storm-energy-finance-and-the-end-of-growth-Dr-Tim-Morgan-Global-Head-of-Research) 

The size of the global economy is still projected to double within the next 25 years. [1](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG)

Our institutions and financial systems are based on expectations of continued GDP growth perpetually into the future. Current OECD (2015) forecasts are for more than a tripling of the physical size of the world economy by 2050. No serious government or institution entity forecasts the end of growth this century (at least not publicly). [1](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-11-30/gdp-jobs-and-fossil-largesse/)

&#x200B;

**Global energy demand is increasing.**

Global energy demand has increased 0.5-2% per year from 2011-2017, despite increases in efficiency. [1](https://www.iea.org/efficiency2018/) [2](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/World_energy_consumption) [3](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32912)

Technological change can raise the efficiency of resource use, but also tends to raise both per capita resource consumption and the scale of resource extraction, so that, absent policy effects, the increases in consumption often compensate for the increased efficiency of resource use. [1](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists) [2](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jevons_paradox) [3](https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2018/02/26/Energy-Efficiency-Curse/) [4](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/6245)

**World population is increasing.**

World population is growing at a rate of around 1.09% per year (2018, down from 1.12% in 2017 and 1.14% in 2016. The current average population increase is estimated at 83 million people per year. The annual growth rate reached its peak in the late 1960s, when it was at around 2%. The rate of increase has nearly halved since then, and will continue to decline in the coming years. [1](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) [2](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth) 

&#x200B;

**Our supplies of food and water are diminishing.**

Global crop yields are expected to fall by 10% on average over the next 30 years as a result of land degradation and climate change. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03891-1)

An estimated 38% of the world’s cropland has been degraded or reduced water and nutrient availability. [1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/) [2](https://www.fewresources.org/soil-science-and-society-were-running-out-of-dirt.html)

Two-thirds of the world (4.0 billion people) lives under conditions of severe water scarcity at least one month per year. [1](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500323)

&#x200B;

**Climate change is rapidly destabilizing our environment.**

An overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree humans are the primary cause of climate change. [1](https://skepticalscience.com/Infographic-97-out-of-100-climate-experts-think-humans-causing-global-warming.html)

A comparison of past IPCC predictions against 22 years of weather data and the latest climate science find the IPCC has consistently underplayed the intensity of climate change in each of its four major reports released since 1990. [1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-science-predictions-prove-too-conservative/)

15,000 scientists, the most to ever cosign and formally support a published journal article, recently called on humankind to curtail environmental destruction and cautioned that “a great change in our stewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided.” [1](http://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/sw/files/Warning_article_with_supp_11-13-17.pdf)

Emissions are still rising globally and far from enabling us to stay under two degrees of global average warming. [1](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/climate/world-emissions-goals-far-off-course.html) [2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/11/29/carbon/)

&#x200B;

**Climate feedback loops could exponentially accelerate climate change.** 

In addition to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, many disrupted systems can trigger various positive or negative feedbacks within the larger system. [1](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Climate_change_feedback) [2](https://robertscribbler.com/2014/01/21/awakening-the-horrors-of-the-ancient-hothouse-hydrogen-sulfide-in-the-worlds-warming-oceans/) [3](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html) [4](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/melting-arctic-could-supercharge-climate-feedback-20440) [5](https://observer.com/2017/05/scientists-release-climate-change-report-artic-region-unraveling/)

**Biodiversity is falling rapidly.**

The current species extinction rate is 1,000 to 10,000 times greater than the natural background rate. [1](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/) [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03891-1)

World wildlife populations have declined by an average 58% in the past four decades. [1](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37775622)

&#x200B;

**The marginal utility of societal complexity is declining.**

Civilization solves problems via increased societal complexity  (e.g. specialization, political organization, technology, economic relationships). However, each increase in complexity has a declining marginal utility to overall society, until it eventually becomes negative. At such a point, complexity would decrease and a process of collapse or decline would begin, since it becomes more useful to decrease societal complexity than it would be to increase it.

To meet the goals of 0 emissions in 15 years they would:              

Cut jobs.           
Close manufacturing plants.       
Ban cars.           
Ban oil for everything that's possible (manufacturing, transport, chemical production and so on - apart from fertiliser).              
Add buses and nuclear energy, and other green ones.              
Empower police to stop riots by ex-workers.       
Implement a barely-get-by financial allowance for people who no longer have access to the millions of vanished jobs.              
Implement a basic health service now no one is insured.          
Invent CO2 requisition at scale to help lower existing CO2 levels. (410 ppm means no pole ice)              

Then everyone would need to vote for it.

Oh yeah - this needs to happen in every country on earth.

See how getting climate change emissions to 0 in 15 years is entirely and completely impossible without some huge global police state, and dictator willing to thrust the entire population into poverty?

You need to understand that **ALL** the Green initiatives are not working - **CO2 pollution is increasing from the year before MORE than the year before that** - it's not even a steady massive amount each year.

So the bottom line is - prep for collapse.... by that it means having a buffer of supplies to last you the big transition periods required when crops and the economy collapse.

You don't want to be in those early lines for food - they'll be miles long.","2018-11-14 05:34:07","1","12","0.51","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9wx7aa/if_people_were_serious_about_climate_change_theyd/","True","SarahC","1747972958.1705658","green energy transition","manual"
