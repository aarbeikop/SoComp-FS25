EDIT: I turned alarmist around 2015 when I decided, for fun, to read up on climate change - a topic I didn't know much about at the time. Then I did a cursory review of energy trends using mainstream reports and I completely lost my shit. All of the leading countries for climate change were going *backwards*.","2017-07-27 16:02:32","21","[deleted]","1747955539.162047","green energy transition","manual"

Also, global human emissions are [still rising](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data) (third chart). So I'm not sure what you're trying to prove?","2017-07-27 14:34:48","6","goocy","1747955539.1655412","green energy transition","manual"

Easy charts for all available BP energy data on almost every country on earth. Net import, net export, easy to read, for all your energy data needs.

Most of the coal drop on Loki's last chart is in the US, for example, having dropped about by 1/3 since 2008.","2017-07-27 20:46:50","5","Sparkwitch","1747955539.173328","green energy transition","manual"

Probably because it has a theme and isn't just a wall of text and links, well it still sort of is, but if you lay off the hyperbole and angry diatribes, I look forward to reading more of your content.","2017-07-27 23:19:14","4","wostestwillis","1747955539.1751611","green energy transition","manual"
