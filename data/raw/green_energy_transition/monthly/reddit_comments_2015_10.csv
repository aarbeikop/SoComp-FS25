Here is an article you might find interesting that puts in perspective the energy disaster we face.  Essentially the authors point out that the last time humans were in equilibrium with the planet was before the beginning of the agricultural age (~12,000 years ago).  At that point with the population level then, we could easily have existed for 67,000 years on the energy stores and that arriving annually, but today we are down to ~1,000 years worth which will quickly disappear.  We have gobbled up most of the biomass, and face a huge dieoff, if not extinction, as we go after the final dregs.

And finally, if you want to put a timetable on energy collapse, here is an article from some oil engineers pointing out that by 2030 the amount of energy expended to acquire new oil deposits will exceed the energy in the deposits acquired, effectively ending the contribution of oil energy to fuel economic activity.  They do not discuss the resulting collapse of civilization, but the implications seem to be fairly straightforward (pay particular attention to the commentary section):

But that lifestyle can only support maybe 10-100 million people on the planet in total, about what we had prior to 2000 BC but with greater spread across the planet.

3. Trees only provide shade and shelter in temperate regions.  So they have no protective influence over the glaciers, ice caps and above the snow line features that reflect energy back into space.

4. The cold generated by sizable ice caps produce weather patterns that control the gulf stream, a high altitude weather system that has massive regional impacts when changed.  See the east west weather divide in the US.

Admittedly people can and have had massive impacts to forests and jungles but it only takes a couple of hot dry years and they become a tinderbox awaiting a spark.  The end result is more CO2 in that atmosphere and less forest.

> ecosystems are self-regulating phenomena, that aim to create the type of conditions that stabilize their environment

I don't think you should impart a goal or intention to ecosystems. What you have is a series of feedbacks that, given a certain consistent input, *tend* to stabilize. In fact you have you competing forces that mitigate one another. From this you get the concept of resilience, which is the amount of change in the variables in an ecosystem that can occur before you have a certain level of disruption, which can mean an alteration of species, populations, or other factors. A given state of an ecosystem and its relative permanence or the perception of stability is, I would argue, mostly illusory. In most scenarios, species fill their trophic niche to its carrying capacity if not prevented by competition or predation. Alteration to competition factors can create disruptions that chain effects through many other levels, as can many other things, and sometimes those changes are very stark and would be thought of as ""bad"" (think algae blooms for example). I think this is mostly a semantic issue though, and I don't mind terribly the way you put it. I think our impact on ecosystem resilience is one of the most important factors in the natural world that we ignore as a species.

Second, I think your emphasis on old growth and its role in evapotranspiration is a little overstated. Evapotranspiration is obviously a huge factor in the hydrologic cycle, but I have to say that I'm not convinced that in this particular way specifically old growth trees are so much different from any moderately mature forest and that you aren't giving enough credit to all the other vegetation. Your example of tall redwoods is also a little goofy, you might have the sense that the trees are causing rain, but that's a relatively minor micro-environment alteration and isn't really as informative as you seem to think. That's not to say old growth forests aren't important, I firmly believe we should protect as best we can as much of the old growth forest possible, it has immense value as a storehouse for biodiversity and critical habitat (and, for me, beauty, but I try to avoid declarations of my personal values when I discuss these things). I'm all about healthy productive forests.

I think many people recognize the ways in which we stumble. Ecology and our understanding of natural landscapes is improving and there are slow shifts toward an appreciation of the value inherent in the complexity of the systems and for the ""ecosystem services"" they provide (that's actually a term I find annoying). I believe that if we are to find salvation, then we will indeed be the source. I totally agree that it won't be a technological fix, it'll be a cultural shift and it will come with a greater understanding and appreciation for the complexity of life and the systems that gave rise to the natural wealth that we've plundered over the last several centuries (think soil and water). I think that we as humanity are suffering some growing pains at the moment but that it is possible to come out the other side. As a species we are sort of like a human learning how to delay gratification, I think we are maturing slowly but that we are starting to see the consequences of our actions in ways we hadn't seen even a few short decades ago. I don't believe the carrying capacity of the earth is limited to just a couple hundred million people or that 99% of the population will die if we were to practice healthy agriculture, the amount of waste in our food system is truly staggering, though I do think we need to curb population growth.

As far as climate change goes, I don't think anyone has a very good model of how precipitation patterns will change as temps change, it seems to me we may lose as much area that is suitable for forest as we may gain. I personally love forests, it's why I have a degree in forestry. And I love your idea that we might gain more forest across the globe.. but I'm not sure I'm seeing things the way you are when it comes to thoughts that more forests would solve problems that we are attributing to climate change. Forests are at risk from climate change in many places all over the world. Ecosystems will reach tipping points with these changes and the disruption will cause things to transition into states that are hardly recognizable while they move toward a new equilibrium. Losing forest to drought, disease, and insects is just one example of this.

Green Energy in a reduced energy state of living is probably something not entirely bullshit.   The mistake is to think that the status quo can magically be extended by it.  It can't.  It's peoples attachment to the status quo that is fail.

Similarly suburbia and cars are bullshit and unsustainable.

Over in /r/singapore there was soon-to-become ex-pat this week asking about how people managed to own a car since it's so expensive - especially since her idea of ""a necessary car"" was a Caddie Escalade.  She was ""concerned"" about how she was going to get one into SG and operate it.

She was politely informed (well I tried as much I could - others chimed in similarly) of the reality of Singapore (and it's the reality throughout much of Asia) that owning/driving a car isn't even in the realm of normal - public transit is so good in Singapore that it's simply crazy to even consider one, let alone an SUV monster.  And it's a relief to abandon the financial and mental commitment of having a car.  

And places where one must drive, you want a local doing the driving anyway - traffic is too insane and different as are liability laws; but hiring a driver is cheap: Asia has a different prioritization for ""Machine/Energy vs. Human"" labor.  Human labor trumps machines/energy more often than not because of the abundance of the former.  You don't see the mad rush to ""automate"" and ""mechanize"".  There's more often a choice to use human labor for things that are blindly automated in the US out of ideology and greed more than need and social harmony.

I bring this up because she was a perfect example of how people are locked into a singular mindset (especially Americans).  For her the issue was partly familiarity and partly a misunderstanding of safety (apparently she drives an Escalade in the US for personal safety) and partly ignorance of ""most of the world that isn't the US"".  

Yet, again, in much of Asia, it's perfectly safe for a woman to walk the streets in the dead of night or ride public transit, which is an alien experience for the US especially since 9-11.  And most of the assumptions people in the US take for granted are not quite the same: labor vs. energy is a big one.

Hopefully this woman will move to SG and see an alternate reality to the status quo of the US and get a glimmer of the insight needed to see that ""the US way"" is neither the best way nor the only way that works.  Hopefully she'll share that with others when she returns to the US and maybe more will see ""the truth"" of many things currently ignored by willful ignorance.","2015-10-09 16:51:47","13","mantrap2","1747923622.1345642","green energy transition","manual"
