I am okay with 'making stuff' and considered making my own DSSC cells for my roof. I know they are less efficient, but I planned on making a model and seeing how long they might last under extreme UV to try and simulate accelerated aging. (I mean, how long can blackberry juice hold up under the punishment of the sun?)

So, would this be a terrible idea-- can you save me the trouble of wasting a few months and my wife looking at me like I am crazy? (I mean, actually being a nut is bad enough. I don't need my beautiful and wonderful wife's face all screwed up at me for no reason-- takes away from the pleasing aesthetic and derails what could have been more enjoyable dinner conversation...)

I am not opposed to having specialized tools or chemicals/process in my shed away from my house.

The two requirements are that they cost less than commercially produced cells (which seem to be unusually expensive for the materials that go into them). And that they will last 10-15 years.

From there, I should be able to come up with a water tight design, set of steps to create a standard form factor, and the circuitry to patch into a commercial load handler (yeah, I'm not building that myself I can get 5V@???A output from the cells to whatever the input is (a Magnum Energy Inverter per se... they have 12/24V@~100A units like this one http://www.solarelectricsupply.com/solar-components/solar-inverter/magnum/the-ms-series-pure-sine-wave-inverter-charger-ms4024 ).

But, electricity not from fossil fuels is the way forward and I want in sooner than later. Thanks for picking this field and doing this, as ambitious as I am I think my best effort to help is electing people that want to subsidize alternative energy sources...

We used it for lighting mostly, the state of the art was Monocrystalline panels rated at 36 peak watts (But hardly ever saw a true power output of more than 24)

We pretty much monitored the ammeters all the time and two strange phenomena which we observed , and I have no clear idea why they occured.

1) When there was a very thin (alto-cirrus?) wispy cloud layer in the sky, the charging current increased to about 2.8A from a baseline of 2A - approaching the rated output of the panel.

2) When we poured cold water on the panels, the charging current would rise to about 2.6A from a baseline of 2A. The water came from a very cold mountain river, so it would have been at most 15 degrees centigrade. The boost lasted for a few minutes.

I have seen no mention of these effects anywhere in any literature related to solar PV systems

Effect #1 is especially intriguing!

Can you explain why these occurred?
