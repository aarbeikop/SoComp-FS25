Consider that in nature roughly 1 in 10,000 acorns survive to grow into a tree.  The  majority that sprout are eaten by browsers.  So if you are planting native seedlings you must water and protect them from browsers or you will have a vanishingly small survival rate.  Not saying dont.  I'm saying you got to do much more than just plant to  raise a forest.

>Abstract  
>  
>A novel methodology is developed to dynamically assess the energy and material investments required over time to achieve the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources in the electricity sector. The obtained results indicate that a fast transition achieving a 100% renewable electric system globally by 2060 consistent with the Green Growth narrative could decrease the EROI of the energy system from current \~12:1 to \~3:1 by the mid-century, stabilizing thereafter at \~5:1. ***These EROI levels are well below the thresholds identified in the literature required to sustain industrial complex societies.*** Moreover, this transition could drive a substantial re-materialization of the economy, exacerbating risk availability in the future for some minerals. Hence, the results obtained put into question the consistence and viability of the Green Growth narrative.

You don’t even have to buy special wipes; we just cut up some old t-shirts and receiving blankets. A great thing about going the cloth route is there’s a big market for buying and selling them second hand. A good set can last at least 2 babies, if not more, which makes them even better for the environment. We initially weren’t planning on a second baby so we sold ours (which we bought new) for a bit of half what we spent on them. Plus the savings of using them, they’re well worth it. 

As far as food goes, plant based tends to be cheaper. I live in the Midwest in the states and buying in bulk in those types of places isn’t cheaper for most things. Instead, we just buy in the largest package possible that we can eat from and not waste anything. Those packages use less material than buying a bunch of smaller ones. For us, a plant based diet has improved our physical health and saves us on doctor visits and the need for certain medications, too. 

My husband and occasionally toddler do eat some meat. Buying the more sustainable or organic meats are not in our budget so I try to stick to the “manager’s special” meats that are at their sell by date. They’re still plenty good and there’s the potential to save food from going to the trash. Same with marked down produce that’s wrapped in plastic. Some of these can be recycled.","2019-11-02 02:48:50","2","brexvii","1747986244.160382","green energy transition","manual"

Examples:

- We switched to a fully plant based diet. Not only is that one of THE big steps toward sustainability, but it's also a lot more affordable. Animal products are expensive, even more so, if they are in any way, shape, or form less unsustainable or unethical than what you usually get. What's cheaper, a weeks supply of rice, or a weeks supply of beef?

- We buy used clothes almost exclusively. That's a no-brainer. Used clothes from the salvation army or the like are good quality and cheap.
The fashion industry drops is a big fat turd on sustainability efforts every week with that fast-fashion nonsense.
Of course, you can't get everything second hand and you do need to get some items new. I find that most items that are vegan, high quality and without implications of slave labour in asia are reasonably affordable if you consider longevity.

- We strive for a minimalist lifestyle. Mainly, we try to have as few things as possible. Overall that means we consume a lot less, which is both cheaper and better for the environment than the classic western way of living.
I think the sheer amount of worthless junk that we don't buy because we question most of our spendings has quite the impact on our expenses. 

- We buy in bulk and try to avoid packaging as much as possible. I am not sure how much of a financial impact that actually had, tbh, but it sure saves on a lot of garbage.

- We buy more organic and local stuff. That's a mixed bag. Local on farmer's markets is often cheaper than in the supermarket. Organic food items cost more. Not quite sure there. My guess would be that overall it's cheaper if you can get the bulk of your foodstuffs on farmers markets or directly on a farm in your area.

Touching on your seafood question:

You will live in a land-locked state. Seafood will come in a cooled truck. It's organic and from the coast of the UK because that's where the fishery is. Or it's regular stuff but off the west coast. What's better in that scenario? There are a lot of additional questions concerning animal products, especially those with extra complexity like seafood. The ultimate question, in my opinion, should be, as with many other things, 'Do I really need this?'

Know what you're getting and what your priorities are. It is not always cheaper to go plant based. You can source regeneratively raised meat for ~$5/lb. Calorically you're getting more for your money. Eat veggies too but organic veggies can be just as $.","2019-11-02 08:54:30","2","JanetCarol","1747986244.1664279","green energy transition","manual"
"f62icx3","t3_dq6sqm","dq6sqm","sustainability","action-oriented","Consider going plant-based (try r/vegan and vegan recipe subreddits for support, really a good group!).  Just plan on not buying stuff unless you really need the item and then buy it used whenever possible. Walk and cycle as much as possible instead of driving. Most of all disengage from our pathological consumer culture. Seek fulfillment in activities that don't involve consumption or very little consumption.","2019-11-02 02:02:52","1","joez37","1747986244.168143","green energy transition","manual"

Napkins don’t have to be nice, just some cotton ones, mine are black, you can make them match your theme but the point of them is to wipe oil and stains so keep that in mind.
