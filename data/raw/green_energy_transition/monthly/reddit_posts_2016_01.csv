Contrary to what you are repeatedly told, civilization will collapse long before we can effect a 100% renewable energy transition as short-term water, food and energy shortages ignite the collapse of civilization.

What It Means
----------------

Survival is based on low-emissions energy and our survival is not like perusing an energy menu of options we like or dislike.

REALITY

It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6 solar panels.

Electricity production is only 18% of total world energy use.

82% of total world energy use is not electrical generation.

After 20 years, solar-wind energy production is up from 1% to 3% of total world energy use.

Solar-wind power are projected to provide 6% of total energy use by 2030.

It takes 10X as much solar-wind energy to close 1 fossil fuel power plant.

It will take 10 X 18% of total world energy use to close all fossil power plants.

And, it will take 4 X 82% of total world energy use for a 100% wind-solar energy transition.

These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid infrastructure.

Such infrastructure is hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades and additional trillions of dollars.

Solar-wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have to do it all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil sources.

We have to stop carbon emissions at source within current infrastructure constraints at all costs period, exclamation mark. Then we will all have to learn to grow food because...

We will lock-in 2 degree temperature rise in 3 years for 2036 with BAU.

In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.

In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the British Foreign Office.

In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says Scientific American.

In 30 years we won't have enough fossil fuel for a 100% renewable energy transition.

Without massive energy demand destruction renewable energy is unsustainable.

Animal agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we can effect a 100% intermittent energy transition.

Without using Hansen's tax dividends to carbon tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die.

Instead of moving aspirational targets every 5 years, we have to move now, or forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation.

We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 60% of your carbon tax money. This is direct opposition to Hansen's plan and immoral. I strongly believe it should be in a new world e-currency directly deposited to your phone.

We have to close down ranches to reconstruct wildlife corridors, we can't let ranchers take over conservation areas and kill off life.

Top Ten Things You Need To Know
------------------------------

1) You don't need to know ten things.

2) Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

3) Eating meat will destroy our soil and water before we can effect a 100% renewable energy transition.

4) We have no comprehensive, viable, realistic plan to survive this century. We cannot reduce emissions AND have economic growth as you are constantly told.

5) You are being lied to in a very big way, things can go to hell even faster than that because over the next year the pulse of heat from the oceans will initialize a planetary state jump into a new heat energy balance. Arctic methane will heat up the arctic jet stream further to wreak more worldwide havoc for crops. Most of our mega-cities and coastal croplands lie in sacrifice zones where most of the storm and flood damage are due to happen. Think rice paddies in low-land Asia where up to 50% of rice croplands are threatened and where 50% of humanity depend on rice to live.

5) Mega-cities are expected to burst at the seams very quickly as the world's young flee to them. By 2050 80% of humanity will be in cities where 75% of the infra-structure they require does not even exist. And we don't even bother to fix the infrastructure we got now. Putting trillions of dollars worth of flimsy renewable energy infrastructure in places like Dhaka Bangladesh or Miami Florida is a massive misallocation of resources in the new age of Super-Typhoons and Extreme Hurricanes. Renewable energy cannot be brought back on-line after storm damage as quickly as centralized power.

"40pd2x","collapse","skeptical","Post Financial Dystopia","Electricity production is only 18% of total worldwide energy use.

Solar/Wind energy is 3% of total worldwide energy use up from 1% 20 years ago.

A 100% energy transition will take generations to complete not a few decades.

Without massive energy demand destruction in the west,
renewable energy is unsustainable due to water, food and energy shortages.

In 3 years we will lock in 2 degree temperature rise for 2036 with BAU.

In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.

Animal agriculture caused 80% of species extinctions and will destroy our soil and water so fast it will end civilization before we even have a chance at 100% green energy.

"41l9zx","sustainability","action-oriented","green-renewable-sustainable?","Many living at the top of energy consumption pyramid fervently believe there is a green, sustainable, renewable clean energy available for our future.  Much of this belief is founded in the fervent wish to maintain a significant aspect of our present energy way of life.  To foster and support this belief, a couple of parables help us understand how factual this might be.

STREETLIGHT EFFECT
A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, ""This is where the light is.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect

This parable offers several insights.  First the obvious, that we look where it is easiest to see.  But there is I believe a deeper lesson, that we look where we want to see.  

This second parable adds a second dimension to seeing the truth concerning green, sustainable and renewable devices for the future.  


ELEPHANT AND THE BLIND MEN
Once upon a time, there lived six blind men in a village. One day the villagers told them, ""Hey, there is an elephant in the village today.""
They had no idea what an elephant was. They decided, ""Even though we would not be able to see it, let us go and feel it anyway."" All of them went where the elephant was. Everyone of them touched the elephant.
 
""Hey, the elephant is a pillar,"" said the first man who
touched his leg.

""Oh, no! it is like a rope,"" said the second man who touched
the tail.

""Oh, no! it is like a thick branch of a tree,"" said the third man who touched the trunk of the elephant.
""It is like a big hand fan"" said the fourth man who touched the ear of the elephant.
""It is like a huge wall,"" said the fifth man who touched the belly of the elephant.
""It is like a solid pipe,"" Said the sixth man who touched the tusk of the elephant.
They began to argue about the elephant and everyone of them insisted that he was right. It looked like they were getting agitated. A
wise man was passing by and he saw this. He stopped and asked them, ""What is the matter?"" They said, ""We cannot agree to what
the elephant is like."" Each one of them told what he thought the elephant was like. The wise man calmly explained to them, ""All of
you are right. The reason every one of you is telling it differently because each one of you touched the different part of the elephant.
So, actually the elephant has all those features what you all said.""

Clearly a primary lesson of this parable is the need to see the whole picture.

When you look at solar energy collecting devices:


Is this your image?
 

Or do you  imagine this?
 


OR ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS?
 








 



PERHAPS YOU WOULD FIND INTERESTING THE VIDEOS SHOWING 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED TO BUILD THESE DEVICES AT:

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

So what do you think of when you call something green?
Or call something renewable?
Or call something sustainable?
HOW DO YOU DECIDE THAT A DEVICE, A THING HAS THESE QUALITIES?

Grass is green but that is not what you mean, not the color.  Do you mean it doen’t harm the earth?  If so do you see the whole elephant or only look where you want to find the key?

How about renewable?  Do you mean it can create itself?  If so, are you saying it can duplicate itself?  If so, are you talking about all the parts renewing themselves – panels, inverters, controllers, all their internal parts, batteries, wiring and all that is mentioned in the box above.  Does it create itself like a horse or an oak tree?  What do you mean when you say it is renewable?

Sustainable – for how long?  When I plant my garden, part of it I put into clover to build the soil for the following years.  Where do I get the clover?  If I grow it myself, I deplete that soil somewhat when I harvest seed (harvesting with personal or machine energy).  Or do I buy the seed and let someplace else consider how to deal with the depletion?  There simply is no free lunch.
