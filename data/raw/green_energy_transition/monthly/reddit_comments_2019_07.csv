I suspect he’s skeptical of scientific bodies. If he doesn’t accept the science ^[[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/bxgd5p/single_most_important_stat_on_the_planet_alarm_as/eq6bvl0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) ^[[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/bavqn6/researchers_warn_arctic_has_entered_unprecedented/ekefqha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) on climate change, then direct him to the opinion of essentially every bank in the world, including [The World Bank’s ](httpss://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/overview) stance. Even better, insurance companies. Insurance companies utilize the most advanced computer models in the world to maximize their profit based on projections of risk and uncertainty. The insurance industry are the experts in predicting the future, and across the board [they care a lot about how climate change will impact their profit projections.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a27180829/global-warming-is-already-costing-the-insurance-industry-historic-amounts/)  

But. The single most important aspect to get across to him is that *regardless* of climate change, even if it was not part of the equation, if you do not have sustainable production and consumption of energy you have **unsustainable** energy. Meaning the train will keep going but we’re going to run out of track. Fossil fuels are a dead end, and we’re just full smog ahead into a brick wall. 

Oil is a finite resource; the fossil fuel wells will run dry. It is a binary choice our species must face and the laws of physics are clear: a) we transition to sustainable energy, b) complete collapse of society. Those are the only two options possible even if climate change did not exist. The only choice we are left to decide is how quickly we get to sustainable energy.","2019-07-14 00:01:36","16","urunclejack","1747981210.2120378","green energy transition","manual"

Wigley and his co-authors find that completely renewable-energy proposals lack feasibility, but that net zero carbon emissions are possible with nuclear power. 

Your paper will fall short because those are the same findings of other papers, like Clack, et al, who debunked Jacobson's all-renewables paper.

Your premise is entirely wrong. The authors of the papers I am citing don't want to prolong fossil fuels. They are just noting that it can't be done without nuclear power.","2019-07-14 14:32:25","3","Will_Power","1747981210.2241678","green energy transition","manual"

100% renewables on an electricity grid indeed seems impossible in the current ways of the system.

I see it however as possible to reach you just need industries that have flexibility over their power use so when there is too much demand they will have to power down and be compensated for this.

On the other side if you want an 100% clean grid you want industry to be able to handle green energy surges and hold it in preheating or batch processes (making ammonia from n2 gas could help with these surges for instance).","2019-07-14 10:49:21","2","ask_me_science","1747981210.2262259","green energy transition","manual"

someone already mentioned that there are other things to consider first before alternative energy (reduce energy use before offsetting it). Definitely correct. Even something like basic attic weatherization can play a huge part but only if you're in the right climate. Lights and low flow shower and faucet fixtures are some of the easiest upgrades you can do yourself with the fastest payback. 

Something to consider when looking at homes is if they have a HERS rating OR have anything related to energy use in the appraisal or listing. There are green trainings your realtor can get so they can identify which home are more energy efficient. I'd at least ask if you are using a realtor. You may see some are Energy Star rated or have another third party certification, which are generally better because they had 3rd party inspections for energy and durability items during construction. 

For outdoor - if you can stay away from big lawns that is best. They take a lot of water, energy (mowing) and chemicals to take care of. Green building rating systems nowadays give points for reduced lawn square footage (unless it is a drought-tolerant species). But you may want a nice lawn, so you have to pick what you like and take the trade-offs.","2019-07-01 21:25:11","3","Jumpin_Joeronimo","1747981929.573778","green energy transition","manual"

"etr0pff","t3_c7wqsb","c7wqsb","sustainability","action-oriented","Rough location and/or climate is pretty critical for getting general suggestions. Especially for homesteading-type stuff, information handed out in South America will be totally different from that in Norway. 

Off-grid is great but depending on the house, property, and jurisdiction, might be a non-starter. At only 15 minutes out from “a bigger city” (how big?) you could run into bullshit zoning restrictions, especially on such a small parcel of land. (South of where I live, 10 acres is considered the minimum for most animals.) Also not a lot of opportunities for a good wood lot, which I strongly recommend if you want to go down this path! 

Solar and wind generation are great for off-grid setups, but since you’re talking about an existing house, consider the power makeup where you wind up moving. Where I live the grid is 100% carbon-free outside of peak hours. Other parts of my country use almost entirely hydroelectric power. It doesn’t make economic or environmental sense for me to make my own system since my house is already connected. And, don’t forget, a lot of off-grid places turn to propane appliances for stuff like DHW and drying clothes in the winter. If you’re in a part of the world that still believes it’s the 1800s and coal is viewed as an economic driver, and not a sloppy form of suicide, your situation may be different :) On the other hand, if you get a big ol’ farmhouse that is heated by fossil fuels, it might more sense to invest your time and money into insulation, renewable heating, and lowering your power consumption. Situations can be very different! I moved into my place with similar thoughts, but I realized that the previous owners went through half a tank of heating oil and like an entire forest of wood every month in the winter! I’ve spent a little bit of time working on reducing power consumption, but much more on insulation and stopping air leakage. Last season I think I burned 100L of heating oil, simply due to crappy timing with cold weather and not having a fire in the outdoor boiler, and I’ve reduced firewood consumption significantly. Before the next season I hope the oil burner will be there only because I’m too lazy to remove it, not because it gets used.

Chickens are fun. Rabbits are, too. They eat grass and crap out fertilizer. Both are pretty low-maintenance and low-impact animals and very easy to integrate into permaculture systems IMHO. Plus they’re great in a curry or stir-fry.

"eudb8s1","t3_cfnrpx","cfnrpx","sustainability","action-oriented","I would say the single largest problem with IT in general is the disposable culture. We replace perfectly good devices constantly for no good reason. This is more of a problem for consumers than on the networking side, where equipment spends a lot time installed or otherwise has a good reason to be replaced.

On the consumer end of things, lazy programming is driving pollution and climate change. Planned obsolescence from companies like Apple is well established as an issue, but think about the average desktop application. How much more productive is the average word processor user today versus twenty years ago? We had leaps and bounds with GUI technology and graphics processing and additional memory for nice-to-haves like spell check, but then what? How much pollution has been created simply in the name of being ""up-to-date"", but not actually getting more things done? ""Wintel"" used to be a derogatory term for PCs back in the '90s but it also referred to the idea of collusion between Microsoft and Intel. The basic idea is that new versions of software are slower, so people buy new faster computers, which allows them to make software slower again, driving sales for new computers... Really, what is wrong with Windows XP other than some security problems? Windows 98? Well they don't support the latest features and formats. You don't need 8 GB RAM and a quad core processor to parse OOXML or have security features underneath that SELinux can accomplish on a 486. It's bloat, plain and simple.

Web developers are some of the worst (both people writing web pages and people writing the browsers). Google started out on a mission of speed and simplicity. In 1998 it was very strange to have a search engine home page that was a plain white screen. It was FAST, and any piece of crap could use it. Today Chrome uses like 2 GB of RAM on a blank tab. You can't use old computers anymore.

*In 2019 a ten year-old machine barely has enough power to display a blank page.*

But, more related to your preferred focus, Cloud = Coal.

https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/there-are-no-clean-clouds/420744/

https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/opinions/power-consumption-data-centers-global-problem/

This directly ties into your focus of networking and IoT.

Already we are seeing very small useful life periods for these devices as there are so many companies making these things that they disappear almost as fast as they show up. Consequently security updates are rare. The solution? *Throw out the old one and buy another.* The IoT-style devices which are essentially peripherals push all of their data to be processed elsewhere are directly contributing to climate change. Every time you ask your Amazon Echo ""Hey Alexa..."", you're burning coal somewhere far away. Aside from the energy use, people don't see the immense amounts of gear these facilities go through, which brings us back to the damage done by manufacturing new hardware constantly. These convenience devices make problems out of sight, out of mind, and their environmental impact is no exception.

Hopefully that gives you a few ideas? I apologize that this may seem like more of a rant than an inspirational ""how can I use some technology to make the world a better place?"" tale that is endlessly lampooned by the like of HBO's Silicon Valley. The reality is that we have have a lot of problems to solve that were created by technologies we developed to solve other problems.
