"db9pkp6","t3_5in9jk","5in9jk","collapse","skeptical","Thanks for the reflection. I really believe that our culture is accelerating our demise. Culture is persuasive because it has the huge benefit of tradition - there is compelling evidence that this way of life is correct because it has worked for our ancestors.

This ""culture / tradition"" heuristic is bad when it comes to regular collapse of civilization, because it's maladaptive to massive changes. But with regular collapse, there's still a working ecosphere around the crumbling civilization that can be relied on for survival. We won't have that last safety net, and we need to learn from our collective past mistakes and invent something entirely new.

Note that I'm not talking about possibilities or solutions or hope, I'm talking about the absolute neccessity to adapt to a fatal predicament. Even if we manage to find the correct way to adapt, billions of people and thousands of species will die anyways. I am a [long descentist](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4347496-the-long-descent), but I don't agree with JMG's timescale. We won't have another 3 to 5 centuries to collapse, because climate change will make survival literally impossible in the meantime. Don't feel safe on a remote piece of land - if people are hungry and you have food, they will find and kill you. 7 billion people means 122 people for every square mile of the earth, searching, killing and eating endlessly for years and for decades. They - we, actually - will find every bunker, every buried stash. We're resourceful, we're desperate and we have kids to feed. So if we don't find a way to adapt that *also* reduces climate change, we'll follow the path of [St Matthew's Island](http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/comics_en/st-matthew-island/) and we'll overshoot within a decade or two. In that case, humans are in all likelihood going to be extinct by the year 2200 (mainly because of a slow collapse of the topsoil, preventing food to grow).

Also, I'm actually crazy enough to keep searching for a realistic way for humans to adapt to this upcoming catastrophe. I know both technology and economy only offer misleading garden paths. Maybe a viable path can be found in culture. The chances are ridiculously small, I have all of human history stacked against me and I'm not an anthropologist, so I don't even have a professional idea how culture works. Yet, I'm trying to carve out a new piece of culture that has never been tried before, that hasn't been tested in the real world for decades, and that may have psychological flaws or feedback loops that will cause it to collapse faster than the surrounding world.

Why? Because everyone else who saw this whole predicament has given up on sight. I asked friends once what they would do if the run-down nuclear reactor in our region (50 miles away) had a catastrophic meltdown. They said that this would be a good reason to commit suicide. I was shocked. People are fragile, and once this whole thing is coming down there won't be any cool heads spending hours on message boards, thinking about best practices and about interactions between economy, culture, energy and ecology. We need to come up with a plan before it's too late, and that means before collapse is becoming mainstream.

I'd be honored if you want to join this planning stage. I also understand if you'd prefer to give up instead. Whatever you do, don't have kids. In all likelihood, they're going to starve.","2016-12-16 14:23:22","10","goocy","1747948210.864406","green energy transition","manual"

No.

That's not the way it works. Not at all.

We've diverted a small portion of the energy we derive from burning fossil fuels as fast as we possibly can (I do think it is in many ways an end in itself - the shiny, plastic crap we seem to prize so highly is just some sort of byproduct - a token that validates our raw consumption,) into building some renewablez, but they're (seemingly deliberately) designed to be short-lived, even in operation are often reliant on regular (if not continual,) fossil fuel inputs, and will all wear out in a couple of decades anyway and need to be replaced with another round of (even more) expensive fossil fuel inputs and resource raping (if that's even still possible then.)

This will just give them one more excuse to keep the fossil fuels burning for longer.

The true solution is unappealing, but simply this:

Stop. Burning. Shit. Now.

All of it. Just stop.

Learn to live with less.

> The remarkable pace of innovation will have at least some effect on the shape and size of our carbon pulse – I do hope it is to the good.

Sadly it won't be, and can't be. It is precisely the ""remarkable pace of innovation"" and our incontinent industriousness that drives the destruction.

The only way out of this madness is to just stop doing this crazy shit. We should have stopped doing this crazy shit centuries ago (when we still could have without killing us all,) but we didn't.

But that's not going to happen until reality forces us to, because now we've ratcheted ourselves so far up the progress ladder, that we recognise that a fall from this height would kill us all (or at least a sufficiently huge proportion of us to make provoking collapse an unappealing prospect for the majority of sheeple,) and make life a good deal less comfortable for any survivors.

No, technology and progress and growth are not, and never will be the solution. They are the very crux of the problem, and the more of them we get, the fuckeder we inevitably become (and with us, all other life on this once magnificent planet.)

It is only fudging or discounting the costs and energy flows of our technological society that permits this delusion to persist that somehow we can beat the laws of thermodynamics.

"dap0cai","t3_5fyv44","5fyv44","collapse","skeptical",">We are doing much about it. Our eleventh-hour fight against our CO2 emissions, while predictably late, is still massive and commendable. Science has laid bare the consequences, and politicians have finally listened. You may find the policy changes meagre, but they matter and they will grow. Also, we can’t deny that we’ve had a pulse of innovation including efficient and cheap renewable energy, power reduction of appliances, electric cars, “sustainable” building materials, and so on. It’s not enough to stop the warming, but it’s not bad.

This is just not factual at all, it is just hopium and speculation at best. There is no incentive for countries to stop deforestation, mineral mining, intensive agriculture and animal farming. The problem is not global warming because as you said those consequences are far away. The problem will be running out of fresh water sources and fertile soil, running out of oil and precious minerals to build solar panels and the such, also no oil=no infraestructure as a whole. Besides, the third world will continue to develop and increase its footprint and even if the developed countries suddenly become ""green"" (There is no such thing) the carbon footprint will be inherited by South America, India, etc. Sorry to break it to you, but there will be no miracle leapfrogging into clean energy.

I'd recommend you take a look at these articles. Renewables are a fantasy, as well as any form of sustainable development. The only way for us to stop being the cancer of our planet would be to ditch civilization as a whole.

Yes, microbes and simpler metazoans do control the bulk of the Biosphere and may have caused seven or eight of the largest mass extinctions. But lacking intelligence and consciousness, at least they were not smug and dismissive about it.

>Four: Earth's life will carry on

Well excuse me for being ~~sentimental~~ nostalgic for this version of the Biosphere.

So, you think you can guarantee the survival of a few dozen vertebrate species. Well, at least all of them are edible, and ingredients in established cuisines.

Yeah, what did posterity ever do for me.

> Thirteen through Eighteen

You seem to have no real conception of the scale, acceleration, or persistence of the catastrophe we face. 

>Forty Scientists need to scare people.

Sounds like Michael Crichton. No, scaring people is a quick path to professional suicide and even public ridicule, when your dire predictions fail to occur. The bias of scientists and engineers is to exaggerate the positive - synthesizing carbon nanotubes from atmospheric CO2, bio-engineering an improve photosynthesis, mining asteroids. File those away with the thousands of 'cures of cancer' that have been reported for decades. 


> All Fifty

Note to other essayists: to avoid composing so much twaddle, it is best not to set some arbitrary number for reasons for optimism. Are there really *Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover* or *Fifty Shades of Grey*?

Once, when expounding my grim views of the human prospect on another Reddit site, I encountered a very thoughtful young person, who having just discovered the enormity of the approaching catastrophe, spoke of the futility of his life. Taken aback, I felt obligated to console (Me!) this person - you bear no personal responsibility for this, so back away from the subject, go on with your life, seek out the things that give you comfort, and try to make what meaningful contribution you can.
