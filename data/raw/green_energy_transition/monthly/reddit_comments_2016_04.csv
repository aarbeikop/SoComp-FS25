But now I find myself working along side many brilliant people with masters degrees who are not making anymore money then me and are burned out from the long hours and poor pay of graduate school.

Biofuels: Has anyone ever done a serious carbon footprint of various bio-based fuels and whether they can be made sustainably? I bring up corn ethanol as the obvious detraction, people claim more diesel and natural gas is burned to fertilize, harvest, and process ethanol than it displaces in petroleum. Has someone actually crunched the numbers? How about cellulosic ethanol?

Bioplastics - is there any technology you see actually making a cost effective penetration? My primary interest is packaging as that is the most wasteful form. Are you seeing biodegradable (compostible) technology or recyclable technology working best? 

Biochemicals - is there still serious demand for this in light of inexpensive oil (which is not going anywhere soon), or is everything still driven by price? I see a lot of work on biobased reactants that eventually behave like the petroleum based equivalents (say succinic acid for polyesters), is there still a lot of focus on this or not (instead looking for environmentally friendly polymers)?
