It is a problem that humans don’t have the power to solve unless very impractical and drastic measures are taken. Like I understand that the climate is changing but no shit it’ll change. That’s nature. Majority of the people in the world don’t have the time, energy or resources to think about saving the Earth because they’re thinking about how they’re gonna feed their families and quench their thirst.

I get that Humans now have some input in that changing climate but there’s nothing that can be done to “reverse” it.  The population of the Earth is going up so fast and you can’t really control that. More people = more environmental stress on Earth = more climate change. 

The earths climate has been on a roller coaster. Periods that were much hotter than this, periods that were much colder than this. And everything in the middle. And it will continue to change because that’s what nature is. Nothing is ever constant or “perfect”. 

All climate change activists do is spread awareness that climate change is real. Which I completely agree, but they never come up with real solutions.","2019-12-30 06:21:12","0","17","0.29","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ehiatn/my_two_cents_on_climate_change/","True","TerribleTackle","1747986614.3372319","green energy transition","manual"
"ehcms0","climatechange","action-oriented","Climate Change made easy 8)","The earth and humans are quite similar.

The earth is a fine tuned self regulating machine just like the human body.  Both of them can take a lot of abuse before getting sick.

The earth is getting sick here is why.

Us little humans critters, 7.5 billion of us and counting are crawling all over her.  She can handle that pretty well except the Co2 problem is making her sick.

The earth has a tremendous amount of stored energy coal, oil and natural gas in her belly.  Well us crafty humans critters figured out that if we drill and mine her belly we can use this stuff to power factories, cars, jets, homes etc, fantastic.

Well there is a problem, in all that coal, oil and gas is a blast from the past.  Forest, plants and animals that got buried and smashed for millions of years turns naturally into fossil stuff like lumps of coal and sticky oil.

But what people dont know is that when all the plants were alive they absorbed, grabbed, tackled, hugged and stored Co2 by the mega super load.

So when the little squeeky human critters figured out they could burn this and turn it into power they went happy crazy.

The problem is, when these fossil fuels are burnt the carbon atom pops out into the air like a wet soap bar out of ur hands in the shower.  It floats into the atmosphere and stays there for a long long time.  

You will here it explained like this, “there is umpteen giggly mega super metric tonnes of Carbon in the atmosphere”.  Us human critters minds and eyes glaze over, can’t comprehend it, me either.

So here is what happens.  The Co2 atoms are side by side and bend and lock arms to form a coat/blanket over the earth.  Like if we are to wear a clear plastic bag over us what happens. We get sticky and hot. The earth is the same. 

When the sun rays hit the earth a lot ricochets right back up to outter space especially off of clouds of frozen sea ice. But the Co2 is like a clear plastic bag over the earth that holds all that ricocheded sunlight energy in.   Like a green house does, that is where they coined the term “green house effect”.

That clear plastic bag of Co2 also has a double whammy effect.  Co2 is one of the only gasses that stores the suns energy.  It also holds more moisture.  This is bad because it means more bigger and badder storms/tornadoes etc.

So whats the big deal if the earth warms a little?  To us human critters playing outside not much.  To the Earth, it’s a big deal.

How do u feel when ur running a temperature but feel cold.   U feel whack a doodled and dont like it.  Or when you wake up sticky and hot and whip off the blankets, AAAHHH.  The earth can’t do that.

Before the earth was just spinning round enjoying the view, doing normal weather like when we were a kid.

Well the earth cant do that anymore cause she has the Co2 plastic bag wrapped around her.  And she is getting hotter and that pushes weather currents/jet streams etc around causing irregular weather.  Like today, Chicagoland weather is 60 degrees again.  The second time in late December, (warning sssshhh).

People wonder, well doesn’t the smart earth have some way to capture Co2 and cool itself?  She sure does but us little human critters is messing that up as well.  Its called trees and oceans.

The little human critters are burning down the rain forest that stood for millions of years, burning it down at record rates and smilin ear to ear.  That is a double whammy there.  Trees capture and store Co2 which are now gone.  And when trees are burnt it releases the giggly mega tonnes of Co2 in the atmosphere. 

Not to mention the smell of burnt fur from forest animals that can’t escape like the cute koala bears. They fall to the forest floor legs up and look like a toasted black chicken in your oven.

The oceans, are huge massive heat exchangers for the earth..... Buuuuut, u guessed it, Co2 is messing that up to.

Oceans are like humans and plants.  U probably heard that plants like and only live in a certain pH level.  pH is the certain level of acidic or alkaline that we need to live in.   In simple terms, it is the tasty zone that u like/need to live in.  If us human critters pH is out of whack in our bodies, we are a sick puppies.

Co2 is absorbed by the oceans in a natural process, but when it is force fed Co2 it changes the oceans very sensitive pH level. Which is killing coral reefs at an alarming rate.  Which causes species extinctions and disrupts the oceans entire food chain. Note, one billion people survive off of the ocean.

How much disruption is too much?  Time will tell, it’s like how many jenga blocks/species can be removed/extinct before it gets tipsy turvy and collapses???? WE, U, me, kids, gkids don’t want to find out.

I just scratched the tip of the melting ice berg, so to speak.  The world is so simple, but enormously complex, it is unreal.  And WE human critters have our heads shoulder deep in the sand.  For what?  Why can’t we take off our blinders and think ahead for our kids an gkids?

One thing for sure.  If we pull our heads out of the sand, shake like a dog and let the sand go flying.....

We can turn climate change around.  Like a lot of things, climate change is PREVENTABLE!","2019-12-29 22:28:43","0","10","0.45","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ehcms0/climate_change_made_easy_8/","True","walcron","1747986631.069469","green energy transition","manual"
"ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Ideas to be more environmentally friendly","I've always considered myself to be eco conscious but I am currently reading 'The Uninhabitable Earth' and its spurred me to make bigger life changes for 2020 🙌 Next year I want to do MORE to reduce my impact on the Earth 🌍 I already do the following...

• I recycle and compost

• I travel by public transport (I don't have a car)

• I always bring my own bags to the supermarket 

• I donate to green initiatives

• I vote for political parties that consider the climate emergency

• I use eco friendly, fragrance free washing up liquid and laundry detergent 

• I visit a zero waste shop to refill the above products

• I use reusable make up removal pads, sanitary wear, bamboo toothbrush etc 

• I am a strict vegetarian 

• I go litter picking 

• I pay to offset my carbon emissions each time I fly (not a frequent flyer)

• I avoid palm oil

• I frequently buy second hand clothing (90% of my wardrobe is eBay/depop)

• I am savvy with my water and energy usage within my home 

• I (gently) educate my family on environmental issues, as they are less clued up on Earth's impending doom!
