"dlfhvka","t3_6st7fr","6st7fr","science","scientific","Hi, thanks for your AMA. I read your paper and thing the framework looks promising and relatively simple to apply. In the section on Energy Efficiency, you noted:

>Addressing the reality that energy used
(e.g., kilowatt-hours, Megajoules, therms) in the production of
a chemical is not commonly measured, P6-GCM estimates
energy impact by calculating the amount of reaction time that
synthesis steps deviate from ambient pressure (i.e., atmospheric
pressure at sea level or 1 atm) and ambient temperature (i.e.,
room temperature or 25 °C)

Energy use in the chemical industry is huge (about [29% of all energy used in US manufacturing](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/manufacturing/briefs/chemical/)) and your observation that it is rarely measured is an apt one. But I think we can do a better job estimating that energy use. Am I mistaken that by focusing on the chemical steps your analysis fails to take into account another (possibly [THE](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/manufacturing/briefs/chemical/#fig5chart)) major use of energy the chemical industry: distillation? Firing boilers for separations and heating reactors for solvent-changes consume large amounts of energy and represent large chunks of additional time holding a reactor at elevated temperature or reduced pressure. Considering the enthalpies of vaporization of the solvents used or compounds distilled would give you a floor to the energies required for such a process.","2017-08-10 15:37:58","8","dungeonsandderp","1747956416.922406","green energy transition","manual"

"dlffwor","t3_6st7fr","6st7fr","science","scientific","I have a question about the relativity of how green certain chemicals are. 

I am aware that chlorofluorocarbons are extremely damaging to the ozone layer and as a result have been replaced by the slightly better hydrochlorofluorocarbons and the best replacement hydrofluorocarbons (as well as propane butene blends for coolants I believe). I would assume that CFCs & HCFCs would be very 'non-green' chemicals and HFCs more so. However some HFCs are still considered a greenhouse gas yet are in wide use as they are a suitable replacement.

So my question is, does your rating system factor in all the different ways a chemical can pollute the environment? And does it account for the fact that some chemicals are the best replacement we have and are therefore the 'greenest' chemical for their specific use?

"dlfjaur","t3_6st7fr","6st7fr","science","scientific","Hello and thank you for taking the time to share this and answer questions. One of the hardest things to determine for me as a consumer is the efficacy of various green products. I know that I have purchased greener alternatives on a number of occasions that worked so terribly I had serious buyers remorse and wished I had gone for the less green original. 

To me this is a serious problem because I WANT to be green(er) but if being green means a higher cost to me i.e. the product (say a paint solvent) cost 125% of the original AND requires 300% additional labor then the actual cost is 425% of the original. 

I will generally engage in the greener alternative anyway out of moral concerns BUT here's the rub. I often hear other consumers complain that they won't buy 'that green shi*' because it doesn't work. I think that creates a fundamental trust issue where 'green' translates to 'doesn't work' 

I appreciate the work that you're doing and I hope that it has it's intended impact. Sincerely.

"dlfjc00","t3_6st7fr","6st7fr","science","scientific","Hello Dr. Murray and Dr. Ponnusamy,

I am a process development chemist in the early stages of my career and a self-proclaimed proponent of green chemistry, so I am happy to see that the movement now has a quantitative way to go about comparing the cleanliness of most processes. I have two questions that deal more generally with green chemistry.

&nbsp;

First, in my dealings with other scientists and management thus far, almost all are *conceptually* committed to the concepts of green chemistry and sustainable practices. However, this is almost never incorporated in to the decision-making when it actually comes down to it; close to 100% of the time the Mitsonobus/TBTU couplings/Stille couplings in DCM or ethers will be chosen over months of paying someone like me to develop a cleaner process that still might not give as high yield and certainly won't be as cost-efficient. In your eyes, what is the long-term solution to actually changing the behavior of chemists and managers to pursue and implement green processes?

&nbsp;

Finally, do you have any opinion on the cGMP guideline which requires recovered solvents to only be used in the process that they were recovered from? It seems to be a guideline that not only discourages the recovery of solvent (as opposed to simply burning it for energy or discarding it so that you don't have to worry about the labor of purifying it) but is not grounded in any chemical principle at all. A solvent with a purity profile that fits the parameters of the reaction should be adequate, no matter the source.","2017-08-10 16:02:57","6","pleasetouchmygrundle","1747956416.937666","green energy transition","manual"

I have a couple of questions if that is okay:

Rapid assessment is a major focus in the LCA/TEA community currently, with a focus on developing streamlined but reliable & replicable methods for analysis. 

Do you see DOZN as a tool that can provide such analysis?

You speak of using a broader data set than that used in an LCA, how do you quantify the qualitative factors? How can you ensure that this doesn't allow for bias when used by others?

I have a couple questions:

1) Do you expect this approach being eventually modified to support chemists to estimate greeness during product development? In a way making estimates from the lab on what the performance of the product will be in production?
 
2) While the application of a ranking facilitates decision making, do you think this could potentially lead to misinterpretations and misuse of results by companies?

3) with this method companies can set system boundaries based on data availability, how effective do you think the method is in conveying data gaps, analytical choices and assumptions? 

4) One much discussed topic in LCA is uncertainty. This method doesn't seem to account for that. What is your opinion on the inclusion or exclusion of uncertainties?

5) Have you already identified potential case studies that you would like to work on to compare LCA to this method?
