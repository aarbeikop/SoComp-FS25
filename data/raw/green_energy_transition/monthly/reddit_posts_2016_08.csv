"4zppci","environment","emotional","What type of things can I realistically do to slow climate change?","I'm 17, ever since I was 13 I was an environmentalist, I've always cared about the environment. But I feel completely helpless. These cooperate giants all ignore climate change and influence it heavily. One of the potential U.S candidates doesn't even recognize climate change's existence and is actually proposing cutting funding for it. Australia's government getting millions of letters and emails asking to acknowledge it and they still don't give a shit. It's really hard to feel like I can do anything besides tell people and then watch them shrug like morons. I've recycled for a long time so that's something. I'm also thinking about going vegan to prevent agriculture emissions. But I'm going to be getting my own place soon so I'll be able to directly effect how I live. So what are some things that I can realistically do to help make real change? And if there isn't anything then what are some things I can do at my house to help?
