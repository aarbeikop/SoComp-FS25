"dwmkwv4","t3_88q8my","88q8my","environment","emotional","Not going to comment on anything else, but as far as burning trees for renewable energy, it's as renewable as it gets. Every gram of carbon that comes out was captured from the air in the last 50-100 years. And it makes land available for more trees. As long as they are planting new trees at the same rate, it's much better than burning any other fossil fuel from a carbon perspective. I would imagine it's better from a sulfur perspective as well.","2018-04-01 14:03:51","2","frothface","1747965054.042913","green energy transition","manual"

"dxkpmqy","t3_8d6847","8d6847","collapse","skeptical","We have the science and information to act. People have bits and pieces of information. But overall, the mass media is feeding people infotainment and propaganda.

The problem is capitalism -- addressing global warming will make some capitalists rich, and some of the existing rich capitalists will have to change or they'll lose money. Naomi Klein brilliantly makes this point, that the problem is capitalism.

But since capitalism is untouchable according to our 2 ruling parties, nothing is done and the mass media continues to feed us infotainment while they refuse to put the severity of the problem in context so we can force changes to be enacted.

Perhaps there has been decline in some areas that are not so well surveyed but at least some areas have seen their phytoplankton populations rise.

Combine assets in derivatives? Options pricing or CFD creation? Asset tracking and income monitoring? Develop methods for optimal decision making under uncertainty? Forecasting/forecast assesment?

Would you like to drive the shift to renewables, or are you more comfortable handling business as the second on the path, expanding a frontier into a large operation?

Where are you located? What are your options and preferences in terms of geography? Are you a fresh graduate or do you have some work experience?

There's a huge variety of options in field for a finance guy, but I don't know your specific speciality well enough to give advice based on your post (I come at it from the engineering side). What are you particularly good at?

"dx8d6kv","t3_8bky89","8bky89","renewable","action-oriented","I work in the energy engineering and green financing field in the US.  There are plenty of opportunities for someone who wants to be involved in renewables in a financial manner.

For starters, there are programs such as PACE which deals with funding of energy projects.  There is also a big field of energy savings performance contracting which is for federal facilities and basically let's them finance projects from the expected energy savings.  Add to that the various rebate and grant programs that require financial guys to work on alongside the engineers.  

There is also the investment side of things where you can work for an investment fund and help determine the best avenue of investment in renewables or energy efficiency companies.

Finally, there is a whole field of due diligence regarding commercial real estate transactions.  There are a whole bunch of green programs that are being incorporated as part of the more standard inspections.  This is the area in which I now work as Director of Green & Energy Services for a commercial real estate transactional services company.
