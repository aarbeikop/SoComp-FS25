"bhlbub","climatechange","action-oriented","More trees or more wind mils/sun collectors","I was discussing this with my friends. I said it would be good for climate to have more trees. Since they clean the air. But they said that it's important to have more green energy. But to get more green energy you need more space. And so you sacrifice trees. 

Now I'm wondering what's better to solve climate change.","2019-04-26 11:40:24","2","11","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bhlbub/more_trees_or_more_wind_milssun_collectors/","True","AxelDePlaxel","1747977997.049637","green energy transition","manual"
"bbiot3","climatechange","action-oriented","What might things be like after carbon drawdown?","Sorry if this has already been asked or if this ain’t the right place to ask or whatnot...

I’d better preface this by saying I know there’s not an overwhelming amount of hope and I’m personally not very optimistic. But we hear a lot about what kind of weather events and other repurcussions we’ll see more of with x degrees, so I was wondering what kind of world we could expect if global coordinated efforts did switch to green energy and invest in heavy use of carbon capture technology and ultimately reduce atmospheric carbon to safe levels. How long would extreme weather carry on? Would there be a mini ice age? Would the sudden loss of carbon from the air do anything weird? Sorry to sound dumb but I’m not a scientist or a meteorologist or anything like that. I’d be interested to know if anyone has seen any theories about this. I don’t suppose things will just “go back to normal” but it’d be cool to get an idea.","2019-04-10 06:19:50","5","10","0.7","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bbiot3/what_might_things_be_like_after_carbon_drawdown/","True","123mspire","1747977998.38995","green energy transition","manual"
"bhus28","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","What to put on a handout sheet?","So I'm fortunate enough to work in a job where I can talk to small groups of people everyday about a topic more or less having to do with nature and the environment. 

I'm trying to put together a paper hand out I can give to people to spread awareness about global warming and what they can do to shrink their carbon footprint.

To save on resources (paper, ink) I'm limiting the handouts to what I can put on a 1/4 or 1/2 sheet of paper. 

On ONE SIDE, I have the typical ways of shrinking your foot print:

>Eat less meat  
Use less plastic  
Consume less  
Buy used where possible  
Refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, recycle, rot  
Drive less - walk, bike, carpool, take public transit  
Avoid flying by plane  
Buy locally  
Compost green waste  
Plant a tree or ten (native species)  
Wash clothes in cold water/hang dry  
Use less electricity  
Donate to environmental causes    
Research and spread awareness  
Talk to your representatives about renewables and vote

But I'm lost on what exactly I can put on the other side of the sheet, info wise.

I work in government, so I can't really come at it from too biased of an angle (""Vote dem/green!""), and it has to be professional. (I might be able to talk a little about Greta Thunberg, but not necessarily Extinction Rebellion, for example.)

Ideas? Maybe some credible websites, list some documentaries to watch, some social media hashtags? But which? As much as I LOVE me some good graphics, I want to keep them to a minimum because the 1/4-1/2 size page limit.","2019-04-27 02:53:34","3","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/bhus28/what_to_put_on_a_handout_sheet/","True","rezkidsinlove","1747978065.4981198","green energy transition","manual"

Communities, particularly those at the intersection of different forms of marginalization and oppression, are shouldering the burdens of climate change and environmental pollution of all kinds. Eighty percent of Latinos live in areas that do not meet EPA standards for air quality, and sixty-eight percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal plant. This leads to higher rates of asthma, cancer, pollution-related disease in vulnerable communities, as well as devastating impacts on the climate at large.   


The disproportionate impacts of environmental pollution are already taking a toll on our communities, which are having to shoulder immense costs. By putting a price on carbon emissions, we are able to shift that burden back to the polluters, who are responsible, and ensure our communities are better served through much-needed investments.   


Ensuring however, that policy design is intentional and deliberate in taking an equity lens seriously will require work. It is imperative that we are inclusive and bring the voices of those on the frontlines of these issues to the center of our movement.   


Join us to help tackle some of these questions on our upcoming webinar featuring our very own Maria Virginia Olano, host of the Cooler Earth podcast and Michelle Romero, the National Director of Green For All. Green For All is a climate justice organization that advances solutions that bring clean energy, green jobs and opportunities to the poorest, and most polluted communities in the country, and we're so excited for Michelle's insight in this conversation.","2019-04-18 19:03:44","1","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bepdli/webinar_the_role_of_carbon_pricing_in_a_just/","True","noadalzell","1747978095.2475898","green energy transition","manual"
"b91hql","science","scientific","Science discussion series: We are an interdisciplinary group of water science professionals and we’re here to discuss safe drinking water. Ask us anything!","[Hi Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png)! Today's discussion is coming to us from the [**National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)**](http://www.nationalacademies.org/) and is a collaboration between r/science, [**LabX**](https://labx.org/), and [**the Water, Science and Technology Board**](http://dels.nas.edu/wstb)! 

## We are panel of diverse water science professionals ready to answer your questions about all things related to drinking water. 

Water is a ubiquitous phenomenon! But its visual abundance—from its constant flow out of taps and fountains to the immensity of our oceans—can mask the fact that 1 in 7 people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water (that’s over 1 billion people!). Furthermore, in places like New Orleans or The Netherlands, water can seem like an impending threat without the proper means to safely contain it, or productively incorporate it into our daily lives. The broader water/society interface raises questions about drinking water’s vulnerability to climate change and society’s vulnerability to ageing infrastructure for adequate and safe sourcing, treatment, and distribution. Poor drinking water quality can result from pollution from sources such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, corrosion of lead from distribution pipes, or treatment facility contamination by man-made materials such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Emerging innovations in grey/green infrastructure, stewardship programs to reduce man-made contaminants, desalination technology, and international efforts to increase access to safe water on a global scale might help preserve and increase Earth’s water supply and society’s value of it. All of these issues, and more, are on our collective radar and we look forward to discussing them with you. Ask us anything!

Energy Tokenization simplifies, standardizes, and opens worldwide  currently existing energy investment ecosystem. Hence, energy producers  can trade directly with the green energy buyers (investors and  consumers) and raise their capital by selling energy upfront, at lowest  market prices. Energy tokenization protects liquidity and extends access  to capital.

TerraGreen enables tokenization, the tokenized energy  represents a contracting mechanism among an energy producer and energy  consumer.

Energy tokens will be used as funding, investing, and  paying bills. When a token is generated by the energy producers, they  invest energy in it and hence they are known as energy tokens. These  energy tokens are used by consumers to pay bills to the utilities. And  furthermore, they can be converted into fiat currencies too if needed.  The users will be rewarded too.

The bills paid by consumers to the  utility as an energy token won’t be a token anymore the platform will  directly help in funding the renewable energy projects which will  develop and help the future of the planet earth and will make earth a  better place.

Thus, energy  tokens act as a fuel for unlimited renewable development.

The  future of Renewable energy is bright with TerraGreen as we have built a  renewable energy platform with the help of blockchain technology.

When  energy project will tokenize their energy on TerraGreen, then it will be  counted as an Energy Token of a particular energy project. Hence, this  energy token will be backed by real energy. 

Now if any energy  project wants to collaborate with the utilities for use of generated  energy token then it will be stable coin and rate of this particular  won’t be changing. So, the consumer will be paying their energy  consumption with the help of this energy tokens. 

These tokes will  be of low cost than that of the normal fees that you have been charged,  which will be beneficiary for all of them to invest in TerraGreen.

Hence,  it has made easy for all who are related to the renewable sector to  connect to each other transparently as the tokens are counted as the  energy consumed and not the actual value they are known as energy backed  tokens and hence this whole ecosystem is hence called energy backed  economy.
