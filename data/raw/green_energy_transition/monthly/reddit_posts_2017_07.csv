"6pvpd0","collapse","skeptical","The Missing Energy Charts You Never See","Barry Saxifrage over at the National Observer did the collapse community a big solid by creating these charts to help us understand why fossil fuel emissions remain on an upwards trajectory. Here is the most important chart of fossil emissions based on millions of tons of oil equivalents.

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/bp-global-fossil-burn.jpg?w=1400

Emissions have risen 60% since humanity started tackling emissions in 1989. In the last several years, emissions have risen about 2.64% per year, increasing to 3% in the last two. This chart below shows how fast emissions are increasing with each passing decade.

The next chart shows the growth rate of increasing demand. In 25 of the last 26 years, we burned more fossil fuels than the year before, with only The Great Recession showing less demand than the previous.

Fossil fuels continue to absolutely dominate global energy consumption. Even a quarter century of global efforts to transition to safer energy sources was unable to make any meaningful dent in the dominance of fossil fuels. After 25 years, the fossil fuel share of total world energy demand has declined a mere 2%. That's like 1% per decade.

If you read green energy liberal media sites, you would be under the impression that we've turned the corner on fossil fuel use in the last 5 years, while nothing could be further from the truth.

But what about coal? Greenies wax enthusiastically optimistic when they talk about the death of coal, but can we trust the data on coal?

#Here are 5 reasons to be skeptical of a coal downturn:

**Reason #1: Our atmosphere shows no sign of it**

BP says that the reported decline in coal burning means that global CO2 emissions have stopped rising. Instead, CO2 levels in the air have been surging upwards at record-breaking rates.

**Reason #2: China's problem with under-reporting emissions**

China burns half the world's coal. And China also struggles to accurately measure and report its emissions.

**How inaccurate are China's numbers?**

The New York Times recently reported that China's ""pollution and energy data can be unreliable or outright fake.""

Widespread accounting problems have become a major issue threatening the roll out of China's new national carbon market. In other words, they don't trust their energy accounting enough to rely on it themselves.

An eye-watering example of one of China's past accounting errors happened just a few years ago. The government revised its 2013 coal estimates upwards by 600 million tonnes per year. That revision is double the entire reported global coal decline from the last three years, as seen in red on the chart below.

And before that 2013 revision, China had another gigantic one.

A decade earlier, another big error in China's coal reporting ""created an erroneous impression that China had succeeded in generating economic growth without increasing emissions."" Instead, their coal data was under-reported.

So, are China's more recent coal estimates also too low? Unfortunately it will be a few more years before we find out because China only reports revisions every five years.

China is certainly not the only nation with inaccurate coal numbers. India and others struggle with this too. Partly it is caused by developing nations' lack of resources. Partly it is caused by the growing pressure to under-report the numbers.

**Reason #3: Growing pressure to under-report and no way to catch it**

As the impacts of climate change and air pollution continue to grow worse, pressure is growing on foot-dragging governments and industries to fake their numbers so they appear better than they really are.

Caixin reports on another recent example from China: ""Recent Environmental Ministry inspections found that one-third of manufacturers in northern China had tampered with emissions data to avoid heavy penalties."" There is now a ""cottage industry"" to help fake the numbers. That cheating also took place in a regulated industry that required verification tests.

Scientific American warns that the ""world needs a way to verify that nations have made their promised carbon cuts … The current inability to verify that a nation has made its promised carbon cuts remains a long-standing loophole.

The New York Times reported on verification in China: ""Like some other nations, China, the world’s biggest polluter, has refused to accept international monitoring of its emissions.

**Reason #4: The global boom in new coal plants**

Investors pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into increasing global coal power capacity by 43% according to the coal-tracking database compiled by the German group, urgewald.

A recent article in The New York Times makes for sobering reading and leaves little doubt about the scale and breadth of the ongoing coal expansion. This global coal boom is being led by Chinese companies, but they aren't limiting their efforts to China. Nations with no history of coal burning are about to join the club for the first time.

A new joint report led by Oil Change International, ""Talk is Cheap: How G20 Governments Are Financing Climate Disaster,"" adds it all up. ""Of all public finance for energy provided by G20 institutions and the multilateral development banks between 2013 and 2015...58 percent supported fossil fuel production.""

The top four nations in public financing of fossil fuels between 2013 and 2015. Every one of them poured far more money into fossil fuels than into all other energy sources combined.

And just look at China. A whopping 90% of government energy spending went to fossil fuels. The ""Talk is Cheap"" report says China spent more on coal than on all non-fossil energy sources combined.

**Reason #5: The Clean Coal Boom**

Since burning coal is bad, people have learned to turn coal into chemicals, fertilizers and liquified or natural gas. There's nothing natural about it. So, burning coal doesn't count if you turn it into something else first? The magic is in getting carbon credits for doing so.
