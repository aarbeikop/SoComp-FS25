"br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","A Historical Perspective on Collapse","This is going to be a huge effort post, so bear with me. I’m an archaeologist by trade, and a huge chunk of archaeology as a discipline is devoted to studying how and why civilizations have collapsed. Countless ink has been spent on volumes about the topic. Given all this, I’ve had several arguments on here with people who I think have some serious misconceptions of what a collapse is. I’d like to use this opportunity to shed some light on how collapses have happened in the past, and what, if anything about them can be applied to the current one. This will likely not be a popular post here, given my previous discussions with people on the sub. Feel free to call me full of shit if you want, but at least hear me out. I'm not placing citations in the text, because I'm lazy, but I will list my sources at the end.

Before I get into the nitty-gritty, I’ll give you the punchline right out the gate: A lot of people on this sub have some *Day After Tomorrow* perspective of climate change or collapse, where it’s all going to happen at once. You’ll be cruising along, everything is normal, and then *wham*, civilization collapses and you’re in some post-apocalyptic hellscape where you’re fighting with your next-door neighbor over the last bag of Cheetos in existence. If we’re going off historical evidence for prior collapses, this is extremely unlikely. Given what we’re facing now, and how previous civilizations have dealt with similar circumstances, what is by far more likely is a slow burn spread out over the course of several generations. The world won’t end with a bang, but a whimper.

**We are not the first civilization to collapse**

Some people here seem to think that human history up until now has simply been a steady march of linear progress and that the collapse we’re facing will break that trend for the first time. In fact, human history is filled with collapses. Mesopotamia, Egypt, Bronze Age Agean, the Olmec, the Maya, Wari, Tiwanaku, the Romans, the Mississippians, the Anasazi, Angkor, Great Zimbabwe, etc. Collapse is a recurring cycle in human history. Every civilization that has ever existed has collapsed. Our current global civilization (which I would argue is now one global civilization since the days of the colonial empires) is the only one that hasn’t. It is foolish to think our civilization is some how different from these others. Different in scale, but not in process. Even if we weren’t facing the imminent problems that we’re all aware of, it would still be a question of *when* we collapse, not *if*.

**Collapse is Usually Slow and Uneven**

Most of our popular understanding of collapse is heavily informed by Hollywood apocalypse movies like *Dawn of the Dead* or *The Day After Tomorrow.* In these scenarios, everything is fine until one day there’s a cataclysmic event that throws the whole world into chaos. In reality this almost never happens, and on the few occasions it does, it’s usually a result of warfare or a catastrophic natural disaster like the eruption of a super volcano. For example, the Late Bronze Age collapse in the Mediterranean occurred in large part (but not entirely) due to invading groups known as the Sea Peoples that destroyed many of the cities and kingdoms in the region. Because this was an abrupt event, many of these cultures collapsed at the unbelievably fast pace of 50 years. That’s considered a *fast* collapse, and it’s still spread out over the course of a human lifetime.

But if we’re talking about the more “normal” causes of collapse (climate change, environmental degradation, political instability, economic disruption, etc.), it’s a process that can take centuries. Take for example one of the most commonly cited examples of collapse: the Classic Maya civilization of the southern lowlands of Guatemala/Belize/Mexico. The first such cities to collapse did so in the mid to late 8th century AD (Dos Pilas, one of the first, collapsed around AD 761). Other cities didn’t finish collapsing until around AD 900. This means, if you were born near the beginning of the Classic Maya collapse, your great grandchildren would be dead in the ground before the process ended. A neighboring civilization, Teotihuacan, appears to have suffered some kind of cataclysmic revolt or revolution around AD 550 which began its process of collapse, but it would take centuries before the city was abandoned completely. The Khmer Empire in Cambodia began to collapse in the 1300s but didn’t have the final nail driven in its coffin until the fall of the capital of Angkor to a war with Siam (Thailand) in 1431. The Roman Empire in the Mediterranean didn’t just collapse immediately when Rome was sacked by barbarians, but rather spent several centuries lingering on, delegating more and more of their provincial authority away to local rulers. The former Roman provinces started turning away from the capital and relying more on local leaders and resources.

All this is to say that it’s extremely unlikely you will witness the total collapse of civilization in your lifetime. Your children probably won’t either, unless we start World War III, which I suppose isn’t off the table. Instead, what you’ll see is things getting steadily worse, year by year, decade by decade. There will be local disasters, both natural and man-made, that will feel like civilization is collapsing for those who experience them. In most cases, people affected by these disasters will recover, but maybe not to the same level of economic development they had before. Over time, this will produce a trend of decline that will be most visible in hindsight. Future historians may write about how the collapse began in your time, but you’re not going to wake up one day to find the world broken.

**“Collapse” and “Population Bottleneck” are not the same thing.**

Not everybody on here is making this mistake, but quite a few people are talking about the looming collapse as if it’s going to wipe humanity off the earth, or at least severely reduce population to a tiny fraction of what it is now. I’m not saying that won’t happen, but if it does, it’s either going to be from us killing each other (in wars or genocides) or it will be an even slower process than collapse. Collapses happen on archaeological timescales (centuries), mass extinctions take place on geological timescales (hundreds of thousands to millions of years). The entire history of the human species from 200,000 years ago to present would be a single mass extinction event when viewed from the perspective of geologic time.

A population bottleneck due to collapsing ecosystems could take millennia to fully manifest. Localized collapses (the fall of a city, for example) will create localized population decline. But it’s important to remember these are local population declines that are driven more by people moving out of the area than mass death. Archaeologists typically call this phenomenon “voting with your feet.” If things get bad enough where people are living, they move. In the past, as with today, people were often resistant to having large migrations of refugees enter their territory. This can lead to conflict, which may result in mass death. But in these cases, the deaths are human caused, not the natural consequence of some Malthusian limit.

I want to be clear that I’m not saying humanity *won’t* go extinct. That may also be inevitable, but that’s best seen as a separate issue from the looming collapse that I see happening on the short to medium term.

**Collapse is a political process first**

Collapses happen for all sorts of reasons, and usually civilizations don’t collapse for just one reason. If people are facing one problem, they can usually adapt and deal with it. It’s when a whole bunch of things start going wrong at once that things start to break down. When things do eventually crack, it’s typically the political system that proves to be the weak link in the chain. People notice things are getting bad and they turn to their leaders for solutions. When people realize their leaders are either unable or unwilling to fix the problems, they lose confidence in their government which causes political instability. To illustrate this: I’m going to briefly describe a case study using the Classic Maya. I chose this example because many of the broad factors are similar to what we are currently experiencing, although they differ greatly in specifics.

The Maya heartland, located near the intersection of Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize, was the most densely populated area in the Western Hemisphere in the early 8th century AD. They were in trouble though. Climate was changing rapidly, causing periods of prolonged drought. Additionally, in many areas over farming was depleting soil nutrients causing decreasing crop yields. (This factor is often overstated; it was not uniform everywhere.) On top of all that, there was a lot of economic instability caused by disruption to trade networks due to the collapse of Teotihuacan’s empire in Central Mexico after AD 550. Given all this, the smart thing for the Maya to do at this time would be to scale back production. They could have adopted water conservation strategies, reduced the planting frequency to let fields recover between harvests, and focused on building a more sustainable economy.

They did not do this. Instead, the Classic Maya rulers, who literally positioned themselves as intermediaries between gods and humans, derived their legitimacy from their ability to organize gigantic religious festivals that required obscene amounts of resources. Each Maya king was engaged in a dick measuring contest with his rivals. Who can build the biggest pyramid? Who can organize the most elaborate festival? Who can secure the most military victories over their neighbors? The more successful you were, the more prestige you had. The nice thing about being a divine king who claims to speak to the gods is that when things are going well, you get all the credit. But when things start going poorly, people will blame you. If you claim to speak to the gods on our behalf, and we’re experiencing a huge drought, doesn’t that mean the gods are pissed at you? The Classic Maya rulers had only one solution to this crisis of faith: double down. As the ecosystem and the economy were eroding under their feet, the Classic Maya rulers continued to increase production to fund their festivals, construction projects, and wars.

The first cities to fall did so violently, like Dos Pilas (known to the Maya as *Mutal*), where a war between two rival dynasties, each backed by one of the major Maya political powers, saw the city torn apart. Literally: The defenders began disassembling the pyramids and palaces to build a double ring stone wall with a palisade and moat. It didn’t seem to matter, as archaeologists found the skeletons of the defenders strewn about the walls with spearpoints in them. These violent collapses were the exception rather than the rule, but as some cities began to fall, they created refugees that fled to cities that had not yet collapsed. Those refugees put extra pressure on already strained political systems and economic resources. Most of the cities would be abandoned slowly over the course of the next century or so, as things got so bad that people essentially gave up on the entire political project of divine kingship. Several Maya cities, like Uxmal and Chichen, survived the collapse and even thrived in the post-collapse world. But they did so by ditching the divine kingship political system of prior generations in favor of a system where the king shares power with councils of prominent noblemen. Ultimately, it was the political system that fell apart under the pressure, even though climate change and environmental degradation played a huge role in fueling it.

**Collapses are rarely “total”**

When civilizations collapse, its not like the people just disappear. As mentioned above, the Maya continued to build (smaller) cities after the collapse. In fact, the last one, Noj Peten, wouldn’t fall to the Spanish until 1697, after the Salem Witch Trials. The collapse of the Mississippian city of Cahokia (modern day St. Louis) would lead to a reemergence of the culture in the US Southeast, which would itself collapse centuries later due to a swine flu outbreak introduced by the conquistador Hernando de Soto. The collapse of Bronze Age Greece was a bad time, but Greek culture didn’t just go away. In time, they would form new cities and rebuild old ones.

Collapses typically involve the breakup of large political systems, long distance trade networks, and a depopulation of existing urban areas. The people don’t just disappear though, they usually form smaller, local political and economic systems. Quite often, in the event a large political entity breaks up, you’ll see an escalation of small-scale warfare and people will start shifting their settlements towards fortified defensible positions. You see this in Europe, following the breakup of the Roman Empire, and in Central Mexico after Teotihuacan fell.

People also don’t typically lose technologies when civilizations collapse. Extremely specialized technologies may be lost if the resources to produce them become unfeasible, but widely used technologies remain. That may sound like a good thing, but in our case I’m not sure it is. I can’t think of a worse-case scenario than global civilization collapsing, and people continue burning fossil fuels anyways.

**Seeing collapse as cyclical**

To finish up, I want to talk a bit about Resilience Theory as a framework for understanding collapse. It’s not a perfect theory, but it’s easy to understand and can go a long way towards explaining how and why collapses occur. Resilience Theory is a theory of ecosystems, developed by Holling and Gunderson, which has recently been adapted to explain the collapse of civilizations by archaeologists like Redman and Fisher. There’s a lot of math and data behind the theory, but in short, resilience theory describes the collapse of ecosystems (and civilizations) as occurring in regular cycles, which can be represented using [this diagram](https://i.ibb.co/bzSNg4s/Redman2005-fig1.png). Ecosystems have all sorts of variables that affect them, and sometimes these variables can destabilize existing arrangements. Under most circumstances, the ecosystem is flexible, adaptable, and resilient enough that it can bounce back from shocks due to destabilizing variables.

Over the course of an ecosystem’s development, it accumulates biomass and becomes increasingly more complex. This complexity creates rigidity, as the ecosystem becomes less tolerant to destabilizing variables. Eventually fluctuations in these variables exceed the ability of the ecosystem to accommodate them, triggering a massive release of the energy contained within the biomass of the ecosystem. Following this collapse, the ecosystem reorganizes into a new steady state, and begins accumulating biomass again. In ecosystem terms, imagine a forest. As the forest grows, it gets increasingly thick and crowded with plants. Eventually, it gets so crowded that a destabilizing variable (such as a wildfire or invasive species) will completely upend the ecosystem as it currently exists. This produces a period of destabilization, followed by a reorganization into a new ecosystem at a lower energy (less complex) state. This new ecosystem then begins building in complexity, and the cycle starts all over again.

In resilience theory terms, this cycle of growth, stagnation, collapse, and reorganization is occurring simultaneously at multiple interacting scales, as seen in [this diagram](https://i.ibb.co/WkBgS4w/Redman2005-fig2.png). Slower moving cycles can provide stability for fast moving cycles. On the other hand, fast moving cycles are themselves sources of instability for slow moving cycles.

All this is to say that “collapse” of ecosystems (and some would argue by transitive property civilizations) is an intermittent but regular process that emerges from the interaction of cycles of growth and reorganization occurring at multiple scales. Collapse is as much a part of nature as the changing of the seasons, or geologic cycles between glacial and interglacial periods. It sucks living through it, but it’s not the end of everything.

**Conclusions**

In summary: human civilization is going to collapse, probably soon. It may actually be happening right now. Barring WWIII or an asteroid hitting the earth, it will not be quick. It will be slow, it will be uneven, and it will likely take a century or more before we hit the bottom. The collapse will not be the end. Humans are not going to go extinct in the near future. Humans *may* go extinct, and as I already mentioned, the 200,000-year existence of anatomically modern humans is a single mass extinction event when viewed from geologic time. But that is a much larger, slower process than the collapse we’re looking at for the short to mid-term future, which from my perspective, will probably be qualitatively similar to other collapses we’ve experienced throughout history.
