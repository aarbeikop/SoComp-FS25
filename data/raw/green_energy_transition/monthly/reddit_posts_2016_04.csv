Since I introduced myself in the ACS AMA last year (http://redd.it/3fqnqo) , I’ll only say that I’m the Director of the [American Chemical Society’s Green Chemistry Institute](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry.html) where we work to catalyze and enable the implementation of green chemistry and engineering throughout the global chemistry enterprise.  At the moment we’re getting ready for the 20th Annual Green Chemistry & Engineering Conference, held in Portland, OR June 14-16 (http://www.gcande.org/) and I hope you can join us for what is shaping up to be a great Conference..
So, feel free to ask me anything about the current and future states of sustainable and green chemistry and engineering.  Like last year, feel free to ask me anything about how sustainable and green chemistry is implemented in industry, or how you can apply it in your research, or what challenges you’re encountering in your work as you work to implement it.
