Looking for advice...","TLDR: reading new UN report has me seriously considering quitting my comfortable corporate job in NYC and moving home to California to pursue working to mitigate climate change full-time in business context.  Am I crazy?  Looking for advice!
---

I (26M) grew up in California and have been on the East Coast (DC and now NYC) for about 10 years.  I've been plodding along in my career in B2B tech and currently have a well paying corporate job in NYC.  I majored in a liberal arts-y meets international relations degree with a focus on environment/energy type stuff but ultimately ended up pursuing a more startup/tech scene career.

I've always been very aware of climate change, etc. and the challenges it poses as well as thinking sometimes about how I'd like to refocus my career on this at some point when it makes sense.  However, after reading parts of the UN Climate Report and related coverage (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html), I'm seriously considering quitting my job and moving back to the SF Bay Area in California (to be closer to family and also b/c it seems there is a lot happening there in terms of what I'm interested in) to pursue a career doing SOMETHING to help steer the Earth towards a less sucky future.  I know the cost of living there is quite high.

I'm convinced that we cannot wait for fickle politicians to address this - it must be business solutions to climate change while the general gradually public shifts its tastes/focus by taking these threats seriously (ex: renewable energy becoming more competitive w fossil fuels, meatless 'meat' alternatives, some new refrigerant technology, etc.).  Of course voting in politicians who give a crap about climate change is also important and I intend to do this as well and do whatever I can in terms of public/private partnership type stuff.

I've read the Drawdown book that is frequently cited in this sub.  I have a good amount of money saved up to do a job search for at least a year if necessary but will likely be living with family initially so costs will be low.

Is this crazy?  I feel an urgency to DO SOMETHING that I haven't felt before and feel that I can no longer in good conscience continue in my current career/job (data consulting stuff for fortune 500 companies).

Any guidance is appreciated: ideas about jobs, organizations in SF Bay Area or in wider world, ways to get involved that pay decently, career arcs, feeling like you are truly an agent in this wider effort, etc.  What I want to find is an organization that really does something - not just lip service, not just talk.  Results.  Products.  World-changing feats.  Not BS corporate ""we are going green"" marketing that is meaningless.  I'm aiming high.  I don't want to just feel like I'm ""making a difference"".  I want to know that I truly am, even if it's on a small scale as an individual can only do so much.  Tesla is an obvious, probably cliché example of this (though some would argue there is a lot of talk there!).

I recognize that this is something an optimist would do.  I believe one has to be optimistic in this situation though there is plenty of reason to be pessimistic too given humanity's track record on this issue so far.

"9nt58c","collapse","skeptical","Collapse Is All In Your Head","Runaway Hothouse Earth starts between 1.5 C and 2.0 C.

We will hit 1.5 by 2030 and 2.0 by 2040 depending on your baseline.

We are running out of soil so fast that in 50 years there will be no human agriculture. 73% of our antibiotics comes from soil.

Climate scientists use different baselines for their projections to confuse the public and delay serious action.

Green energy scientists use exclusionary metrics to exaggerate renewable energy benefits and ignore disaster. They say burning trees doesn't count because they'll grow back in 50 years. They say we can have 100% electricity by 2050, when they know goddamned well that's a lie because electricity is only 20% of the world's total energy. Humans never had a 100% renewable energy transition and they take at least 3 generations to effect.

We spend $1 trillion / year killing women and children in the middle east over who's going to sell Europe its natural gas and oil.

We sent all our manufacturing jobs to China, and now middle america doesn't want to vote for the woman who sent them there.

73% of Americans are too overweight, too stupid and too criminal to join the army.

We have been trying to reduce C02 since 1992, and emissions are 60% higher. When will you admit failure? When we're dead?

I have been writing about collapse for a few years, and I've neglected some important work on my house, now I got to spend more to fix it because I was in denial.

There are more drivers of collapse than cards in a deck, and we're not playing with a full deck.

The top 5 meat companies cause more emissions than the largest oil company. Do you see McDonalds going out of business anytime soon?

We like to say, Oh it's the billionaires fault, or it's capitalism's fault.

If you're thoughtful and educated enough to read this sentence, it's your fault because you'll likely be in the top 20% of income earners.

"9nkrko","collapse","skeptical","""get the economics right and people will jump on green energy""","Got talking about climate change last night with a white, affluent, Boomer-age business guy.  That was his opinion - with the right economic incentives, people will make the switch away from fossil fuels.  And then it'll all be sorted.  He mentioned some initiative to install solar panels on NYC public housing projects like it was something, and not just less than a drop in the ocean.

This was in response to my comment that we're not going to do what's necessary, there isn't going to be a coordinated global effort, we'll just carry on as usual and then slam right into whatever is coming.

I guess it's easier to be dismissive when you're not likely to be around for worst of it.

I feel like the conversation sort of epitomized our problem:  There are still lots of people who believe it will just take a bit of tinkering, and won't be affected if they're wrong.  *They* will squeak through without having to make major sacrifices.

The rest of us - who have 30, 50, 80 years left - are the ones who have to face the real consequences.  I feel like our voices should count for more.

"9reyic","sustainability","action-oriented","Jevon’s paradox: Ignored piece of the green puzzle","Jevons paradox states that efficiency improvements paradoxically increases energy consumption. This was observed back in 1865 by Stanley Jevons when coal consumption soared due to rise of efficient steam engines. 

I have the following concerns:

1.  This is happening again  in our modern era especially with lithium batteries and other consumer technologies. This arises from  the higher disposable income of the consumers due to efficiency gains. Also the disposable income can be spent somewhere else and may result in more net emissions from that household than before. For example, better house insulation tech will save an person of X dollars as compared to his previous year and that person spends that money taking an extra flight trip and thereby neutralising net emission reduction.

2.  Most of the green tech companies are marketing efficiency improvements in their quest to mitigate climate change without really accounting for this paradox and people are kind of misled on the overall emission reduction.

I think it’s important to track all consumeristic activities from a certain income level household ( will be laborious and privacy concerns too) before making the judgement on the emission reduction from a particular green technology. Then we are not ignoring the elephant in the room. Would like to hear your thoughts and other strategies.
