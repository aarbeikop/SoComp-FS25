"3txy84","collapse","skeptical","The Green Energy Trap","Vaclav Smil explains the energy efficiency trap, the intense dependency of renewable energy on fossil power production and how much complexity our hi-tech green energy fantasies will face, as well as how incredibly difficult, long and complex energy transitions actually are for humanity. Because of these factors, he says the energy transition to renewables will takes generations, not just decades.

In ""After The Age Of Cheap Oil"" two Finnish energy experts tell us that in a world of scarce oil, every ounce of it we possess will have to meet essential needs, i.e. food-shelter etc., before those of alternative energy. 

http://fpif.org/like-everything-else-alternative-energy-requires-cheap-oil/

To close down a 1 megawatt fossil fuel plant we require 10 megawatts of solar and wind power just because they don't run all the time. This does not include the massive battery and smart-grid infrastructure solar and wind require. We refuse to even harden existing grids against solar flares, let alone smarten non-existent grids that will take decades and trillions to build. 

Vaclav Smil is Canadian. So is Naomi Klein. Naomi Klein spent her whole life relying on nuclear power. Vaclav Smil says comparing wind power in a small windy country like Denmark -- with its international smart-grid right next to German markets -- to vast countries like Canada and the U.S. -- who have no smart-grids -- is ridiculously misleading. This is what Naomi Klein does, I call it lying. 

Klein extols the green energy virtues of Germany, where 50% of their renewable energy comes from burning trees imported from all over the world. Then they use this renewable energy to build cars for world export. Cars run on roads made from oil. German diesel cars burn palm oil and soy oil imported from Brazil and Indonesia, then they lie about their emissions. There is nothing green about Germany. This is lying dressed up as fantasy.

Green energy is low-density energy in that it is spread out over large geographical areas, i.e. - there is not enough land in South Korea for a 100% energy transition to solar and wind power. There are a dozen mega-cities facing certain near-term severe storm-drought-flood damage and are impractical for wind and solar power. Too many foggy windless days in China and the Typhoon or Monsoon season in places like Japan and India, never mind building a solar farm in Miami. It's laughably stupid.

What this means is that the resource intensity per unit of intermittent energy production is unsustainably high in the face of rapid climate change stressors. Not to mention that solar and wind products have a planned life-cycle obsolescence of 30 years. Recycling their component alloys cost more than mining for them in the first place because recycling them uses more energy. Each time component minerals are recycled they lose their qualitative usefulness in our high-standard hi-tech world. 

We are set to double energy demand in 50 years exactly when all resource production becomes more difficult to afford because of low-ore grades and high energy costs combined with water and food shortages in the face of ever increasing climate stressors, i.e. - new fossil fuel sources demand more water than ever before exactly when we are facing water shortages due to climate stressors.

The energy trap is leading us into a complexity trap where the confluence of crises overwhelms human society. Or, put another way, most of us never knew shortages of energy, food and water, or even shortages of anything. The last time we had just an energy shortage was in 1973 and that's how we ended up with Ronald Reagan's contra freedom fighters and Soldier of Fortune magazine. Don't be fooled by temporary gluts from capital misallocation. 

Without severe demand destruction, there is no energy future. But, nobody wants to destroy energy demand 80% in 50 years when at the same time all forecasts point to a 100% increase in energy demand in those same 50 years. It's like stealing candy from a capitalist baby. Nobody wants to hear it except for people who don't understand what that really means. Especially those who oppose austerity.  We are incapable of resolving energy  -political, -economic and -ecological dynamics. But relax, it'll be years before peak human slavery, peak civilization and peak cannibalism.

100 years ago cars were the latest greatest thing, and millions of blacks in Africa were killed to control the rubber plantations for all the tires cars needed.

100 years later swiping video screens is the latest greatest thing. and millions of blacks were killed in Africa for the conflict minerals all our smartphones need.

20 years from now eating will be the latest greatest thing and millions of blacks will be killed in Africa as China and the U.S. battle for control of the black slave farms rich people need to eat. The farm land we are fighting to save in Africa is not for the Africans, it's for the rich foreign government and corporate landowners in China and the U.S..

There will be no green hobbit shire with dancing rainbow ponies and unicorns.

Next year, we'll do it all again. Same story, different metaphors.

Green is the new brown. Devolutionary Transition indeed.

Dakar and Sao Paulo will be some of the first dozen major mega-cities to fall due to severe climate disruption. Solar-wind power in places like Miami and coastal Asia make no sense. Many major mega-cities are vulnerable to drought-flood-storm extremes. Pacific heating will accelerate the earth's heat equilibrium state jump, as well as accelerate runaway arctic methane emissions and runaway mass extinction data points. Nobody knows if we already passed the Final Runaway data point and we won't know until it is too late. We will spend lifetimes arguing about it. The only question is, is it too late? The only answer is, yes, but we want proof first.
