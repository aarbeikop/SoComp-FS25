"3nl617","collapse","skeptical","The Green Energy Bubble Collapse Prick","Phosphate and potassium are 2 absolutely essential, irreplaceable fertilizers that cannot be manufactured or substituted for in nature by peoplekind. We will very soon run out of them. We can recycle them, but we don’t because we serve exploitive extraction corporate services and their government paid public exploitive extraction protection services.

Debt is the promise of future energy at some one dollar per 10 milliwatts.
We have promised more energy than we will deliver. But, every exploitive extraction operation will return less resource per unit of energy. It will take more and more energy to extract more and more resources. Energy costs for basically free planetary services will go up. Air, food and water will cost more.

People are energy illiterate, even Engineers forget energy basics. They don’t understand rising energy demand while we transition to a lower power density obtained from intermittent energy products that will only cost more future energy at the end of their life-cycles in times of severe shortages. Solar and wind are the planned obsolescence of massive consumer energy products that will have to be replaced in one generation. This is mathematically so incredibly mad as to defy sanity. This is when some smart ass will quote, “Should our grasp exceed our reach?” or some crazier bullshit like that.

Once investors understand bond haircuts are for real, derivatives and Insurance constructs will collapse like cards in the face of mathematical energy extinction.

Hopefully this will happen before food and water shortages begin in earnest up the exponential curve of extractive negative energy returns on investment. In other words, I hope financial collapse happens before resource collapse. But, what I’m really getting at is that I’m trying to warn you that you don’t have time to wait for global warming and mass extinction in 20 years. You have to reduce harm to your family now. Start incremental preparations.

My Naomi Klein rant was buried by TruthDig and tossed out by TruthOut. Reddit deleted my post with no explanation until someone tried to post a lengthy reply.

Since I’m a vain, shallow, egomaniac — I really care about stuff like this.

No one ever accused me of being too friendly on account of my full spectral introspective autistic assburgers and prickly social turrets.

In other words, I’m not the sharpest or quickest tool in the shed.

I’m 57 years old and noticed the sun came up from the east today.

I also just only noticed that, over the last few years, my anti-Naomi Klein comments resulted in sure-fire editorial omission bans from assorted debate threads.

Their funders want to suck the zombies' life-blood matrix. In collapse of empire, only corporate tax grabs remain on the well picked public carcass.

I only cut grass in a trailer park for a living but know a bloody big shit storm when I see it. The green labelled “bio-degradable” cloth tissues always clog the shit pumps. I’m gonna call my next dog Rotor or Rooter.","2015-10-05 15:58:48","31","19","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/3nl617/the_green_energy_bubble_collapse_prick/","True","BeezleyBillyBub","1747923188.554562","green energy transition","manual"
"3ngzou","collapse","skeptical","My Review of *This Changes Everything*","I intended this as a comment to the “This Changes Nothing” post, but that vanished before I could submit. I agreed with that obvious title and having recently read *This Changes Everything*, will offer a review that may be found more suitable for discussion.

Klein does not view the leading ‘climate deniers’ as deluded; she sees them as having made a cynical choice to protect the fossil fuel industry at all costs, confident that the full disaster will not unfold in their lifetimes. She excoriates the mainstream environmental groups for being cronies and lackeys of industry – an accusation that some make against her. I found her chapters on the ‘false prophets’ of billionaire philanthropy and the non-solution of geo-engineering of particular interest. Those astute points, along with Klein’s effective writing style, are among the book’s merits.

Klein is honest in her motivations: she is of a democratic socialist orientation, has been late in fully understanding the looming climate disaster, but now sees in it the opportunity of killing two birds with one stone. Conservatives have long accused the environmental movement of precisely this – ‘watermelons are green on the outside but red within’ – and this returns to her first point, that climate deniers, unlike the general population, fully understand what is at stake. However, for me, the ideological equation should be the reverse. To paraphrase Lincoln, if we can preserve the Biosphere without abolishing capitalism, we should do that, but if market mechanisms are running to its destruction, then we must take an alternative path.

Klein proposes that we must turn the fossil fuel companies into public utilities, reasoning that we must leave most of their fossil energy assets in the ground, while applying the profits accrued from burning our remaining carbon rations to the transition into renewable energy. She asserts that this 100% carbon-free future is achievable on a short time scale, a faith that seems inspired by a single academic study. Concurrent with this transition, the Left can achieve every item on its agenda, and complete social, gender and ethnic equality will reign over the Planet Kumbaya forever and ever – this is but a mild exaggeration her goals.

How is this to be done? Apparently, the new model is the Abolitionist movement. With media events and protests, reminiscent of Occupy Wall Street, they will block specific corporate projects and rally a great democratic movement to the cause. She does offer some practical examples, most prominently, the legal actions that First Nations are taking to halt the construction of infrastructure for the export of oil from tar sands, but that strategy may not be applicable beyond Canada. I view Klein as the Harriet Beecher Stowe of this neo-abolitionist movement, with her book and movie as its *Uncle Tom’s Cabin*.

> “And let’s take for granted that we want to do these radical things democratically and without a bloodbath, so violent, vanguardist revolutions don’t have much to offer in the way of road maps.” Page 452.

Before returning the book, I transcribed that quote because I found it to be naïve. As a member of the Soft Left, Klein takes care to separate her anti-capitalism from that of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist past. On meeting Mrs. Stowe, in the midst of The War Between the States, Lincoln is to have said, “So you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.” Maybe so, but that struggle was concluded by a nation in arms, by the brutal wills of Lincoln, Grant, Sherman and Sheridan. I have no confidence in Klein’s road map. There will be blood.

"3nbxx5","collapse","skeptical","Barking up the wrong tree","People blame climate change for a lot of problems that it's probably not responsible for. The thing to understand here is that ecosystems are self-regulating phenomena, that aim to create the type of conditions that stabilize their environment and generate hospitable conditions for more organisms to thrive. 

Failure to understand this and accept our dependence on them is causing the crisis. This is a product of neo-enlightenment thinking, where man believes that he himself will be the source of his salvation. The conservative solution is to put faith in a force higher than ourselves that gave birth to us, which is nature.

Take the drought in California for example. People will tell you that America has more trees today than it had a century ago, but that's irrelevant. [Compared to the 1930's, the number of large trees in California has declined by up to 50%.](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/5/1458.abstract) Specifically, California has lost most of its giant redwood forests, which take centuries to grow.

Trees cause local as well as regional rainfall, through a variety of different mechanisms. Through evapotranspiration trees deliver most of the rain we find inland. Redwood trees due to their great height cause a lot of rain because the water sticks to their needles.

In California Coast Ranges, a single Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) can ""douse the ground beneath it with the equivalent of a drenching rainstorm and the drops off redwoods can provide as much as half the moisture coming into a forest over a year"". 

California is also likely affected by deforestation in Brazil, which changes global precipitation patterns. In Sweden, old growth forest is now removed, to create ""green energy"", which means we're burning wood to keep our lights on. 

The fact of the matter is that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should make large sections of the planet that are now barren hospitable to trees. In Africa, the rate of greening can be very high, [models suggest up to 10% of the Sahara can become reforested per decade.](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/staff/claussenmartin/publications/claussen_al_africa-hotspot_igbp_02.pdf)

Climate change can cause problems, but most of the problems we see now probably aren't caused by climate change, they're caused by human stupidity, technophilia and biophobia. There is nothing on this planet more valuable than an old growth forest.

All economically viable fossil fuels will be burned, we shouldn't expect that we're going to stop that. Instead, the focus should lie on adaptation and cultural transition. Most of the world could be reforested if we changed our diet and stopped eating meat and started eating plants, oysters and mussels instead. 

We also have to accept that the days where <2% of the population works in food production are over, but this requires changing our culture, which now sees a ""knowledge economy"" full of college educated office workers as the ideal to strive for.

Change your cultural priorities and you will find that the global change in climate will be a manageable transition. Don't put your faith in global meetings of guys in suits and their bright green techno-solutions. Millions of years of evolution taught you how to intuitively recognize a healthy environment. It consists of big fat trees and shrubs and vines growing underneath them, not hideous endless lines of biofuel corn or wind turbines.

"3o3t02","collapse","skeptical","Green Energy Is 100% Bull Shit","In 2007, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2015 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

In 2014, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2030 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

The IPCC says we can make this change because of what they call ""negative-emissions bio-energy"". meaning we will get energy by consuming plant matter in a way that pulls more CO2 out of the air than it emits; for which, by the way, no such technology exists, and the kicker is, they say, that we will need 1.5 billion acres of NEW farmland to do it. That much farmland is about the size of India, which is equal to nearly 50% of all the arable land on earth. 

The acronym for this fantasy is BECCS (Bio-Energy Carbon Capture & Storage). The real acronym is BS (Bull Shit). Where do you think we'll find all this new farmland? The rainforests. World hunger will guarantee it.

Because we add 1 MILLION PEOPLE TO EARTH EVERY 5 DAYS (each who would very much like to eat every day for at least 50 years), we will have to grow more food over the these next 50 years than we grew in all of the last 10,000 years, combined. This is called math, get used to it, it will rule your life. We already converted nearly half the earth's surface into cities and farmland. Do you seriously believe 9 billion people will stop eating meat and wasting food? Yet, Scientific American says humans only have 60 years of agriculture left if we continue to lose and degrade soil at current rates. And climate change only guarantees faster soil degradation rates.

To feed nine billion people all at once for all their lives means we will need 12 million acres of brand new farmland EVERY year for 30 years. Instead, we are losing 24 million acres of farmland EVERY year. We are losing soil at twice the rate we need to grow it just to be able to eat, never mind the additional requirements of BECCS.

In 10 years 4 billion people will be without enough water.

In 10 years 2 billion people will be severely short of water.

Over the next 50 years energy demand will double (at the same time we have to reduce emissions at least 50%) because over 2 billion rural refugees will move to cities, and 75% of the infrastructure they require does not even exist yet. Already, China has poured more concrete in the last few years than the U.S.A. has in all of the last 100 years. Concrete production is a super-emitter of carbon into the air. 

Yet, it also takes 10 times the amount of rated intermittent energy to close one fossil fuel plant simply because renewable energy is intermittent and fossil energy is not. It will be a physical impossibility to meet all future demand with 100% renewable energy and reduce emissions all at the same time. 50% of the renewable power in Europe comes from burning imported wood from all over the world. Rainforests are slashed and burned in South America and Indonesia to grow soy and palm oils that are exported Europe to burn in German diesel cars, who then lie about their emissions.

We cannot meet a doubling of energy demand using the lower power density and intermittency solar and wind technologies provide. These products only last some 30 years and use more minerals per unit of power. Recycling their alloys will use more energy and cost more than mining for them in the first place costs.
We constantly lie to ourselves about how bad it is. We lie to ourselves about how smart we are. We lie to ourselves about how stupid we are.

You can tell these reality based facts to Naomi Klein and Joe Romm until you are blue in the face. Nothing will change their mind because they lie. It's that fucking simple.

"3pzgdt","renewable","action-oriented","Careers interested in renewable energy, and environmental-friendly cars(ev,phev,hv) whose studying business management in Korea.","Hi guys, I'm a 20- year old Korean Freshman in university whose interested in environmental problems caused by global warming and renewable energy. The momentum of my interest was watching ""The Unconvenient Truth"" made by Al Gore, and reading books about Elon Musk.

I now study at Kyungpook National University at Daegu, South Korea majoring in Business management.
I really want to work at Tesla, Solarcity in reference to my interest. Or some other companies that are related to the renewable energy and green-cars.

But for me right now, I've got no idea what I have to choice, do, and make efforts on. To be honest, I have no idea what I should do to enter the companies in the related areas. Plus I want to work especially in planning fields.
Whether I should study some fields related to the energy, engineerings? Can just learning about business management and getting a license related to financing and accounting help me find a job in the related fields?

Till now I just polished up English skills(with toeic 900s) , and tried to read books related to the fields of these renewable energy and the seriousness of environmental problems. Plus I tried to watch every video of Elon Musk.
I don't have much expertise in science and mathematics. Should I move my major to related fields? (Cf. in Korean high school educational systems, we have to make a choice whether to study liberal arts or natural science in grade 1 high school. I chose liberal arts and have no basic expertise in science and mathematics.

I just thought of my life in several ways. First choice would be studying Korean SAT in natural science version as to get expertise in science and mathematics, and go to a major which will be related to renewable energy or green-car(There are majors in Korean
universities that are called Green- Car major , renewable energy major)

Secondly, whether I should now try to study abroad in America. As there are much more universities and companies that are really related to these fields.
Third, I can do a double case study. My university has a major called energy engineering major.

Lastly, looking further and going to a graduate school. This year one of my seniors in the same major, university went to University of Pennsylvania where Elon Musk graduated
These are the four choices which I thought.

Also I want to ask although I just had the degree of business management, is it possible to work in companies related to REs and car companies.

Can you give me some advice? I have the passion to work in these areas but want to make the object clear right now to go for. Thank you.","2015-10-24 02:09:20","2","1","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/Renewable/comments/3pzgdt/careers_interested_in_renewable_energy_and/","True","green_ht","1747924157.844296","green energy transition","manual"
