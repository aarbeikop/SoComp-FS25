"5in9jk","collapse","skeptical","It's worse than an elephant. The invisible badger in the living room - green energy and social organization.","Elephants are visible. The whole point of the phrase, ""an elephant in the living room"" is meant to convey that there is a huge problem that people _see_ but don't really want to talk about. 


The issue I wish to raise today is an issue that isn't _seen_ as much. This came up in a recent post where someone brought up, I'll just say, ""green energy"" and how much of it we might need to transition off dinosaur juice in the next while. OK, that's fine to talk about. We seem to talk about that a lot in here, and elsewhere. I wouldn't call that the 'elephant'. 


Scale is a big issue, and that goes both ways. In that thread, /u/Goocy pointed out that batteries have a major energy cost, and also that residential electricity usage represents a small fraction of the overall _energy_ usage, especially when compared to commercial and industrial uses of electricity, and then consider the masses of solid, liquid, and gaseous dinosaur juice products (e.g. coal, diesel, and 'natural gas') used for heating, manufacturing, agriculture, resource extraction, industrial and commercial transportation, and so forth. 


I agreed with /u/Goocy's sentiment. I also wanted to move past that elephant. All good points made thus far in the lineup, but perhaps the larger issue - the badger (arbitrary animal selection - I've seen badgers and they're ferocious and I'm more scared of a badger than an elephant) in the living room that we don't even see, let alone talk about much, is still a menace and arguably a more difficult thing to corner. The issue is bigger than just the scale of rolling out solar PV and batteries, enough to replace the edifice we've built on dinosaur juice... though that is a huge issue, and many would argue that solar, wind, and batteries won't 'get us there' due to scale, materiel requirements, and so forth. 


It seems that the issue at hand is whether or not we're _doing it_. Essentially, at the risk of being melodramatic, if we don't stop pretending things are fine (i.e. ignoring the first elephant) and switching gears and doing everything we can to get net-zero carbon energy going regardless of the dollar cost, we're doomed. Maybe in ten years, or maybe a hundred. Because we don't really know how fast it'll be at your door, and much is at stake, we should be focused on getting off our dinosaur juice addiction and moving to net-zero carbon, now. _Are we, though_? 


The invisible problem here is that everyone needs access to this stuff, because otherwise, they'll continue burning tires, rainforests, dung, diesel _en masse_, and everything else they can get their hands on. And, I can hardly blame them, one human to another. I personally benefit from the equivalent of hundreds of human slaves' worth of carbon energy on a daily basis just by eating food and wearing clothes and going to work ""as per normal"", and they want prosperity as much as I've gotten used to it. Sustainability cannot simply be a lifestyle choice for the global 1%. 


So the point. Everyone needs zero-net-carbon energy, and they need it regardless of the cost, because even at a ""cheap"" two dollars a watt, installed, for solar _without_ batteries, that's still well more expensive than cutting down some old growth, or collecting camel dung, and burning it. It's also not feasible as far as accountants are concerned when you're running a steel recycling facility and you need steady, cheap, 24/7 power. There's much that could be said further down this rabbit hole, but the point I'll refocus on is ""who benefits, and who pays"". 


Despite the arbitrary nature of the structure of ""the economy"" that we've built, this is the first thing so-called decision makers say when you talk 'green anything'; who pays? And this is happening in 'wealthy' countries, not just places where camel dung seems like a good fuel source. So, then, how do we move forward? I still get stuck here. I'm stuck on that point because virtually every policy meeting I've ever heard of, been to, or ran, gets stuck on the ""sure, but who pays for that"". We have a system that largely has decision makers wanting to keep their elected or appointed positions, both in public and private sector, based on a very short term, almost entirely financial performance rubric. 


Around this point in my thinking, /u/Goocy hit a home run:


>The interesting question is: in which possible forms of society is it likely that a wide-spread low-carbon energy expansion will happen? In my view, this is a continuous spectrum between eco-uptopia and dictatorship.


Yes, what would this have to look like? This was a delightful response to the overall question mark I still had not found the words to itch. The badger became apparent. It's a relatively innocuous problem, or perhaps too arcane, or too generally inaccessible. Why won't decision makers just do ""the right thing""? Why aren't solar panels covering every roof in the world? Well, aside from being slightly hyperbolic and feigning naïveté (and assuming we could even _build_ the required amount of 'green infrastructure' to 'get there' ignoring money all together) to _some_ extent, and perhaps the current (but not only) limiting factor, is the way in which we structure our society. To respond to /u/goocy, I stepped back further, because I still don't have an answer at the moment about _what society would to look like in order to spread the low-carbon energy technology out_, but it is a fabulous question and worth focusing on. 

Instead, I question what level of population, not to mention general specialization (i.e. division of labour leading to expertise in specific areas, like medicine, engineering, and so forth) is possible in a society down the road when we've well-past the process of sloping down the peak-everything curve, more of our topsoil is gone, and the state of the world is generally rough everywhere, and not just ""over there""? What is going to happen to us if we don't sort ourselves out socially? Or worse, what happens even if we do sort ourselves out and it isn't enough? 


I have little faith that we will do much before things get significantly worse to sidestep the issues we're facing, especially given the slow (or no) progress we've made towards getting away from dinosaur juice. 90 million barrels a day don't lie. Humanity may well end up in some eco-utopia in the centuries to come, but I think we're in for a very difficult transition period that our global society may not escape from, from which a 'better' society might emerge.


Collapse is not inherently bad from a safe vantage point of a very long-term perspective. When slow, incremental change isn't getting us there, sometimes it is helpful to tear something down to bare metal in order to then rebuild from basic principles without the time-worn bureaucracies that spring up wherever we try to engage in complex organization. But that's _painful_. The social structures holding us in place also help to coordinate the transportation of billions of meals' worth of food around the planet on a daily basis. 


However, ""managing this"" may be largely out of our hands already. Once we're aware that we've lost control of the car, it's likely already too late to get it back onto the icy road. As numerous have said, we should have been doing this stuff twenty (fifty? A hundred?) years ago with a dedicated, consistent drive. But, we didn't. We did not organize to accomplish that end goal. We talked about it, but it's action that matters now. And, effective action is only possible with coordination. 


Largely _uncoordinated_ activity can have major overall systemic effect, like the total amount of carbon we're putting into the atmosphere. Entropy is _easy_. It's _orders of magnitude harder_ to coordinate human activity to accomplish an end-goal we can still barely define or agree to in the mainstream psyche. It also tugs on a wide array of almost mythical and largely unquestioned practices, such as the having-of-currency, and the concept of private property, to name two. Not to say that these two example factors are ""part of the problem"", but they do influence, guide, constrain, and frame human activity towards certain outcomes. Capitalism isn't to ""blame"" for the current situation, but it still contributed. Can it be fixed? No idea. Will it? Not sure. My crystal ball doesn't work.


In a larger context, can we do anything to 'turn the ship around'? No idea. We're fighting a host of social behaviours and psychological paradigms that are very difficult to change, even for 10% of the population, and meanwhile, timers are ticking that we don't fully know about, and they influence each other in a non-linear fashion. The paradigms at the bottom of it all are ones that people feel attached to, along the lines of 'motherhood' and 'apple pie', as the saying goes. I'm not sure if we've built a society that can _change **enough**, fast enough_ to enable, encourage, or force our behaviour to change, or if we will simply experience the **pure wall of physics** that is coming our way, that will force us into a corner not of our choosing. 

Of course, it's not that nobody knows about this stuff, but again, scale is an issue. I'm sorry, but 5% of the population switching to LED light bulbs is not going to get us there. Deciding when you've ""done enough"" is also part of the social problem we usually don't see, because there are people who believe that those LED bulbs, Priuses, and going vegan sometimes when I feel like it, are going to get us there. Sorry, that's not enough either. Not even close. It doesn't barely even register. Even if everyone did it, and we're _definitely not_ doing that all. 


So what's the wall of physics coming? Maybe there's a glimmer in my crystal ball after all. 


As our society experiences lower-return-on-energy-investment energy (and consequently more expensive or at least more volatile with respect to price and availability), poorer and more uncertain crop yields, mega-storms, droughts, and/or more social unrest that turns from isolated, temporary incidents to larger zones of relatively permanent unrest, it also gets harder to make substantial societal changes or even keep things running under the status quo. The bureaucracies and complex organizations that were not always that efficient but still kind of got bread into the supermarket are also very hard to build up in a hurry. Supply chains don't form overnight, nor does trillions of dollars of infrastructure. Not for billions of peoples' worth of needs. 


I also don't think it would be enough simply to 'reduce the number of mouths' on the planet at this point, because we're only feeling the effects of the carbon we put into the system forty years ago. Not to mention that there is no feasible way to organize a reduction in the number of people on the planet in a hurry, at least, not a politically viable one that anyone would agree to. I'm certainly not advocating that. We also largely require technical specialists to run the extended techno-bubble of 7+ billion people reliant on dinosaur juice powered agriculture and manufacturing, and when that stops, we basically need hordes of people, all fed and able to sit in a room all day and learn to be engineers and physicists, to out-techno-bubble the previous popping bubble of peak-everything and life-support system failure. Without 'industrial society', with all its complexity, we can't build a planet's worth of ""green"" technology and infrastructure. You don't get a churning out of a billion solar panels with a social situation that resembles The Walking Dead. But, back to population control... 


Most people say that a fully developed world would see a fully stable population, but we can't really do that because ""developed, post-industrialized nations"" rely on ""industrializing or developing nations"" for most of their manufactured goods, much of their food, and general resources, not to mention labour, and those countries rely on ""undeveloped nations"" for raw materials. If everyone was living a middle-class Western lifestyle, there'd be nobody to make $10 t-shirts. There would be nobody to pick the cotton, and nobody to make it in to thread and fabric, and nobody to dye it, and nobody to sew it, and so forth. Our whole system is based on systematic exploitation and a teleological expectation that we will all get to sit back and relax one day, and live a life of _both_ luxury, and leisure. We can't all do that. Not with our social system. We also have a debt-based financial system that requires growth or it implodes; at that point we would have the resources but the social coordination that was being facilitated by ""economics"" has broken down. If robots make everything but we don't share the wealth, nobody will be able to afford the robot-made $10 t-shirt either, so again, how we organize ourselves socioeconomically is getting in the way. If nobody can afford the $10 robot-made t-shirt, then nobody has a job, and nobody is building robots. Then people don't give a crap about ""the environment"" and it's a free for all that would make FishMahBoi blush. (Sorry, Fish. I had to.)


We'd need some kind of resource-sharing economy and twenty billion robots working to free up the humans for the opposite, some kind of eco-luxury utopia, but that's so unrealistic it's not worth mentioning, and there is no transition plan that exists that passes any kind of sniff test. For that kind of futurist utopia, we'd also need nearly-free, almost-infinite energy, because almost-infinite energy is the only thing that could even theoretically offset the limited resources we have from the Earth otherwise. Not enough clean water? Desalinate the ocean, a trillion gallons at a time. Not enough of a certain kind of element? Mine the landfills with nano-robots. Sounds cool in a book, but we're a hundred years away from that kind of technology, let alone the energy to make it all happen. We have more pressing problems in the foreground that may (will, if you ask me) prevent us from getting to the techno-utopia singularity of abundance and global happiness.  


It's sort of like the ""if pigs had wings, we could ship things with flying pigs"" or whatever, argument. Pigs don't have wings. We don't have free energy. We don't have an infinitely resource-full environment. We don't share the wealth. We have various kinds of immediate problems that are, some of them, getting worse by the day. They're getting worse by the day, and we're stalling because we can't adequately answer the question ""who benefits and who pays"". Because we'd all benefit, or we'll _all pay_. We built a system that doesn't let us _not_ ask that question. And that is the wrong question and the answer is incoherent. 


What's next? I think we'll see all kinds of shit as it hits the fan, and then once it is spread evenly across everything like a disgusting gloss of shit, that shit will decay into soil, and many, many years later humanity might have a second chance to organize ourselves, but by then we'll not have the benefit of the previously high energy return on energy investment dinosaur juice products, and the environment will be depleted for thousands and thousands of years. We move a ton of earth to get a few pounds of copper, but it wasn't like that before. I don't think the intermediate or near term choice is really up to us any more. We're too entrenched in our own personal, regional, national, and international shit to move, and in the meantime, we're doing damage to the living planet that is our life support system, and also running out of resources and energy that we can burn. Even if we had abundant, cheap oil again, we really shouldn't burn it. Even if the carbon in the atmosphere wasn't a problem, we are basically at peak-materiel and peak-energy. Mix them both, and you've got problems. (_And I'm not even mentioning various feedback loops, environmental or otherwise...) 


I don't consider myself an optimist. That much is probably quite clear. I do think that we are being our own worst enemy here, and I think it boils down to the question of who pays. We're all going to. That much is apparent. But that's not the ""right answer"" when the CEO or Mayor or President wants to hear. Whether through rising sea levels, or any of the dozens of other predicted or currently-unfolding maladies we're facing, we're all going to pay and dollars rapidly become irrelevant. Some (most?) will pay with their lives, and others with their pocketbooks, but eventually, nobody's pocketbook will stop the badger. (I should have picked a scarier animal if I'm going to keep using this analogy, hmm?) Instead, we argue about pronouns, and who hacked whom, and while these aren't completely irrelevant questions, **they will be if 80% of the places where human populations lived are under 50m of acidified oceans incapable of supporting marine life or sequestering carbon.** 


As an aside, it is also worth mentioning that _even if we went full-production on green energy, it might not be anywhere near enough to offset what we use on a daily basis with respect to electricity from all sources and energy directly from dinosaur juice products_. Not to mention dealing with the 3,000 gigatons of carbon we've already smoked up into the atmosphere. But, I'd personally rather we try to do _something_ even if it's a ""50%"" solution. I just don't see it happening. Because it's not really about the technical details - it's that we can't seem to even agree what the problem is right now. I still have arguments with people on a _daily basis_ about whether or not humans have an impact on the climate. 


Those people vote for politicians who don't want to ""see jobs go elsewhere."" And, I get it. In the meantime, what else do we have but the social organization we've built? If I want to eat, I work at a job. Shareholders fire CEOs who stop making them dollars. Our complex bureaucracies and social organizations are _not built to innovate_, and slow, incremental change will not happen fast enough to make enough difference before things are so wildly out of our hands that pure absurdity kicks in. Because at the end of the story, it isn't about 'whether or not solar panels have an EROEI of 8:1 or 3:1' if **we're not building enough of them anyway**. We can't even come to consensus about whether people are involved. Try organizing a debate purely on the technical basis of how we might engineer ourselves out of this problem, when people don't even want to talk about the problems, let alone agree on whether we caused them, or get to a foundational discussion about what we might do, in time. (And let's save discussions about techno-fixes for another thread, though that's where I want to go next...) 


It's a huge bill the table, hard earned from a month of non-stop, excessive drinking, jokes, and good times, and nobody wants to pitch in or even look at the tab. But, we're all going to pay one way or another. That much is inevitable.

**Prologue**
We are overpopulated, our planet is warming, our soil is being destroyed, our antibiotics are ineffective, the ecosystems we rely on are in turmoil. Humanity and civilization now face a life-or-death fight on many fronts. I believe we will endure a traumatic and extraordinary decline. But I also believe we also have extraordinary power to help ourselves, both individually and collectively.
As we learn more, the news can seem very scary. Some days inevitably, you will just want to panic, or cry, or give up, or deny it all.
Instead, I would like to tread the middle road of realism – and you can too. No matter how bleak the future, there are reasons to remain calm and fight for the future. Here are fifty that I thought of. Some are facts, others are feelings. I hope one or two might help you in your darkest moments. 

**1.Panicking doesn’t help.**
Panicking people don’t change anything, and they don’t enjoy themselves either. Don’t condemn yourself to that kind of life, when you can live it well, and still be part of the change.

**2. Earth will not explode.**
I know it’s ridiculous, but let’s start our perspective at the worst nightmare and work down.

I saw a cartoon of an exploding Earth once in an online column. It was probably a joke, but I want to tell you the ground is not going anywhere. Earth will stay a beautiful planet, oceans and all, for a billion years yet – and that’s a long time. Sometimes, thinking about that deep future brings me calm.

**3. Earth won’t turn into Venus.**
Sometimes speaking about climate change, one compares Earth to Venus. Venus is hotter than an oven, has no liquid water, and nothing can live there. But Venus has an atmosphere ninety times heavier than Earth’s, made of almost pure CO2. That’s 90,000 times more CO2 than even a greenhouse Earth. So trust me, if you didn’t know, we can’t turn Earth into Venus.

We also can’t reach the irreversible “moist greenhouse” state that has been posited as a similar end to life on Earth – not even if we burn all the fossil fuels.

**4. Earth has been here before.**
We know Earth has dozens of mass extinctions in its history, most associated with catastrophic sudden climate change. The worst we know of was the Permian-Triassic boundary – a ten-degree warming triggered by CO2, no less – that killed about ninety percent of all life. These events were terrible, but they were no-one’s fault.

Don’t think we are even the first life on Earth to change the climate. We’re not that exceptionally terrible. We just stumbled on something we shouldn’t have.

**5. Earth’s life will carry on.**
After every catastrophe, Earth’s life slowly recovered. Life, even complex life, is incredibly tenacious; it will hang on to the last. The Anthropocene extinction will decimate Earth’s rich biodiversity, but through speciation it will one day recover.
Sometimes I think about what Earth will look like in fifty million years. Regardless of human actions, I imagine a lush and beautiful wilderness full of plants and animals: a few you might recognize, and others strange and new. None of them will know or care what we did. In this important way, we will be forgiven. 

**6. Humans are of the Earth.**
We tend to think of ourselves as separate from nature, but we are animals, a part of the ecosystem. We’re related by blood to all other animals. Every species has in common a certain selfishness, a genetically-implanted desire to grow and consume. It’s not unique to us, and we can’t turn it off.
In the same competition as all our animal peers, we used an unusual resource to excel. It is who we are, and it is what it is. 

**7. We started in an ice age.**
Earth has been ice-free for 85% of its history. Starting with an ice-free Earth, we would have had far less room to emit CO2 before reaching a very hostile climate. So, given that we were destined to discover a billion years’ worth of fossil fuels and start lighting them up, we evolved at a (relatively) suitable time to do it. Let’s be thankful for small mercies. 

**8. The worst climate terror is far away.**
The most nightmarish scenario of all is “oceanic eunixia”, in which bacteria in the oceans release hydrogen sulphide gas which poisons life on land and sea, It has contributed to mass extinctions before. But we will never see it, and our descendants probably won’t either. Eunixia has only ever happened when CO2 levels were consistently above 1000 parts per million, which we’re not projected to manage. Even then it is far from certain, and if it happens it may not be worldwide, and in any case it wouldn’t start for ten thousand years. Don’t waste your nightmares on such distant possibilities – focus on more proximate concerns. 

**9. Some humans will probably carry on.**
In any event except severe eunixia (or a large meteor), I believe humans will persist after our civilization collapses. Before civilization we were already one of the most widespread animals on Earth. Our ingenuity, adaptability and ability to eat just about anything leads us to adapt to every climate, hot and cold. We’ve even endured sharp changes of climate before. The ecosystems we destabilized will reel and transform for millennia to come, but if we cover everywhere still inhabitable, is it silly to suggest a hardy few will make it through the turmoil? 

**10. We might have prolonged Earth’s life.**
A little ""bad science"" argument: geological weathering processes and fallen plants have progressively sequestered the world’s carbon – the latter is why we have fossil fuels in the first place, of course. Millions of years from now, this caching process will eventually annihilate CO2, prevent photosynthesis, and possibly cause the end of much life. If we have delayed this process, think of all the extra generations of future plant and animal life we might have permitted – an ironic blessing to tomorrow’s life, to partner the curse we bestow on today’s. 

**11. Our animal companions will accompany us.**
After humans, the more likely mammals to survive include the ones we have partnered with. Our symbiotic friendships with dogs, cats and horses has lasted millennia, and you find them just about everywhere you find you find humans. Any surviving humans will probably continue to benefit from the service and companionship of these animals. Consider some distant descendants of ours, confronting a challenging world with the aid of a faithful working dog. 

**12. You won’t live through it all.**
The full equilibration of Earth’s climate to its new warm state will take hundreds of years, and so – God willing – will humanity’s fight to survive it. So as you hear about all the terrible predictions of what will or might happen, understand that you won’t have to see them all. 

**13. We know what’s happening.**
Our knowledge of the world, while sadly incomplete, is colossal. We know about our own climate forcing and nature’s many feedback loops. Our predictions of the crisis’ progression improve every day even as we enter it. The knowledge that terrifies you, also terrifies the powerful who must act to mitigate it. Knowledge is the force for good against ignorant capitalism.
Imagine the contrary: had we remained in ignorance, and rapidly burned all the world’s fossil fuel reserves without a clue of what we were doing, we would have had nothing to do but weep and blame an angry God. 

**14. We are doing much about it.**
Our eleventh-hour fight against our CO2 emissions, while predictably late, is still massive and commendable. Science has laid bare the consequences, and politicians have finally listened. You may find the policy changes meagre, but they matter and they will grow. Also, we can’t deny that we’ve had a pulse of innovation including efficient and cheap renewable energy, power reduction of appliances, electric cars, “sustainable” building materials, and so on. It’s not enough to stop the warming, but it’s not bad. 

**15. Engineers can optimize for anything.**
Engineers have always optimized their creations – for minimum weight on a plane, or minimum cost on a mass-produced object. Now for some time they have also been optimizing for reduced embodied CO2 in materials and processes, and the savings matter. Don’t believe the exaggerated greenwash, but know that we tried. 

**16. What we have built can help us.**
As we face civilizational decline and fight to kill emissions, the infrastructure we have built will make it easier. It’s hardly utopian, but for example, if we can maintain the internet for some time, we might communicate during the decline (say, about which plants will grow) without spending invaluable emissions on travel, which will save lives or make them more bearable.
 
**17. Renewable energy is reality.**
A huge renewable energy capacity is now being created worldwide. Some, like solar panels, are localized. It is some comfort to me that even survivors of an acute crisis may, at least initially, have some sources of useful energy other than the deadly fossil fuels. 
 
**18. There are (limited) means for us to sequester carbon.**
If the crisis spins us into enough panic to act, there may be a little artificial mediation of the effects – like harvesting biomass and sequestering its carbon. It’s no solution, but it allows some faint hope of us undoing some of the catastrophe before its full effects arrive. This is slowly becoming technologically and politically viable, so if you have any faith in technology, you might like to place some here. 

**19. Technology is a good unknown.**
In general, technology created our problems and it won’t solve them, but one can still hope that some late-stage innovations reduce the final total, or rate, of CO2 released. For example, the explosive growth of renewable energy has exceeded all expectations, and will allow us to shut off fossil fuel plants a little earlier, if we are willing. The remarkable pace of innovation will have at least some effect on the shape and size of our carbon pulse – I do hope it is to the good. 

**20. You’re probably in the global elite.**
Ordinary citizens can’t much affect the path of our leadership in this crisis, but you can try to navigate your own way through it all. If you are a middle-class professional in a rich country like the US or Europe, you are probably in the global 1%, so however badly your own life will be affected this century, I guarantee you, other poor souls will have it worse. In dark times, be grateful for your advantages. 

**21. Social change can be rapid.**
I am often depressed by the lack of public awareness and agitation against climate change in the US and UK –rendered docile by cynical leaders and manipulative media, many of us seem to have accepted the offer to plug our ears and walk into the fire. But in most other countries the public care, and attitude can swing here too when we get a big enough scare. We will all care about this, very soon. 

**22. There are reasons for nations to work together.**
We have reached this lamentable place, with so much warming already and so much more unavoidably to come, because nations could not overcome their differences and avert the tragedy of the commons. Now though, this seems to be changing – because every nation has everything to lose. Any leader who loves their own land more than they hate others, now concludes that even at a national level, the best path is to urgently cut emissions. 

**23. There are economic reasons to reduce emissions.**
In a capitalist system, a low-carbon economy emerges when low-carbon technologies are cheaper than the alternatives. This is now true for energy sources, and that market force is stronger than political hand-wringing. Market foresight means investment money will flow to energy and transport solutions that are reducing in price, and will be cheaper in the future. The more we deconstruct the carbon economy, the greater the incentives will be.

**24. It is worth changing your lifestyle.**
Become more sustainable in your food, energy and transport consumption. Your individual contribution may be negligible – every big helps – but it will prepare you for a future when we have no choice, and set a valuable example to others.

**25. This fight will bring us purpose.**
In the developed world we have few material complaints, but often feel that our lives lack meaning. There is a reason for this: we are programmed to relish struggle. Fighting for humanity’s survival is the greatest struggle of all. Make it your cause.
Believe it or not, we do have a future. You have a future. 

**26. Hardship brings us together.**
We may be headed for hard times, and that brings enemies – we may be pitted against each other, and we will certainly be less safe. But we will also form strong alliances and communities, out of necessity if nothing else. These alliances will be of a depth you’ve never known before. We will band together, and in our groups, we will help each other. 

**27. There will be helpers.**
Terrible tragedies will happen this century, on a scale we have never seen before – but as Mr Rogers once said, in ever tragedy, look for the helpers. Look for those kind souls who try to respond and make things better, even if for a moment. They are humanity’s best face, and they are always there in the background.
Better yet, when the opportunity comes, be one. 

**28. We can learn from the old.**
Talk to the old, who have experienced war, and didn’t grow up in our period of privilege and safety. They have many lessons for you about how to survive and stay sane under impossible circumstances. 

**29. We grew in ignorance, but we will decline with wisdom.**
We may face, as least for now, a seemingly interminable backward march along the road of history. But there is one difference. The knowledge we have built in this era is like the great library of Alexandria, a million times over. Yes, some of it will burn and be forgotten, but some of it will help us in our fight to survive.  

**30. We will break our addiction to progress.**
The Idea of Progress is an 18th Century European invention – broadly, that technology improves the human condition. Two staggering world wars using technology did not free us from the ridiculous mentality that we can master the Earth with progress. But in the coming decline, dealing with catastrophic climate change of our own making, that day must finally arrive – all the better for our survival. 

**31. We will set an example for the next generations.**
We will teach them about the inevitability of decline and adaptation, and about the need for efficiency, frugality, and good use of those little resources that remain. We’re the first generation for a while to really know about this, but our philosophical shift may set the moral tone for a long time to come. 

**32. You aren’t “stealing” our children’s resources.**
You didn’t choose to live at this strange and decadent time, at the peak of such an unsustainable and destructive globalized society. You were born into it, just as your ancestors were born into your era, and your children are born into theirs. Just live lightly and prepare them for a depleted and chaotic future – this is the best thing you can do for them.  

**33. This crisis was always going to happen.**
From the moment we found coal, we were destined to meet climate change. Its potential has always been there, waiting to be unleashed. If not fossil fuels, agricultural emissions alone might have done it. And, resources consumed being related to population, our climate crisis was destined to coincide with a (similarly inevitable) crisis of overpopulation.

You have been chosen by fate to witness the long-anticipated moment that humans confront this great double-headed beast. We will respond as well as we can.

**34. Some collapse is desirable.**
Our culture is decadent, corrupt, and revels in an illusion of abundance. It’s not healthy, and in the end it hasn’t even made us that happy.
My distant hope is that one day, on a strange and warmer world, some people will get a chance to build again and live well for a while – but with the memory of our past follies seared into their flesh and culture, so that they hesitate to repeat them, for a while at least. That vision may seem unimaginably out of reach, but one may cling to it nevertheless – you never know how people find a way. 

**35. Collapse panic is not realism.**
By all means prepare yourself for a societal collapse, but don’t assume the worst will happen – this mentality is not logical, and it leads to dangerous conclusions and self-destructive actions. The hard road of realism means agitating for the best option, preparing for the worst, and above all, responding to changes as they come, to keep yourself alive and in the game. 

**36. Unsustainable lifestyles must stop anyway.**
“Unsustainable” means it was never going to be sustained. It’s that simple. The end of unsustainable life is not pleasant, but it is right. I think the waste of our age is barbaric, and globalization has ultimately failed us.

(On the other hand, our global interdependence, the one thing standing between us and a complete tragedy of the commons scenario, is still here for now and very difficult to undo.)

**37. We’ll understand things again.**
I am rather sick of living in a world of incomprehensible man-made complexity – technological, political, economic. One thing is for sure – if we are forced into a simpler world, it will have its dangers, but it will be one that doesn’t vex our minds in this way. We will understand a little more of the processes that shape our lives. 

**38. Our happiness adjusts to our circumstances.**
As a pampered First World citizen, the transition to decline can seem unimaginably tragic and frightening – if it’s not literally the end of the world, the end of our lifestyles may as well be. But think: our ancestors’ lives were much simpler, humbler and more precarious, sometimes violent, and yet they did find moments of joy in them. Under all but the most hopeless and painful circumstances, humans prefer to be alive. Remember: the end of growth does not mean the end of all human happiness. Find those moment of joy in your own life, and treasure them. 

**39. Expectations adjust to our means.**
We drive our cars to work, even though we know it slowly destroys the atmosphere. We do so because we are expected to: by the boss, by the government, by our peers. In this simple way, the continued destruction of nature has been ratcheted up, even by citizens who don’t really want to. Our means are so great in this golden age, but society has expectations of us to match. In decline, both will be cut away together – you’re only expected to do what you can. 

**40. Scientists need to scare people.**
When climate scientists reveal scary findings, they must frame them in a scary way. It’s the right thing for them to do. They themselves are scared, and they want important people to listen.
The target audience for this fear-mongering is more them than you (although public awareness is the key to convincing them). Once again, always remember it’s not up to you to solve the world’s insoluble problems – you’ve only got to endure them. This lesser task is difficult enough. Don’t take on burdens that aren’t yours. Let world events take their course, and respond. 

**41. Politicians are what they are.**
Instead of despairing at the inaction of politicians, accept them for what they are: corrupt, arrogant and sefish. They care about your welfare only inasmuch as it keeps them in power. You’re clever enough to know that.

But know that sometimes your future prospects coincide with theirs, and this grave global challenge might just be one of those times.

**42. The media want you to panic.**
The media has always known that the best way to control behaviour is by appeal to emotions, and the strongest of all is fear. Fearful readers are more susceptible to the distractions the media provides, namely bovine consumption and ignorance. So the media write all their articles in a sensationalist way, no matter which political stripe. Be aware of the facts, but don’t binge on media – you only hurt yourself. You don’t have to go along with their game. 

**43. You are strong.**
You are strong enough to live in the “desert of the real”, to understand the terrible troubles of the world and face them bravely, while focusing on your own life and negotiating through them. You are a survivor. You are prepared. You are strong. 

**44. Everything has an upside.**
As awful as it sounds… some of the impossible crises we face can mitigate the others. A trade war, as awful as it would be, would greatly reduce trade volumes and hence global CO2 emissions, buying the human race valuable time to migrate and adapt to new climates. A pandemic, as awful as that would be, would reduce overpopulation. It’s the grimmest argument I’ve ever thought of for optimism, but there it is. 

**45. Merriment is a renewable resource.**
In the darkest, toughest times, force a smile. Force yourself to dance and sing, create a little merriment with your loved ones and friends. It’s free, emits no carbon, and keeps our hopes alive for one more day. 

**46. Life is too long anyway.**
I won’t sugarcoat it: Collapse, or end-stage decline, means our lives will be shorter. Diseases will return to haunt us, violence will be more common, nourishment will be uncertain, there may be little if any medicine.
But on the other hand, our lives now in the West are blighted in any case by the great pain of old age. People are kept alive to the point where they hardly enjoy it any more. 

**47. Everyone dies one day.**
In your life, the worst that can happen to you is that you suffer and die. As our population must eventually decrease, this is indeed certain to happen to many people. But you can’t avoid death anyway! Everyone dies. The only thing you have to lose is comfort. Smile at the absurdity of life, and continue on your way. 

**48. Success and doom are not the only two options.**
Between the unlikely best-case scenario (green tech miracles and population stabilization in the West lead to a period of sustainable comfort) and the unlikely worst case scenario (rapid collapse, war, famine) there are many hypothetical outcomes. I’m sure you’ve considered them all. Maybe collapse will be followed by some rebuilding, or maybe we will have a long but stable decline under austere, authoritarian but stable rule. In most scenarios, you get to live some kind of life.
Our history isn’t written yet. Don’t waste your life-energy writing it. 

**49. No single action will doom or save us.**
No single event – election, natural disaster, climate change discovery for better or worse, whatever – will act alone in determining our fate. It is shaped by longer trends. So don’t panic at each day’s news, even if it’s very bad. Larger, longer trends are what matters. 
And once again remember, there are 7 billion individual stories to be written, they’re not all the same, and yours is unlikely to be the worst. 

**50. We’re all in this together.**
Don’t face this alone. Everyone on Earth must face this awful future, and it’s on all of our minds. Share your pain with your loved ones, and share love and comfort each other. Be happy, whenever you can.  

---

**Epilogue**
The message of this post is not simply “stop thinking about climate change and overpopulation”. That would be silly: The rest of our lives will be dominated by this, it will touch everyone, some severely, some will die. It’s not your fault that you’re in this, but you can learn to accept it. Meld your fear with hope to make determination, resilience and resolve. Both individually and collectively, the more we think, act and prepare, the better we’ll do.

I’m ready. Let’s go.

"5ktxmy","collapse","skeptical","If you want to know why solar won't save us, just look at Germany.","Germany added [0.9 GW of solar capacity in the first ten months of 2016.](http://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/london/germany-adds-109-mw-new-solar-in-october-but-26609004) In 2015 it added 1.5 GW of solar capacity. How do those numbers compare to previous years? Look for yourself [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Germany_Solar_Capacity_Added.png). Ask yourself this: If solar is now so ridiculously cheap and destined to become our main energy source, why has Germany stopped installing new capacity?

The answer is: Solar is subject to diminishing returns. An estimated 32% of Germany's electricity is green. Out of this, [20% is produced using solar panels](http://www.energymatters.com.au/renewable-news/germany-renewable-energy-em5834/). That's 6.4% of the electricity supply. It has been hovering in the 6-7% of electricity band for years now, they've hit a limit beyond which diminishing returns prohibit further expansion.

Why is that? The main reason is because solar is intermittent. [Here](https://carboncounter.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/solar2014_daily2.png) you can see the daily output. It becomes clear that most of the year solar doesn't produce sufficient electricity. In addition, if you happen to suffer a few cloudy days in the summer, those days produce a fraction of the electricity you would expect. This brings us back to the old problem, that biomass and fossil fuels also produce their own storage medium, whereas solar and wind don't.

There's reason to believe that even the current share of 6-7% of electricity that Germany has reached is not sustainable. First of all, Germany has the ability to export its excessive electricity to other countries. However, as other European countries now build up their own photovoltaic capacity, they'll have no need for the electricity that Germany dumps on the market.

Second, the current share was built up through use of large subsidies. As these subsidies are now being cut, it becomes increasingly expensive to replace panels that break down. Finally, the present situation is proving unsustainable for Germany's power companies. RWE seems to face the risk of [imminent bankruptcy](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/ratifying-paris-sweden-approves-sale-vattenfalls-german-lignite/final-days-rwe), as do the other big German power companies. These companies suffer [severe losses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-09/eon-posts-record-loss-on-german-power-plant-writedowns) every year, amounting to billions of euros. EON is posting its [third consecutive](http://www.dailysabah.com/energy/2016/11/10/eon-posts-6b-euro-loss-after-overvaluing-fossil-fuels-spin-off) multibillion euro loss this year. This situation can't be sustained for very long.","2016-12-29 01:13:11","8","26","0.66","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5ktxmy/if_you_want_to_know_why_solar_wont_save_us_just/","True","-triggerexpert-","1747948334.9229922","green energy transition","manual"
