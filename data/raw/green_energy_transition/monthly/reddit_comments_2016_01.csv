"cyx9myz","t3_40rwqw","40rwqw","collapse","skeptical","There will definitely not be any collapse.  These are some Guy McPherson figures here: assuming the worst case scenario and then some for every factor, and then counting the feedback loops multiple times over. 

Basically, none of these studies account for intermediary changes in science and technology; they all assume business as usual for the next twenty years, which we'll have anything but.  Yes, we may have an economic collapse of sorts, and it may be very difficult, but we will also learn a great deal, be forced to fundamentally restructure the economy, and be back on our feet less than a decade later (i.e. the Great Depression).  

We are predicted to move away from oil, coal and gas extremely quickly, to the extent that it's shocking even Al Gore.  Electric cars, lab grown meat, self driving cars (which reduces automobile numbers significantly), AI efficiency, GMOs (that can grow in all kinds of environments, including vertical farms that are already being built), desalinization and much much more are going to push back our day or reckoning much faster than it will approach -- by any metric.  

I was a collapser once, but then began conducting real research rather than just looking for evidence that tried to spell out doom.  The future will be like the past and the present, filled with daunting hardships (remember when AIDS, crack, the hole in the ozone layer, or gangs, were all spelling out the end of the world), but we will continue to endure.  Please forestall your suicides and surprise yourself with what's yet to come.","2016-01-13 23:31:10","2","bil3777","1747928814.057054","green energy transition","manual"

No, because hydro is classified as renewable, and it alone supplies 2.2% of worldwide energy. Biomass also has a considerable portion (like 11% or something). You may be thinking of wind and solar, which provide 2-3% of total primary energy. 

According to [this source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy), renewables were 19% of total energy in 2012.","2016-01-13 01:02:52","7","stumo","1747929037.7328892","green energy transition","manual"

I have heard about a very great Sufi mystic woman, Rabia al-Adawia. One evening, people found her sitting on the road searching for something. She was an old woman, her eyes were weak, and it was difficult for her to see. So the neighbours came to help her.

They asked, ‘What are you searching for?’

Rabia said, ‘That question is irrelevant, I am searching. If you can help me, help.’

They laughed and said, ‘Rabia, have you gone mad? You say our question is irrelevant, but if we don’t know what you are searching for, how can we help?’

Rabia said, ‘Okay. Just to satisfy you, I am searching for my needle, I have lost my needle.’

They started helping her — but immediately they became aware of the fact that the road was very big and a needle was a very tiny thing.

So they asked Rabia, ‘Please tell us where you lost it — the exact, precise place. Otherwise it is difficult. The road is big and we can go on searching and searching forever. Where did you lose it?’

Rabia said, ‘Again you ask an irrelevant question. How is it concerned with my search?’
They stopped. They said, ‘You have certainly gone crazy!’

Rabia said, ‘Okay. Just to satisfy you, I have lost it in my house.’

They asked, ‘Then why are you searching here?’

And Rabia is reported to have said, ‘Because here there is light and there is no light inside.’""","2016-01-18 22:21:31","1","[deleted]","1747929532.5526521","green energy transition","manual"

With abundant energy that is very, very cheap we can recycle steel, aluminum and even generate synthetic fuel from sea water and energy.

The truth is that we have enough energy from nuclear fission to get us to nuclear fusion.  We have enough energy for 10 billion people ""living at the British standard of living of the year 2009"".
