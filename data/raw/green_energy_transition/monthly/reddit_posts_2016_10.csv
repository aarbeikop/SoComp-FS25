"56nt23","sustainability","action-oriented","is there anyone here willing to do the math to determine if society can exist while still ""green""?","Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone who is interested in a ""green"" society is also willing to look under the hood to calculate whether we can still enjoy today's standard of living while also eliminating the use of fossil fuels.

Please let me know if you are willing to investigate - so far I find that people who have a desire to have a ""green"" society also haven't done the math on it, and I want to see if this holds true here.

I'm not looking for a debate from people who aren't interested in the math, so if that's you, hold your comments.  If you are interested in the math, please reply.

Thanks!","2016-10-09 19:28:43","4","57","0.69","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/56nt23/is_there_anyone_here_willing_to_do_the_math_to/","True","Kill_All_The_Humans","1747946414.853517","green energy transition","manual"
