"ekje4pn","t3_bbiot3","bbiot3","climatechange","action-oriented","The consequences of sucking all that CO2 back in with some magical tech is certainly interesting! For background here, I'm doing a PhD in polar climate science.

While we've studied a world without anthropogenic warming quite a lot, we haven't really (to my knowledge) studied the climate in a world after large scale carbon sequestration (I suspect because climatologically it would be fairly similar to a world in which it never warmed). 

That's not to say we haven't done irreparable damage to the biosphere etc! We've lost so much biodiversity and it won't come back if the earth cools, because it took millions of years to evolve.

The current thinking is that sea ice loss is reversible so long as we don't destroy the winter ice. I suspect desertification and glacier loss are generally reversible as a function of CO2 levels.

Intuitively I think the world would immediately begin to cool a bit, because outgoing thermal energy would no longer be stopped.

However, global warming has already changed the earth's characteristics (ie diminished frozen stuff reflects less light). But I think eventually we would replenish that albedo, but not immediately.

A good general rule for the layman is not to worry about mini (or full) ice ages, we have more pressing problems from the climate.","2019-04-10 10:58:31","10","FIST_IT_AGAIN_TONY","1747977998.802201","green energy transition","manual"
