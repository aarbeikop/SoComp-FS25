"d6xr7t7","t3_4zppci","4zppci","environment","emotional","> I've recycled for a long time so that's something. I'm also thinking about going vegan to prevent agriculture emissions.

These are both great stops. The benefits to recycling are obvious. I'd totally recommend you transition to [vegetarian and ultimately veganism](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Plates.gif). 

I was an omnivore for 22 years before realising the impact of animal agriculture. I switched to vegetarianism overnight painlessly and transitioned to veganism over the next few months.

> So what are some things that I can realistically do to help make real change? And if there isn't anything then what are some things I can do at my house to help?

The other biggest impact you can have is via engaging in your political culture to support environmental causes. Most democratic countries have green parties of sort, support of their movements helps strengthen green politics.","2016-08-26 17:27:27","5","SkeeverTail","1747943648.037565","green energy transition","manual"

Second best is to not eat beef.


After that: don't buy anything meant to be used once and then discarded.  Avoid all plastics.  Drive less.  Recycle anything that you must discard, as much a spossible.  Encourage local businesses to reduce / reuse / recycle.","2016-08-26 19:20:05","4","fevertronic","1747943648.0387042","green energy transition","manual"
"d6xxuk4","t3_4zppci","4zppci","environment","emotional","I agree with the ideas of eating less meat, or even none at all (vegan); and recycling, and not owning a car, or using cars less.   
   
But if we have perhaps far less time than we thought, and in consequence we should, now, be doing far more drastic things to avert a true climate catastrophe, I propose we more radically change our individual behaviour.
Such as buying less: participating in the corporate economy less. What I mean is not falling for all the bullshit useless products and services that we are being programmed to want and ""need"".   
Buy your food from local stores, or locally owned restaurants. Not from the big corporate chains. Don't buy stuff that has palm oil in it. Stop watching television, most of it is junkfood for your mind anyways, and it is just an avenue for the corporations to program you further in buying more and more of their bullshit stuff that you really don't need anyways. Live simply. Save your money. ","2016-08-26 19:50:38","4","xedd","1747943648.0402849","green energy transition","manual"
"d6y5qyd","t3_4zppci","4zppci","environment","emotional","Local politics is where most of the action happens.  Every state will have some kind of public utilities board with significant power over energy development.  Decisions made there about net metering and whether to pay the wholesale or retail rate can sink or encourage solar power.  Cities and counties control zoning and infrastructure that could help or hurt alternative transportation, along with building codes that set standards for energy efficiency.","2016-08-26 23:00:02","4","[deleted]","1747943648.041365","green energy transition","manual"

I hope you do go vegan and make changes yourself, and then be a vocal advocate informing people about the importance of these issues. Change will feel slow, and it will be frustrating at times, but these changes do take place gradually if there are people who care enough to make it happen.","2016-08-26 19:24:30","3","AbraSLAM_Lincoln","1747943648.04256","green energy transition","manual"

"d6y5qdi","t3_4zppci","4zppci","environment","emotional","I understand your frustration, sometimes it seems like it is you against the world. I would recommend looking for like-minded people offline. Maybe there is an environmental group that organizes events and protests that you could join. Being together with people that have the same view will strengthen your determination and together you can come up with the greatest ideas.

Where I live a group of people made deals with supermarkets to pick up food that is being thrown away. They collect it all at one spot and it is free for everyone to take. Whatever is leftover gets turned into compost. Its a place where everyone from the neighbourhood is welcome. They also have their own garden. I recommend you start growing your own food as well. Besides turning vegan, you should buy as much local as you can and support local farmers against the tyranny of Monsanto.

Go against consumerism, try to make things yourself (DIY). Its great to do and it saves lots of money!","2016-08-26 22:59:35","1","JasminDuyong","1747943648.044773","green energy transition","manual"
