"dib9gp4","t3_6ejwvv","6ejwvv","climatechange","action-oriented","In the UK, a family home needs a solar PV panel that provides about 3kW of electricity, costing between £4,000 and £6,000 (~$5k-$8k) covering about 21 sq m of roof space in **today's money** and at retail prices.  Buying in bulk and at warehouse prices, that would be about £2000 per household.

There are ~25 million households in the UK.

If the UK government mandated PV microgeneration, the total cost would be about £50 billion, approximately the same as the UK military budget, and less than 2% of GDP.  By contrast, a single UK rail line upgrade (High Speed 2) is projected to cost more than this at £55 billion. 

This is an achievable figure and realistic with today's technologies, let alone future technologies.

The gaps can be filled with Wind generation, a resource the UK has in vast quantities.

What we really need is a government that thinks big.","2017-06-01 11:27:51","2","almost_not_terrible","1747954114.2365582","green energy transition","manual"

Solar /wind /tidal /hydro are great for residential and commercial uses, and should be built to cover all of those. Unfortunately, we need something that can scale up faster to feed the machine of consumption. Plus, we need to look at grabbing some extra-planetary resources soon and fusion would help a lot with that.
