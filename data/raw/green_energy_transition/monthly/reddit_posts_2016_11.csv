"5aip84","science","scientific","American Chemical Society AMA: Hi! I am Amanda Morris, an Assistant Professor of Energy Chemistry at Virginia Tech. Ask me anything about how to make solar energy competitive!","Hi Reddit! My name is Amanda Morris and I am a Professor of Chemistry at Virginia Tech. I serve as an ACS Expert in the field of sustainable energy (https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/experts/amanda-morris.html).   This is my second AMA on this topic – you can see my biography and that session’s discussion via https://redd.it/3hfja5


Some of the questions people had last year concerned:


how does artificial photosynthesis work; 
how do the various semiconductor materials used in solar energy work;
how does the electrical grid design affect solar energy potentials; 
how does energy storage technology play a role with solar uptake?


I’m happy to answer more about these topics and any others that come to mind. Ask me anything about solar energy!


I will return at 11 am ET (8am PT, 3pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!

(10:50 EST) Hey y'all! I am signed on and replying! I am pumped to see so many comments already!

(1:00 EST) Great time answering your questions! The biggest themes were when is solar cost effective for me, solar cell recycling and life cycle analysis, and Tesla's solar relevant technologies. There are calculators to consider the first point - http://www.solar-estimate.org/ is just one example. First Solar is now recycling solar cell modules for large installations - great news! And, Tesla continues to push the envelope, but the cost effectiveness of such technoogies isn't proven yet.

Thanks all! Sorry, I didn't get to most of your questions! Until next time!
