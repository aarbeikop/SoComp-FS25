"dcl3cv","sustainability","action-oriented","Reevaluating “staying in mom’s basement”","Long story short, I am in Canada , quit my oil and gas job to transition to this field. Started a NGO to do local green projects, but facing lot of bureaucratic obstacles. Finances going tight as well. I feel like going back home (India) and just stay with parents and be the SIMB guy for a while. My parents would be super upset, as my dad thinks any non corporate life is a loser life (coming from pro economic growth at all cost mindset) So convincing them is super tough. 

I feel this is justifiable from sustainability lens. I will have super low footprint, just do green research and work on community projects and more mental peace due to low cost of living. 

My main point is SIMB should be destigmatized and is one of many strategies to mitigate/adapt for climate change.

Edit: I already asked my parents but they strongly disagree as my dad wants corporate status quo at all cost and also he thinks I will end up single forever, and he wants me to get married as well. I have given up on convincing them. So let’s separate that from sustainability discussion.","2019-10-03 03:03:26","13","14","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dcl3cv/reevaluating_staying_in_moms_basement/","True","zenneutral","1747985180.779456","green energy transition","manual"

Google announced plans to spend $150 million on renewable energy projects, looking to use the funding to bring green initiatives to the countries where its products are made.

The tech giant didn't say whether it would spend the funds through direct investments, power-purchase agreements (PPA) or other means.","2019-10-21 14:27:23","1","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Renewable/comments/dl1bw2/google_announced_plans_to_spend_150_million_on/","True","team_pv","1747985273.47264","green energy transition","manual"
