I have a two-part question concerning communication with non-scientists, the first is specific to the Green Chemistry Institute, the second more general.   

* (1) **What kind of training does the Green Chemistry Institute provide to chemists to facilitate their communication with non-scientists?**

* (2) Part of the American Chemistry Society's mission is outreach to non-chemists and non-scientists.  Yet when my University was hiring for a tenure-track position, we had the hardest time finding a chemist who can talk to non-scientists about her/his work without descending into jargon and not even realizing it.  And we had lots of otherwise really good candidates.  So my question is: **Does ACS have anything in the works to train academic chemists about how to talk to non-chemists about their work?** 

I can appreciate that chemistry is a very technical science, but I see this as an indication that communication with non-scientists is not considered a priority in the Chemistry community.  I see the same problem with Mathematics community as well, though many Physics people have shown themselves quite successful in communicating the big picture and excitement about their work.","2015-08-04 13:29:17","6","weaselword","1747919228.1875389","green energy transition","manual"

My question is this:  There used to be a lot of research going on up until the '90s involving the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The idea was that petroleum shouldn't be our only hydrocarbon feedstock, and methane is an abudant, cheap and renewable alternative.  While it is true that alternative fuels are on the rise in the automotive and energy industries, do you believe that there is still value in pursuing alternative feedstocks like OCM?

I was just curious on what you think it will take for a paradigm shift towards more 'green' technologies, like advanced battery tech, renewable energy, nuclear power etc.

One aspect of the debate certainly seems to be ""what you get out"" for ""what you put in"", which is something we see in a lot of battery tech or fuel cell production where the energy output is either too low or the resources required to make the final product are too wasteful.
