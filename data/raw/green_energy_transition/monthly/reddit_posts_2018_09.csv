I've been on a reading kick lately, and I've been looking for a good book (textbook or otherwise) on sustainable designs, renewable energy, or urban development with sustainability in mind. I have a couple books on this topic, but they jump all over the place with ideas (such as ecosystem engineers, etc.).

 If you have any reading that you recommend that either talks about an obscure practice in this field, or is just something that everyone should read, please recommend it below. Thanks!","2018-09-21 16:15:26","26","14","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/9hrh7p/book_recommendations_for_sustainable_design/","True","THAT_CHURRO_GUY","1747971102.094389","green energy transition","manual"
