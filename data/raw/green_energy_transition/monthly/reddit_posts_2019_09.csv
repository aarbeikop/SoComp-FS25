"d6i6y0","collapse","skeptical","Solving climate change is easy","The world has to reach zero CO2 emissions by 2060. How is this accomplished?

All we need to do is switch from coal and natural gas, to renewable electricity.

And then we need to shift from combustion engines to cars that drive on electricity.

And [to avoid rare mineral shortages](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/107058/uk-electric-cars-will-require-twice-the-world-s-supply-of-cobalt), we will probably have to convince some people to stop driving and switch to public transport.

And air travel will have to be a thing of the past, because battery energy density would need to improve by [two orders of magnitude](http://energyskeptic.com/2019/why-arent-there-battery-powered-airplanes/), to allow us to fly on electricity.

And we'll have to transition to [electric trucks](http://energyskeptic.com/2015/all-electric-trucks-not-going-to-happen/).

And then we'll have to power the world's big freight ships with sails or some other alternative method.

But then we can stop depending on fossil fuels for electricity and transportation.

We would then need to figure out a way to [stop using coal in our steel production](https://www.ft.com/content/3bcbcb60-037f-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1).

We'd have to shift the global concrete industry to a method that doesn't emit CO2, as [4% of global CO2 emissions are just from the chemical process we use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_concrete#Carbon_dioxide_emissions_and_climate_change).

The heavy manufacturing we do would have to shift too. We'll have to use roughly [two to three](http://ourrenewablefuture.org/chapter-5/) times more energy to generate the electricity that will power our heat intensive manufacturing processes, than the fossil fuels that we currently use.

But all of that should be a cakewalk. Now we can start focusing on the other problems, that will also have to be tackled. Cattle and other animals emit methane and lead to other greenhouse gas emissions, so people will have to change their diets. Beef consumption in the EU will have to [decline by 90%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown) before 2050. Instead, these people will have to start eating nuts and legumes.

We'll probably have to [stop using plastic](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180801182009.htm), because it emits greenhouse gasses when it decays in the sun, or simply ends up as carbon in our atmosphere when we burn it. The plastic we have already released into the environment will just continue to leach greenhouse gasses into our atmosphere. I'll skip over the health and ecological effects beyond the impact on global warming.

Another 3% of our current global CO2 emissions come from [coal fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-seam_fire). You dig a mine in the ground, some coal enters in contact with the air, then it can spontaneously ignite when the conditions are right. What determines whether a coal deposit exposed to the air will spontaneously ignites? The ambient temperature. Ouch. As we expose more coal deposits to the air through mining activities, plenty of such fires are likely to occur around the world, so we will want firefighting teams to address these underground fires too. We want the same to happen to the [peat fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat#Peat_Fires), which occur spontaneously in response to new weather patterns that bring extreme heats to places not used to extreme heat.

Most of the coral reefs start dying [before we hit 1.5 degree Celsius](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1674), so we'll have to implement some sort of weather modification program too, or artificially rebuild the coral reefs, assuming we want to feed the hundreds of millions of people who depend on the reefs and preserve the species that inhabit the reef. We'll probably need [some sort of geoengineering program in the Arctic](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48069663) too, to reverse the positive feedback of sea ice loss.

We'll have to implement [conservation programs](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190725100433.htm), to revive the dying elephant populations in Africa that ensure the African forests store high amounts of carbon dioxide.

There are some minor long-lived greenhouse gasses we'll have to stop using too, like [sulphur hexafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride#Greenhouse_gas). We'll also have to get rid of CFC's and HFC's.

Because we've waited too long with reducing CO2 emissions, we'll also need to develop negative emissions technologies that will have to be deployed somewhere in the latter half of this century. There are none we know of today that have been conclusively shown to be feasible, but perhaps we'll think of some.

TL:DR; It's pretty easy, get rid of the fossil fuel subsidies, vote for your local green party, become a flexitarian, recycle your plastic, fly to a vacation destiny nearby and the problem is solved.","2019-09-19 18:31:09","53","18","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d6i6y0/solving_climate_change_is_easy/","True","baibaiguis","1747983749.8896809","green energy transition","manual"
"d87hwb","collapse","skeptical","Contrarian: France Bans plastic cutlery and plates","This is probably too little and too late but at least it's a start.  The plastic bag ban has taken effect in many countries but utensils and plates account for plenty of plastic waste.

France's population is decent sized so if they cut back so drastically plastic use, it's bound to have some impact.

At the very least the French will be prepared to deal with the decreased availability of plastic when the worldwide economy collapses and plastic manufacturing tanks.

 **France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery** 

 **By** [**James McAuley**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/james-mcauley/)**September 19, 2016**

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s [Energy Transition for Green Growth Act](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/14123-8-GB_loi-TE-mode-emploi_DEF_light.pdf), the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

 

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

 

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the [Associated Press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/54a14fa0bee742618906007606a39166/france-bid-adieu-plastic-dishes-controversial-ban) that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.","2019-09-23 14:46:14","78","15","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d87hwb/contrarian_france_bans_plastic_cutlery_and_plates/","True","Ar-Q-bid","1747983751.240512","green energy transition","manual"
"d5g1z9","sustainability","action-oriented","If you're going to the #ClimateStrike in the U.S....","Consider making the most out of your time there by [volunteering with the Environmental Voter Project](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved) asking attendees to [sign the Environmental Voter Pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge) and commit to casting an environmentally-responsible vote in every election in which they are eligible to vote. Once a person commits to being an Environmental Voter, EVP will send them elections reminders ahead of all upcoming elections they are eligible to vote in (I've received a couple texts since I signed up last year).

Between municipal elections, state elections, national elections, primaries, and generals, most Americans are probably eligible to vote in [3 or 4 elections per year](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/news/millions-environmentalists-are-registered-vote-us-dont-what-if-they-did). Since [lawmakers *only* care what voters want, and ignore the concerns of nonvoters](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x), you can [raise the power and the profile of environmentalism by participating in every election, even the minor ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s), because [algorithms are powerful tools for extracting priorities from the electorate](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/02/15/voter-files-study-qa/), and it's possible to determine from publicly available information (with [89% accuracy](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf)) if you prioritize climate change or the environment. If EVP can do it, so can lawmakers. 

Why voting is critical to the climate movement: [We need systemic change](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/) (e.g. as the most recent IPCC report made clear, [pricing carbon is not optional](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf)) if we want any chance of meeting our targets, and as we've recently seen lawmakers who don't value the environment will act to dismantle existing environmental protection laws.
