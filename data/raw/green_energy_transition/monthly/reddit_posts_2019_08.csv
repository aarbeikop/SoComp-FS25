The only difference between 1987 and 2017 is that we added 3% more energy in the form of solar and wind power.

World energy transitions take 3 generations to do, that's 75 years.

We have to reduce emissions 100% in 20-30 years. We have no **real** idea how to do this and most of our green energy is fraud. We got 30 years to change everything, here's what we accomplished over the last 30 years of fighting climate change.

If you are 30 years old, emissions went up 60% in your lifetime.

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% in your lifetime.

As you can see, our only success has been bullshit. If you think Bernie Sanders is going to save us in any way shape or form, then fine; but I don't see any difference between believing Bernie Sanders or Jesus Christ. I'd rather drop LSD or mescaline.

>The validity of the green growth discourse relies on the assumption of an absolute, permanent, global, large and fast enough decoupling of economic growth from all critical environmental pressures. The literature reviewed clearly shows that **there is no empirical evidence for such a decoupling currently happening**. This is the case for materials, energy, water, greenhouse gases, land, water pollutants, and biodiversity loss for which decoupling is either only relative, and/or observed only temporarily, and/or only locally. In most cases, decoupling is relative. When absolute decoupling occurs, it is observed only during rather short periods of time, concerning only certain resources or forms of impact, for specific locations, and with very small rates of mitigation.

>Our latest view – based on a bottom-up, asset-based, investor-led perspective – is something nearly no other company can do. It is based on fundamentals and objective thinking. It is supplemented by our relationships across every major asset class, government and demand segment. It is a result of our teams pushing the cost technologies and adoption rates as much as we think possible, given the inertia already embedded within multiple business cycles. What emerged is a conservative outlook: *one in which the current pathway looks more like 3 degree of warming than the 2 degrees or lower advocated in Paris*.

Do The Math (Using physics and estimation to assess energy, growth, options—by Tom Murphy):  [The Energy Trap](https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/10/the-energy-trap/) 

>In brief, the idea is that once we enter a decline phase in fossil fuel availability—first in petroleum—our growth-based economic system will struggle to cope with a contraction of its very lifeblood. Fuel prices will skyrocket, some individuals and exporting nations will react by hoarding, and energy scarcity will quickly become the new norm. The invisible hand of the market will slap us silly demanding a new energy infrastructure based on non-fossil solutions. But here’s the rub. The construction of that shiny new infrastructure requires not just money, but…**energy**. And that’s **the very commodity in short supply**. Will we *really* be willing to sacrifice *additional* energy in the short term—effectively steepening the decline—for a long-term energy plan? It’s a trap! 

&#x200B;

It should also be noted that the energy and materials costs of *materials themselves* are rising: one has to dig deeper to extract more ore of lesser quality and it takes more effort to refine it, for example.

This means that, over time *a growing proportion* of all available energy and materials has to be used for producing (probably *more)* energy and materials. *A shrinking proportion* is available for maintaining existing infrastructure and building new, and for discretionary ""luxuries"".

On top of that, the environmental degradation and the increasingly anomalous and chaotic climate put an additional energy and materials burden on our systems.

In short, it's a death spiral. It seems *an awful lot* that we are indeed **fucked**.

Or, I could have misunderstood something. What do you think?

When a city and its neighborhoods are able to provide leisure for the residents, it displays some affluence. The arts, notable nightlife, museums, and sports entertainment are just some traits of Pittsburgh. The cultural district, which is located downtown, has flourished in the revitalization. Venues such as Heinz Hall and the Benedum are home to performing art shows, and Pittsburgh’s Symphony Orchestra. Surrounding neighborhoods such as: The Strip District, Southside, Oakland, and the North Shore provide the city with other forms of education and varying forms of entertainment. These neighborhoods can vary drastically, as you can see from the comparison from The Strip District and Oakland. The Strip district is a current hot-spot for developers, maintaining the areas old-brick warehouse theme,  “For many city-dwellers the Strip is rapidly becoming a touchstone of hip urban living - where the ceilings are high, the windows are tall, and luxurious spaces can still be rented or purchased for a reasonable price. (URA) The Strip is an area where on a Saturday morning, hundred of vendors can be found selling unique merchandise. Where as, Oakland is home to many of the city’s museums, libraries and colleges. The student-residential theme makes for a very diverse and enlightened community. However, not all parts of Pittsburgh are as bright, diverse and promising as these areas.
 
​Problems such as social inequalities due to race still exist in Pittsburgh.  The Hill district, described by “Pittsburgh’s City Living”, is Pittsburgh’s African-American cultural center. The segregation of this area cannot be ignored, and is noted as a low-income area for the black community. There has been a whole entire book on the topic of social inequalities in Pittsburgh, entitled, “Race and Renaissance: African American’s In Pittsburgh Since World War II.”  However, the article I read upon the topic disputes the credibility of the book due to it’s outdated sources. The article even argued that the city’s planning included diverse demographics by stating “The Pittsburgh Renaissance, intended to breathe new life into a polluted city exhausted by industry, became the crucible for upheaval in the city’s African American population. Although frequently interpreted as “urban renewal for Whitey,” both whites and blacks participated in the planning process.”(Levis) Programs such as “Pittsburgh Promise” works to integrate and diversify Pittsburgh’s community in a positive fashion. Ridding a city of social issues plays a large role in the urban development. The earlier negative effects of pollution and smog resulted in lower-class citizens receiving the hardship of the repercussions due to the local governments neglect for the cities citizens.
 
​The future of Pittsburgh is bright, and the envy of many city’s that are trying to move from their industrial past. This would be acknowledged as the transitioning period out of the industrial era. Macionis, and Parrillo state that the reasons behind post-industrial development are due to the growth of white-collared jobs, and the way companies do business. Pittsburgh has “an unemployment rate nearly 2 percentage points lower than the national average, 1,600 technology companies and a growing population.”(Bobkoff) The city was deemed “The Most Livable City” in 2013. This is due to characteristics in our booming technology field, historical value, affordable housing, top-class hospitals, prestigious college’s, cultured media-outlets, and newfound progressive movements into green space. (Schoker) When a city is established and structured, they have room to make innovative strides. There has been a recent rise of educated families moving into the city; oppose to sprawling into the suburbs. Noticeable areas include some pre-automobile areas surrounding the city. North-Side is a main example, and this can be accredited due to the hospital in the area. The integration and diverse blend of wealth promotes a better sociological urban environment. Some other benefits of being established include environmental factors, such as transforming Schenley Park into a “green oasis” and becoming an award-winning sustainable project. Events such as G20, a conference that connects many governments, have been held in Pittsburgh recently. When a city is able to self-improve due to the businesses and public sectors within, the potential for growth and globalization is outstanding.
 
​The question proposed is: what constitutes an urban area as sustainable? By definition, a sustainable city is deemed as, ““A sustainable city, or eco-city (also ""ecocity"") is a city designed with consideration of environmental impact, inhabited by people dedicated to minimization of required inputs of energy, water and food, and waste output of heat, air pollution - CO2, methane, and water pollution.” (Register). In layman’s terms, it’s a city that would work with citizens, government, and private sectors to make less of a negative environmental impact on the world. There are many proactive suggestions that can lead to enabling a better sustainable realm in Pittsburgh. Sustainable development, or (SD), has a rather comprehensive theoretical framework. Yosef Jabareen explains, “It encompasses different concepts such as environmental, social and economic justice, social equity, quality of life, freedom, democracy, participation and empowerment. Broadly, sustainability is seen as a matter of distributional equity, about sharing the capacity for well being between current and future generations of people” (Jabareen). The main idea is to form an eco-city, which are energy efficient and designed for a long life.","2019-08-28 23:57:50","3","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cwt153/pittsburgh_pa_a_case_study_pt_2/","True","toolatetobeoriginal","1747982885.006848","green energy transition","manual"
"cxx96j","sustainability","action-oriented","Pittsburgh, PA: A Case Study Pt.5","Carolan states, “Yet it is more than just its links to pollution that makes transportation a fascinating subject for sociologist. We often think about transportation as a response to changes in society is organized. […] we drive because our urban environments require us to. Yet the data tell precisely the opposite story. Urban and community patterns have taken the shape they have because of available transportation systems. The car, for example, made certain patterns of urbanization possible- patterns that, not surprisingly are found today to be difficult to service under alternative transportation forms. Thus, although many urban environments leave us with little choice but to drive (Carolan 135).”
 
​Pittsburgh Office of Sustainability proposes these solutions to alleviate the problems that transit causes within the city. On the home front, they recommend utilizing mass transit such as buses, the T, and other forms of public transportation to get to where you need to be going. Pittsburgh has many pre-automobile communities that enable people to walk to their desired designation. The way that businesses can be involved, as we have seen their large influence in the cities development is to encourage their workers to carpool to work. The city of Pittsburgh implemented an HOV lane, or a High Occupancy Vehicle Lane, or HOV Lane, is used to reduce congestion along Interstate 279, the Parkway North, by promoting ridesharing via carpooling. This reduces the amount of cars on the road, as a result of the suburban flight. Restrictions such as two people per car, motorcyclist, and buses are the only permitted vehicles to use this lane. It advocates for lower congestion that causes pollution, and less cars on the road. Lastly, Pittsburgh implemented a “Bike Pittsburgh” program that endorses people to get on bikes and out of their cars. By establishing bicycle friendly routes all across the Pittsburgh region, bicyclists are able to commute in a safe way. The ways that businesses can promote this healthy way of transportation and life is through providing bicycle racks, showers, and lockers to facilitate in their choice of eliminating emissions through riding a bike. “Free Ride Pittsburgh”, which is a program for people who cannot afford bicycles. They provide volunteers knowledge on how to repair bicycles, so you can earn a free one through the program. There can also be incentives provided by businesses for people who use mass transit or alternative forms of transportations. Rewarding people who carpool with better parking spots, providing bus tickets, or even advocating a “Bike to Work Month”, and distributing local bike routes to get to work. All of these are propositions made by Sustainable Pittsburgh to aid in improving transit and eliminating the negative consequences of transportation. It is done through people individually and businesses collectively.
 
​Next, making buildings more efficient. In the developed world, fully 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions come from heating, cooling, and powering buildings. Many countries have embarked on major efforts to better insulate buildings and install more modern and efficient heating and ventilation equipment. Energy savings could reach 30 percent or more. LEED is the Leadership in Energy and Environment Development. It is a green certification program that recognizes best-in-class building strategies and practices. This is something you can find many Pittsburgh innovative structures taking on as a staple. As I stated above, the David Lawerence Convention center implements many strategist to reduce this carbon dioxide emissions through utilizing natural ventilation and solar energy. Another example would be the new PNC building, which is actually rather fascinating. A majority of it comes down to energy use. The PNC building uses a double-skin façade. The double-skin facade is a system of building consisting of two skins, or facades, placed in such a way that air flows in the intermediate cavity. The ventilation of the cavity can be natural, fan supported or mechanical. When this ventilation is not in use, they implement other energy efficient ways to heat and cool the office, however, this technology is aimed to use 50% less energy than a typical office building. The tower’s roof collects heat from the sun to warm the building, and facilitate natural ventilation. During the summer and spring, the solar chimney pulls air and helps cool down the building. It all aids in not needing to frivolously waste energy and to keep the building at a comfortable temperature.
 
​The building is also structured in such a way to utilize natural daylight. Pittsburgh Earth day states, “Specifically, ninety-two percent of The Tower’s office space receives direct sunlight. To ensure a healthy and productive work environment, The Tower features blinds that prevent glare, help control indoor temperature and ensure that employees have sufficient lighting at their workspace. With the assistance of automated controls, these blinds activate themselves depending on the amount of light entering the building. They automatically close when there is glare or a significant amount of sunlight and open when lighting conditions are ideal” (http://pittsburghearthday.org/pnc/). Much of the building was actually constructed with recycled parts. Approximately 93% of the construction waste went towards the building process, to be exact. Drywall was crushed to be used as lightweight board, and steel was melted and reused. The Near Zero Waste program recycles everything. This ranges from composting organic waste, such as food, to organizing bins for trash, recycling, shred, and compost. This is an aspect as to how local businesses can aid in the urban political economy for the better good: how interrelated the environment, growth of the city, and how building the city is physically formed and the sociological perspectives that it projects. PNC is a clear example of this. The sustainable objective that this infrastructure cultivates is an optimistic view sociologically for the cities inhabitants. It promotes a healthy and green outlook that is encouraged by a business.","2019-08-31 16:10:56","6","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cxx96j/pittsburgh_pa_a_case_study_pt5/","True","toolatetobeoriginal","1747982886.655678","green energy transition","manual"
"cxousz","sustainability","action-oriented","Pittsburgh,PA: A Case Study Pt 4","Pittsburgh, just like every other United State’s city, has characteristics from a “built environment”. This is another theoretical approach to explaining the demands for a sustainable city, or eco-city in the North Western Pennsylvania region. The demand for urban change in the city comes from the demands of the citizens, and is responded to, or not responded to by the private sectors or local governments. Kleniwski argues, “The human-environment interaction is reciprocal: people build cities to fulfill certain purposes, and once the cities are built, they influence how people live in them (11)”. Mass transit, new eco-friendly buildings, preservation of historical territories, upgrading power infrastructure, and boosting clean energy are all very critical when manifesting and cultivating a transition from a once heavily polluted area, into an up and coming sustainable space. A more specific example of this would be “The David L. Lawrence Convention Center is a significant symbol of the ""new"" Pittsburgh Region. As Pittsburgh continues to revolutionize into a regional destination place, this landmark building has become the cornerstone of the transformation (visitpittsburgh.com).” The convention center, located in Pittsburgh’s historical strip district is the world’s first “green” convention center, as well as the world’s largest “green” building. The David L. Lawrence Convention Center uses a reclamation water system that aids in reducing potable water usage, as well as, the building utilizes natural ventilation and daylight to cool and heat the building. The transition into a post-industrial society, which Pittsburgh has progressed into is a direct communication and correlation between the cities residents and private sectors developments. Kleniewski states, “A city’s built environment is a reflection of its social structure (12)”. This is highlighted and demonstrated through the changes in political and economic realm of Pittsburgh. As the city turns into a very technological and medical dominated area, the people who come to fulfill those jobs represent a more affluent and educated background. This sociological development of the cities urban residents pushes for better surroundings, and in turn, is reflected by the green establishments and changes the cities have produced to “work with nature”. This recent change represented the post-industrial outlook, and hopes to encompass all rights for equality.

​Going back to the holistic theoretical approach of what urban cities can do to implement a progressive change; one must review how to make our cities more livable and sustainable, and analyze if our case study, Pittsburgh, is following suit in these actions. The political urban economy of a city is the driving force behind making these crucial developments. General changes that can be implemented into making Pittsburgh into a more sustainable city involve: improving mass transit, making buildings more efficient, preservation of historical and natural assests, and upgrading power infrastructure.
 
​Improving mass transit is a necessity for sustainable cities, and something that Pittsburgh has been moving towards. Cities in the United States, such as Pittsburgh are designed in a grid-lock fashion. This grid-lock, or block to block road ways allows for the congregation of automobiles and for heavy waves of emissions and pollution to occur.","2019-08-30 23:47:06","2","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cxousz/pittsburghpa_a_case_study_pt_4/","True","toolatetobeoriginal","1747982888.934685","green energy transition","manual"
