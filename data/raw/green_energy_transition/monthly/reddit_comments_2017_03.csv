"deww68u","t3_5zbnj5","5zbnj5","science","scientific","Hello! 
I'm 5 months away from defending my dissertation and the only thing I know about post-grad is: I want out of academic science. I am, at best, an adequate bench researcher. I'm a good writer, a good communicator, and I'd like to use those skills to advocate for science, science-supported policy and being ""the scientist in the room"" sounds like my ideal job.

The issue is this: other than the fellowship you're in and others like it, ""science policy"" isn't a job description that I see. 

1) How do I get your job? Meaning, how did you get yours?
2) Are there words I should look for that code for ""policy and outreach"" in job descriptions?
3) Do you anticipate your job being more difficult int he current political climate, or do you see your peers struggling? Thoughts on where we're headed and what we on the scientific community can do?
Thanks so much for taking time with us today!

I'm another scientist who went down an 'alternative' career path (tech transfer, then radiation protection which is not lab based at all, and soon moving into project management for a tech spin out). I felt one major problem with University was - at least in my experience for physics - that you are geared towards going on to do a PhD and move into academia by default, even if this is not something that you wanted to do. I was offered little support and guidance regarding non-traditional scientific career paths, and I now periodically return to my university to give such advice to current undergrads and postgrads.

Do you feel that scientific departments are quite close minded to alternative careers that aren't necessarily academic? What do you think that departments and careers staff can do to highlight scientific careers that aren't seen as ""traditional""?","2017-03-14 13:27:55","9","OldBoltonian","1747951068.693414","green energy transition","manual"

I'm hoping to transition out of academia into the policy realm. I have a couple of questions about what kind of experience I can get to make sure this is what I want to do and get my feet wet.
1. What kind of policy experience did you have before you started?
2. What are the differences in culture that you see between academia and policy work? Do you have to wear a suit? 
3. I am currently volunteering with a science advocacy organization- will that be something that can go on my resumé for policy?
4. Are there advocacy actions I can take that will be harmful to working in policy, i.e., Is it ok if I volunteer with Indivisible or a local party organization? Would that be helpful?

I'm a neuropharmacolgy graduate student, and thanks to zero funding, I won't be able to continue my PhD, and  frankly, I'm not willing too move to a new lab because A) I'm in the only neuropharm lab on campus, B) I'm not willing to start over on a topic I don't really care about, and C) I'm just kinda burned out.

Please help me find a way to move forward and make a difference so other people are never in my position.
