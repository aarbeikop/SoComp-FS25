"39yuyn","climate","scientific","Let's do Paris before the COPS arrive","I propose that we crowd source a climate change agreement on reddit rather than leaving it to a bunch of stodgy old bureaucrats later this year. Anything and everything should be on the table to start. I'll propose some categories and make a proposal to get the ball rolling.

**Types of Emissions:** There are several kinds of emissions: Historical, future, per capita, and consumption versus production to name a few. I won't insult readers of r/climate by defining them here but at some point precise definitions might become necessary. For example consumption emissions might be defined as:

total emissions - exported emissions + imported emissions

It's also possible to combine categories, for example per capita historical emissions could conceivably be important to somebody.

**Budget:** I assume (and I won't say this again but nothing I say here is meant to be etched in stone) each country will be left with a future carbon budget after the negotiations are complete. The first order of business would seem to be an overall budget, which can then be divvied up between countries. Does anyone still think a 2C target is reachable based on IPCC numbers? 

The 1000 gigatons (Gt) of total carbon emissions number gets thrown out a lot as giving us some chance of a 2C target maximum temperature rise. That may not include carbon equivalents for stuff like NO2 and multipliers on methane and CFCs, but it's a round number, which is nice. We might have to agree to some reforestation or afforestation if we start with that number. 

We've already emitted about 550 Gt so we're left with about 450 Gt under that scenario. That also equates to about 1650 CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). Take away the 150 Gt CO2e due to be released as methane and we're once again left with a round 1500 Gt CO2 equivalents.

[Others might argue that's too generous by half](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/10/carbon-briefing-making-sense-of-the-ipcc%E2%80%99s-new-carbon-budget/), and I look forward to input on the matter. In my opinion choosing numbers that are unrealistically low does not serve us well in the long run.

**Other types of mitigation:** I mentioned growing trees. Is it wise to include some expectation of CCS by other means? It seems like we might get there for point-of-release emissions although on what scale I do not know and am dubious.

**Accountability:** One of the shameful legacies of the Copenhagen accords brought about by a few bad actors was the idea that compliance should be voluntary. It seems to me that we're going to have to have some sort of international monitoring and even fines, perhaps to be paid into:

**International Green Climate Fund:** Or whatever it's called to help developing countries develop renewable energy (and nuclear?). I think the amount paid into this fund should be heavily related to historical emissions. This could also be funded by a worldwide carbon tax, which would put the onus on future emitters. Perhaps a combination?

**My proposal:** In terms of future carbon budgets, how about if we neglect historical emissions and even consumption emissions and just base each country's budget on equal per capita emissions? 

Going forward, every man, woman, and child is allowed the same amount of emissions.

At first blush this may seem like a raw deal for developing countries that are not responsible for historical emissions. However, when you start looking at the numbers it seems like the best they can hope for. According to the numbers above and my error-prone calculations, that's about 200 tons of CO2e emissions per person from now until eternity. Countries can decide for themselves how that's spread between individuals and future generations as seems inevitable regardless of how the budgets are allocated.

[You can get a rough idea of how long a budget would last in a given country by dividing 200 by these numbers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita) 

Obviously it's going to be most difficult for countries with the highest per capita emissions such as Australia, The USA, and Canada. It's about 8 years of emissions for these countries at current rates, more if they start cutting back. Under a cap and trade system they could conceivably buy carbon credits from developing countries or perhaps build solar installations in these countries in exchange for carbon credits.

China would have about 30 years of emissions at current rates, but given current trends would have to peak or at least seriously level off before their announced 2030 target. European countries, Japan and others would fall in between these two. 

At current rates, third world countries would have until the end of the century and beyond to give up fossil fuels but would also have plenty of room to increase consumption in the short term and then transition to renewables.","2015-06-15 22:17:25","1","0","0.54","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/39yuyn/lets_do_paris_before_the_cops_arrive/","True","knowyourbrain","1747909282.5591831","green energy transition","manual"

► In just 13 years, we will “lock in” an inevitable near term 6°C earth temp rise because we continually exceed the worse-case emissions scenario set out back in 2007 says climate scientist, Dr. Michael Jennings.

► Energy demand will increase 100% by 2060 because the population of the world's cities will go up by 2.5 billion people by then. That's like building 290 cities the size of London (pop: 8 million) in 35 years. Check out the following 6°C scenario for energy use.

► We mined 50% of all the copper in human history in just the last 30 years.

► 100% green energy requires 500% more copper.

► Peak minerals includes more than just copper.

► By 2050, expect to be past peaks for tin, silver, nickel, cadmium and more.

► We move some 3 billion tons of earth per year to get 15 millions tons of copper.

► We can’t afford to mine 500% more copper at ever lower concentrations.

► We cannot recycle it into existence.

► Recycling green energy alloys uses more energy than mining for lower quality results.

► We cannot conserve it into existence.

► Substituting aluminum for copper takes 5X the energy and is less safe.

► Manufacturing just five, 1-megawatt, wind turbines produces 1 ton of radioactive residue and 75 tons of toxic, acidic water used to leach out the required neodymium.

► Our “green” energy hi-tech future requires the following: conflict minerals, rare earth elements, heavy metals, nano metals and graphite. Search for “rare earth mining in China” on YouTube and see what special hell your solar panels and wind turbines produce in Mongolia. China can do this because they have undercut all the world’s production of Rare Earth Elements (REEs) with low wages, low currency and no environmental enforcement.

► New study on bat deaths due to turbines.

One company in the U.S. cut down 5 acres of trees to build a solar farm to power a plant for the production of plastic bags. Green plastic bags -- fucking mind blowing. Green power will not be enough. Part-time energy and billions of tons of toxic lead, liquid metal or molten salt batteries adds up to death to all life on earth just from sheer destructive ecological inertia due to mineral extraction. 

Tim Garrett explains why 

► we can’t decouple growth from emissions. 

► efficiency & conservation only leads to more energy growth.

So far, we have to replace fossil fuels with 10X its rated power, while emissions have to drop 80% while total energy demand doubles in the midst of energy, mineral, food and water shortages. Please don't be offended if I tell you this is fuckn impossible. You can't use solar panels to make 10X as much green energy without accelerating peak minerals, ecological destruction, water mismanagement etc.
