I’m Wilson Smith, an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, studying solar energy. My team researches various ways to convert solar energy into electricity and chemical fuels using only water and CO2 as the raw materials.  These processes try to replicate what nature has done for over a billion years in photosynthesis, and thus this process is sometimes called ‘artificial photosynthesis’.  However, plants have generally very low efficiencies (~1%), so we try to find ways to beat nature using only cheap and abundant materials.  Recently, [we were able to achieve an efficiency of 12.7%](http://phys.org/news/2016-07-simple-solution-hydrogen-production-solar.html), but still have our work cut out for us.  Our ultimate goal is to design systems and devices that can help contribute to the global transition to a renewable energy society that is sustainable and clean.

You can catch up with our work on our group website (www.smithsolarlab.com), or follow our updates on twitter (@smithsolarlab).
Outside of r/Science, I’ve been known to lurk in r/Phish and r/ASOIAF, and went to high school with Jean-Ralphio from Parks and Rec.
I’ll be here as long as it takes to answer your questions about solar fuels, sustainable energy technologies, and what its like to set up a research lab (and life) in Europe as an American.  Lets get this going reddit, ask me anything!

**I’ll be back at 1 pm EST (10 am PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!**","2016-09-29 10:19:47","644","80","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/551i6h/science_ama_series_hi_reddit_im_wilson_smith_an/","True","Dr_Wilson_Smith","1747944848.248796","green energy transition","manual"
"53mv68","science","scientific","American Chemical Society AMA: We are Keira Havens & Rafa Gomez Bombarelli here to talk about the Launch Smarter Chemistry Challenge. Ask us anything about building an ecosystem for better innovation in chemistry.","Hi Reddit! 

I am Keira Havens  - you’ve seen [me here on Reddit before](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2yktjz/we_are_making_color_changing_flowers_using/) when I shared my color changing flower project a few years ago. I’m a molecular biologist by training and focused on synthetic biology while in academia. I went on to start a company around the [color changing flower concept](http://www.popsci.com/keira-havens-has-gone-nuclear-missileer-plant-engineer) and learned a lot about the way a new application makes it into the marketplace - or doesn’t.  That experience got me thinking closely about the systems we use to identify beneficial technologies and eventually brought me to LAUNCH, to build networks that connect technology more closely with society.

And I am Rafael “Rafa” Gomez Bombarelli: Postdoctoral Fellow, Harvard University. I currently work at the [Aspuru-Guzik group](http://aspuru.chem.harvard.edu/) in the computer driven design of molecular materials. I combine machine learning and first principles simulation to rapidly discover practical materials: organic light emitting diodes for displays, electrolytes for flow batteries, and organic photovoltaics for solar cells. I have a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.

We’re here to answer your questions.  In particular, we’re excited to talk about the [LAUNCH Smarter Chemistry Challenge](http://www.launch.org/challenges/smarter-chemistry), developed in partnership with the [ACS Green Chemistry Institute](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry.html), and other organizations. The challenge is a global call for innovators and entrepreneurs, companies, and organizations, to enable predictive chemical design through innovative applications of data.  Why data? Predictive design can’t exist without good information. This requires the right data to exist, that the data is publicly accessible, and that the data is in a consistent format that can be easily used by scientists, companies and institutions. By any of these measures, chemistry faces enormous challenges. Check out the challenge [here](http://www.launch.org/challenges/smarter-chemistry), and ask us anything about the challenge, data in chemistry, computer driven design, and the process of technological innovation, from discovery to adoption!
