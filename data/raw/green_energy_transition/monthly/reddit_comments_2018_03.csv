Green energy is a great way to help though. ","2018-03-03 06:32:07","1","cas1313","1747963650.2062342","green energy transition","manual"
"dwbnvfy","t3_87b8b7","87b8b7","sustainability","action-oriented","The first R is always ""refuse"" - the point of zero waste/low impact is to just not use stuff. Instead of metal or even compostable straws, just don't use a straw. This can be applied to a ton of things, so it's up to each person to determine what things they can kick out of their life while still taking care of themselves.

For things you do need, buy used. In this way, reusables are good because they have life past the original user.

Also, reusable items can be made from recycled materials. They aren't currently, but materials science could also help with that.

Composting is a great option, especially considering that eventually they will return to the earth (as opposed to things like plastic or metal that we can't ""put back""). The issue, however, is that it still takes a lot of energy/resources to MAKE that thing, to get back that thing, to sort what we get back, and then to produce the next material. I could use 4 compostable forks a week, or use ONE metal fork. Over a period of time, the reusable item would win out for the compostable item. If a reusable item won't make it to that time where it wins out, compostable would be the way.","2018-03-26 19:24:01","14","[deleted]","1747964597.224679","green energy transition","manual"
"dwbxk99","t3_87b8b7","87b8b7","sustainability","action-oriented","Agreed. There are products out there that are cost-effective. I work in the culinary industry (former restaurant and bar owner now in event biz) and recommend a product line that replaces straws, plastic utensils, cups and plates with bio-based alternatives from palm leaves and sugarcane bagasse. Not sure if it's ok to name the brand on this sub but I'm doing it -- Natural Tableware. Really good-looking stuff.
