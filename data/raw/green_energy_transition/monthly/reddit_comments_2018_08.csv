"e4one0c","t3_997qyy","997qyy","climatechange","action-oriented","I have kids your age and I'm not very much concerned, neither about my personal future, nor about theirs.  It's quite normal to feel insecure at fifteen.  Can still remember the time.  So many world issues that you didn't think of just some years ago.  And so many opinions about them.  I recall seeing charts in school showing the nearing end of civilization due to exponential population growth, with a menacing hockey-stick curve.  That was decades ago. Yet here we are...

There's a lot of fearmongering around.  The ""near-term human extinction"" crowd being the worst, depicting the end of the civilisation in the next couple of years.  I don't believe any of this is credible or good science. 

If you are living in a part of the world where you have access to your own computer and education, changes are that you're living in a part that's likely to be less affected by climate change. 

What's likely to become a concern even in your generation is sea-level rise, so I wouldn't buy or build a beach-front property.  But even this is unfolding over decades, centuries, and even millenia.   Some aspects may get more challenging over time, frequently mentioned are hotter summers, more drought, increased extinction of  species, more violent rain and hurricanes.  But this won't change the earth into a post-apocalyptic wasteland and most likely, you will be able to live a normal life. And your kids too, should you want to have some.

In the eighties we worried about the Soviets overrunning the West and\or raining nuclear weapons upon our heads. Kids were taught how to hide under their desks and close their eyes in the advent of a nuclear strike. When I was ten, we received pamphlets telling us that, if a nuclear war seemed imminent, we were to paint our houses white, block up the windows and have the bathtub and every bottle and bucket we could find filled with enough water to last us two weeks - after which we would likely starve to death. Nuclear winter. Acid rain. Ozone failure. Biological and chemical weapons. Shit looked very bleak. It looked like the end of the world.

Then, in a matter of weeks, our context changed. The Baltic states erupted into protest, the Soviet Union blinked, various talking heads threatened immediate and devastating retaliation... And then we saw the Berlin wall crumble, the attempted coup against the Russian President, the old guard being swept away. The world had ended, but only for the Soviets.

The recent news articles about ""Hothouse Earth"", etc, is somewhat overblown. The paper itself outlined a number of areas we need to investigate to understand tipping points, and laid out an possible paths toward halting global warming. Halting it in your lifetime. To do this requires action, it requires mobilization, it requires inter-generational thinking and it requires political will.

Right now, in some parts of the West, we are lagging behind on political will, but there is a feeling of change in the air. More people are demanding action than ever before. The anti-climate-change brigade look very strong standing hand-in-hand in the halls of power, yelling and screaming and demanding we all turn back the tide. But, in truth, they are clinging to one another, and are yelling and screaming because otherwise they won't be heard above the ocean of public opinion that is rising to sweep them away. The halls of power are always the last place over which social change sweeps, but it often strikes there hardest. They are angry and loud because their worst fears are coming true. Their world is ending. 

The rest of us will roll up our sleeves and get on with things.","2018-08-22 00:46:25","5","monkeydrunker","1747969283.1523252","green energy transition","manual"

"e4ms1mg","t3_997qyy","997qyy","climatechange","action-oriented","The incredible bad news about climate change is necessary, the world needed to know and the world needed to do something. But no one cared, we continued pumping CO2 into the air, warming the earth more and more, eventually damaging it.

But then the bad news spreaded more and more, untill there was finally some action. The world now speaks about it, everyone knows about it. Look at the results:

1) Paris Agreement, to limit the rising temprature only to 1.5C, maximum 2C. All countries in the world have signed it (except USA and 3 others, but the USA is kind of still in the deal and is making changes anyway, so they are sort of in the deal).

2) NASA is in it aswell, which is big! They are building so many new tech to be able to monitor the earth and to strike the tipping points (places where it gets very hot or very cold) in order to solve the problems there. With the new satellites comes new data, comes new calculations, comes new algorithms with NEW SOLUTIONS! [Check here!](https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/missions/?page=0&per_page=40&order=title+asc&search=)

While the Paris Agreement is already the solution, NASA refuses to keep it at that and continues finding other solutions aswell. Currently they are researching on how to use cryogenics technology to cool certain places in the earth or keep the north pole/south pole colder when temperature rise. 

There are even back up plans being created in case needed. They seem to be a little over the top, but they are there non the less. [Check this link about a mirror in space, to send the sunlight \(warms the earth\) back to space to cool the earth more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_mirror_\(climate_engineering\))

3) People all around the world are now aware of climate change, and everyone wants to do something about it. In the past, humanity didn't care for our mother earth. We dumped garbage into the sea/oceans, we didn't care AT ALL about emmissions pumped into the air and we didn't care about chemicals to be dumped into rivers and such. Now times are changing and people are doing their best to take care of our mother earth. No more garbage in beaches, no more chemical spills in oceans and nature and there are regions that are being [""PROTECTED FROM HUMANS""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Specially_Protected_Area) to keep animals/species safe from extinction.

4) Cities all around the world are preparing for floods. Tunnels around the world are being build, new systems to pump water back into the ocean or even bigger barries like in the Netherlands are made to keep the water at bay. [Check this link on what the Netherlands has done so far, which with that tech, they could implement it to other countries in the world if needed.](http://www.euronews.com/2017/11/16/dutch-show-the-way-to-deal-with-rising-sea-levels)

We are also starting to recycle a lot. In the Netherlands, there are 4 bins: Blue, Orange, Green and Black. Blue is for paper, orange is for plastic, green is for plants/foods and black is the rest. We never saw this huge recycle thing happening in the past, now the government here is doing something about it. Everyone is now ACTIVE in recycling which is only GREAT for our enviorment and for the future of the planet.

The only thing we will have to deal with in the future, things that will happen in our lifetime, is that the earth gets a bit warmer (with the Paris Agreement, 1,5C, but if not possible, it's 2C), and when it rains, it will rain longer and more. Those are kind of the major things you will have to accept. Ofcourse there is more happening such as certain species dying or more coral gone from the oceans, but the world is being protected, and there are areas very closely watched to make sure nothing goes wrong. 

If we come to the conclusion, are we officially doomed?
- NO! We are making progress. The whole world has a new goal now, protecting mother earth. This common goal will cause the world to work more together which in return increases relationship between countries and therefore lower the chances of the old scary problem in the past: Wars. Besides having already a solution (Paris Agreement), there are still other teams of scientists making more solutions ON TOP of the solution we already have.

I say: have faith in humanity. We have come so far with technology. We have created computers, Artificial Intelligence, medicine, cars, trains, planes, boats, etc. We have even landed on the freaking moon! We even live in the time where plans are being made to colonize other planets such as Mars.

It all basically comes down to this tweet: https://twitter.com/AlexSteffen/status/943940259896684545

There is hope! The world is NOT and WILL NOT stop progress!

The assholes who have no problem making kids afraid know very well that you don't yet have enough scientific understanding to know when you are being lied to. 

In answer to your last question, I am afraid the only real solution I know is to look at all the past prophecies of doom and ask yourself whether they turned out to be correct. When I explored that myself, I found all sorts of ridiculous alarmism that intelligent people actually believed at the time. Once you realize that humans have an ingrained bias toward believing bad news (which was very handy in keeping us alive during our hunter/gatherer phase, by the way), you'll have a broad enough perspective to quiet your fears.","2018-08-22 03:56:01","4","Will_Power","1747969283.163945","green energy transition","manual"

Let's just say that I've tried too many hobbies and none so far is as rewarding as ""growing plants"".  Not only can it be as addicting as any hobby, it's also very healthy plus considerable potential to be a money-maker.  Plus, it's a survival thing and can be upgraded with gadgets and gizmos.  Dabbling in hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics can be very dangerous to the wallet.","2018-08-22 03:02:32","2","hopeitwillgetbetter","1747969283.165998","green energy transition","manual"

"e4nzgir","t3_997qyy","997qyy","climatechange","action-oriented","Fearmongering and extinction aside, the arctic will melt, methane will release. Habitat destruction will continue. Species extinction will increase. Acidification of the ocean will continue. Sea level will rise, and render much low farming land too salty to grow anything. Many coastal cities will be abandoned. The jet stream will meander more than it is, causing slow moving systems of warm air moving up, and cold moving down into the mid latitudes, resulting in large crop failures, starvation, huge fires, drought, flooding, blizzards etc. 
There will be unprecedented migrations of people, political turmoil, economic crises. 
There will not be 7 - 12 billion people by next century, and even with decisive action, it will be awful. 
Does one bring children into this? I'd say do your research and make decisions with eyes wide open.
