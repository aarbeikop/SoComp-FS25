I’m [Vasanti Malik](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/6308), a research scientist in the [Department of Nutrition](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition/) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Global Nutrition and Epidemiologic Transition Initiative at Harvard. My research focuses on evaluating dietary risk factors for obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease with an emphasis on diet quality. More recent research interests include studying nutritional drivers of the global obesity and diabetes epidemics in countries undergoing epidemiologic transition.

In January, U.S. officials [released a new set of Dietary Guidelines](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/assessing-the-new-u-s-dietary-guidelines/)—broad advice on how the nation should eat. These new Guidelines included some significant changes from previous versions, including the recommendation no more than 10% of a person’s daily calories come from added sugars. This is the first time the Guidelines set an upper limit for added sugar intake. Another important change is the removal of an upper limit for total dietary fat, and a greater emphasis on consuming certain types of fat.

But there were also some omissions, which have [drawn criticism from nutrition scientists](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2016/01/07/new-dietary-guidelines-remove-restriction-on-total-fat-and-set-limit-for-added-sugars-but-censor-conclusions/). The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee—a group of scientists who made recommendations about what should be included in the Guidelines—called for specific guidance regarding reduced consumption of red meat and sugar-sweetened beverages. These were not included.

Overall, these Guidelines do represent an important step towards helping Americans identify healthy dietary patterns.

I’ll be here from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. EST to answer your questions about the Dietary Guidelines and nutrition; Ask Me Anything!

"4bc6tp","collapse","skeptical","Simulating Collapse in Fate of the World","There's a game out there that's called Fate of the World. It never did very well, the company went bankrupt. The problem it seems to have is that it's too dark to serve as an educational game and too complicated to serve as mere entertainment.

I've played around with it for a bit and want to share some conclusions I drew from it:

-It's impossible to keep global emissions below the level needed to stay beneath two degree Celsius. You're a skilled player if you can stay beneath 2.5 degree Celsius without triggering a complete collapse of global civilization, complete with nuclear warfare and billions of deaths.

-The most important places to protect are Europe and North America, with Oceania, Japan and Russia relevant to a lesser degree. These are places where scientific research is done to come up with technologies to decarbonize the economy. It's possible to develop other regions (South America for example) but this is probably not in your advantage, because these regions will rely on dirty energy, while Europe, North America and Japan have already started the path towards a clean economy. South America is only relevant insofar as you manage to prevent deforestation there, as excessive deforestation seems to trigger a tipping point, that causes you to gradually lose the entire Amazon rainforest and all of its sequestered carbon.

-Some places are developing and their economic development is really a big problem for you, rather than a solution. China and India's economies rely almost entirely on dirty coal. China's development has to be restrained, while India's development has to be sabotaged if anything. It's really in your best interest to prevent the third world from developing in the first place. This limits deforestation too.

-It's practically impossible to survive without provoking a collapse. The trick here is to engineer an artificial collapse, without letting the collapse run out of control. My solution to this is to first make an effort to phase out coal in the important regions (ie the developed world). I then implement a global ban on coal for five years. This triggers an economic collapse. Economic collapse happens in the game when the size of the financial sector is more than twice as big as agriculture and industry combined, ie people are endlessly trading paper assets back and forth with each other without anyone producing anything that's genuinely of any value. I then remove the ban on coal five years later, allowing the global economy to continue its natural path towards exponential growth, but from a much lower baseline. 

-Why is it so important to collapse on purpose? You need to buy yourself time, before your new technologies are ready that are supposed to solve your problems. It's much preferable to burn a piece of coal in 2050, when your carbon capture and sequestration technology has been implemented, than to burn the coal in 2020, when it just straight up enters the atmosphere. In addition, spreading emissions out allow you to compensate a bit through use of biochar. Most importantly however, you want to avoid rising above 2.5 degree Celsius before you're ready to implement geoengineering in multiple continents. This means spraying aerosols into the atmosphere to keep temperatures relatively low.

-One other problem that can be addressed through an intentional collapse is to reduce your oil consumption. If you don't take effective measures to prevent it, an oil shortage is the first fossil fuel shortage you'll run into. This should typically buy you time until you can develop more efficient biofuels. Electrical cars can help you, as can infrastructure development in the third world. The problem is that an oil shortage than runs out of control translates into a food shortage. This can be addressed by transitioning to organic agriculture, which uses far less oil, but the problem is that this temporarily reduces regional yields, potentially triggering famines or an economic crisis as a result of the agricultural sector rapidly shrinking. By the time you realize why it's wise to move towards organic agriculture, it's typically too late to do so without a massive disruption.

-Oceania is flooded with refugees, if you don't stop them. This triggers the collapse of Oceania, which seems to unfold in the form of a positive feedback loop of massive unemployment triggering even more unemployment, until people eventually simply end up dying of hunger and war breaks out (I presume between natives and refugees).

-Japan is very prone to have famines, because it relies mostly on food imports. It's surprisingly difficult to prevent Japan's collapse.

-It can ironically be best to keep people rather right-wing and chauvinistic. Green politics cause people to reject geoengineering, which means that you have no way to stop the positive feedback loops of Arctic methane and forest fires that cause temperatures to further spiral out of control. It's also an advantage to have a xenophobic population that wants refugees to be shot on sight when trying to cross the border. Refugees after all, are not productive members of society until they are integrated into society.

-Perhaps most important: You can't really survive the 22nd century without science-fiction technologies. You can use geo-engineering to keep temperatures low, but eventually your intervention in the atmosphere becomes so large that you get big droughts and other problems. It's possible to nearly completely decarbonize Western economies, but it takes time and money to introduce such technologies in third world countries, which will emit carbon in the meantime. It might be possible to get emissions down by 80%, but that merely buys you some time, eventually you run into the same problems that you would run into otherwise. The game however introduces a significant and effective source of negative carbon emissions by then, in the form of artificial trees that suck CO2 out of the atmosphere. It also introduces nuclear fusion, in addition to some stuff I won't spoil yet. I'll leave it up to you to decide how realistic all of that is.

###Interesting sidenote

Players of the game were upset, because it's not really easy to win and you generally have billions of deaths, even if you do quite well. What did they do? *They made a mod that removes the worst positive feedback effects of climate change!* Isn't that hilarious? That's pretty much what the IPCC did too, removing the positive feedback effects of climate change because it's too difficult to address our problems otherwise as nature begins to emit greenhouse gasses too. It seems that when people are faced with all the facts, they respond in the same manner, by selectively ignoring the worst facts, regardless of whether they're scientists and policymakers or regular gamers.","2016-03-21 13:12:33","372","80","0.98","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/4bc6tp/simulating_collapse_in_fate_of_the_world/","True","adminscantbanme","1747938333.4008698","green energy transition","manual"
