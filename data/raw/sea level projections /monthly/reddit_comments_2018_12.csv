"ecotfjz","t3_aa2reh","aa2reh","sustainability","action-oriented","I think to start with the basics like increased CO2 in the air causes more heat to be trapped and raises temps is great.  My personal opinion is because there is so much people hear in the media this key point often gets lost.  Having a grounded start of what's the problem and here's the implied path to a solution probably goes without saying, but it seems to not get said a lot.","2018-12-27 22:40:47","4","EndCarbonPollution","1747878838.6127822","sea level projections","manual"

One thing I would like to add is to stress on ecological footprint in your blog or channel and try to quantify all measures through that instead of carbon footprint. Ecological footprint is more contextual and comprehensive. And there is a online calculator by global footprint network. I am trying that approach for our non profit work in Edmonton.","2018-12-28 01:15:03","3","zenneutral","1747878838.6284387","sea level projections","manual"

"ecqy62y","t3_aa2reh","aa2reh","sustainability","action-oriented","I work as a consulting CMO for Geoplast, company dedicated to improving sustainability in the construction industry.

tructural sustainability is an often neglected issue. 

For example:
https://www.geoplastglobal.com/en/insights/how-airplast-made-edf-lab-paris-saclay-more-sustainable/

Concrete increases CO2 not only by production but transport. There are many products that reduce its use and it can be recycled. So when buying a house it would be good to ask for more sustainable structural engineering.

Feel free to email me for more at nikola@bemapps.com. Also send me your blog when on.

"ecm25r7","t3_a9p0jt","a9p0jt","sustainability","action-oriented","Why do you introduce the idea of the Environmental Kuznets curve if it is incorrect? the paper you link itself asserts that there are fundamental problems with this idea, so why do you bring it up? there is alot of literature out there that refutes the existence of an EKC, so bringing it up in the manner in which you did leads the reader to incorrectly assume that it does indeed exist. 

Also, the paper you linked is unfortunately behind a paywall (FUCK Elsevier) so there is no way for many people to follow your sources.

Here is a link to a paper that is easily accessible which refutes the EKC https://steadystate.org/wp-content/uploads/Stern_KuznetsCurve.pdf

""The evidence presented in this paper shows that the statistical analysis on which the environmental Kuznets curve is based is not robust. There is little evidence for a common inverted U-shaped pathway that countries follow as their income rises"" (pg.1435)
""‘Our review of both the theoretical and empirical work on the EKC leads us to be skeptical about the existence of a simple and predictable relationship between pollution and per capita income"" (pg.1435)

So please, do not bring the EKC into this as it is (at least very arguably) fundamentally untrue
