There are a lot of different directions you can take with sustainability in the built environment. When you say green architecture or design do you mean making a building more environmentally friendly? There are a ton of ways you can do this and a position for anything you can think of. You can have expertise in lighting design, building envelopes, green roofs, exterior landscaping, green materials, energy efficiency, etc, etc.

I mostly take project teams through a green building certification. LEED, NGBS, Energy Star, Passive House, etc. I need to know a little bit about a lot, but don't necessarily know everything about proper daylighting or the perfect building envelope.

I would say one easier way to start might be to get an accreditation related to one type of green building certification. Something like a [LEED Green Associate](http://www.usgbc.org/articles/interested-becoming-leed-green-associate-or-leed-ap-what-you-need-know) is a training that allows you to know the basics of LEED certification. Architects, engineers, builders and other designers all need people to take them through the certification process and tell them which direction to take the design.

If you have any other questions I'd really be happy to talk to you about it. I've been working in the green building industry for about 7 years. I have 5 different certifications related to building science and green building. It's definitely growing with more certifications every year. PM me with other questions.","2017-01-24 04:08:03","8","Jumpin_Joeronimo","1747857763.2445867","sea level projections","manual"

"dctrxjg","t3_5pt6b9","5pt6b9","sustainability","action-oriented","Since you have an economics/math background, it may good to work your way into the Utility Tracking field. Check out companies like Wegowise, or the ENERGY STAR Portfolio. 

I'm sure there are plenty of grad programs or fellowship programs related to this field that may be more approachable for you than a full time job. In fact, I know of one in particular if you have a Master's Degree. http://edfclimatecorps.org/

Best of luck to you. ","2017-01-24 03:20:01","1","[deleted]","1747857763.2445867","sea level projections","manual"
