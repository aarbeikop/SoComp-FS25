We fly through clouds and break waves in the lab to study how aerosols impact our clouds, weather, and climate. AMA!","Hi Reddit-I am a Professor of Chemistry at UC San Diego. I hold a joint appointment in the Dept. of Chemistry and Biochemistry and also Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I have spent over 20 years studying the impact of atmospheric aerosols on air pollution, human health, and climate. Aerosols are solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere, which range from soot emitted from cars and wildfires to natural sources such as dust and sea spray.  Because of their extreme complexity, our overall understanding of how much they are affecting climate through interactions with clouds represents the single largest uncertainty in our overall understanding of climate change. Over the past two decades, my research group has performed field studies around the world on ships, aircraft, and in mobile laboratories aimed at determining the major sources of atmospheric aerosols.  Most recently, by performing unique aircraft measurements inside clouds, we have directly determined which particles seed clouds and how different sources can affect precipitation.  Surprisingly, we discovered that dust from as far away as Africa and microbes picked up over the oceans can affect the amount of snowfall over the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.  Yes, indeed aerosols from one continent can influence weather over another thousands of miles away!

I serve as the Director of an NSF Center for Chemical Innovation called the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment (http://caice.ucsd.edu, @CAICECCI). In CAICE, we transferred the complexity of the real world into a laboratory setting to perform controlled chemistry experiments that can be used to explain atmospheric observations. The Center brings together chemists with marine biologists and oceanographers to perform studies in a unique ocean-atmosphere facility which uses real seawater, breaking waves, and biology to control the composition of seawater and sea spray.  Using this new approach, we are rapidly learning new things about the ocean-atmosphere system. See a recent video posted on our most recent publication:
 
Prather, et al. (2013), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, “Bringing the ocean into the laboratory to probe the chemical complexity of sea spray aerosol”. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBX4Vl6-SMM))
 
So feel free to ask me anything about aerosols, clouds, aircraft studies, our wave machine, CAICE, atmospheric microbes, and chemistry. Also, happy to discuss steps we can take to help our planet and my thoughts on the importance of communicating our exciting science findings to the public. Finally, I am open to discussing my own career path to becoming an atmospheric chemistry professor.

I will be back at 1 pm ET to answer your questions. AMA!

EDIT I am here and ready to start answering questions. Very exciting to see so much interest in this topic. 

I am here at UC San Diego with a number of my students, CAICE faculty, and members of our research team--Dr. Doug Collins (CAICE managing director), Prof. Bob Continetti, Prof. Francesco Paesani, Jackie Dowling (undergrad visiting from Carleton College), Robin Richardson (UCSD undergrad), Kathryn Nadler (UCSD grad student), and Nicole Campbell (UCSD grad student)....We are going to start answering questions now.

I noticed there are a number of questions about cloud seeding so I will just answer broadly up here to start.  Many people are asking if we should /start/ cloud seeding but we already are doing so in many places in the world, including California since the late 1940's.  Little known fact.  We seed clouds in California due to our interest in hydroelectric power. The mechanism for enhancement is still not fully resolved and sometimes it appears to work, and other times it does not.  The question we are asking in our studies is how are the aerosol seeds produced by humans (aka pollution) affecting our rain and snowfall?  The idea is if you put too many (aerosol) seeds into a cloud, you make many tiny droplets that cannot grow big enough to fall--thus you can turn off precipitation in some regions with high levels of pollution.  When we went to study this in a region over our major watershed, we found a surprise--that Mother Nature was seeding clouds using aerosols transported from far away (Africa!) produced by natural sources, including dust and microbes. Nature appears to have figured out the perfect cloud seeding recipe which turns out to be quite different from the ones humans use.  Dust and microbes make ice in clouds at higher altitudes which grow and then fall and scavenge drops along the way leading to copious snowfall at the ground!  So...now I will go down thru the questions and answer those that this answer does not address.

EDIT Getting close to finishing answering your excellent questions.  So exciting to see all of the interest in this important topic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get through all of them right now.  But, I/we will continue to answer questions as they are posted over the next week or so, so feel free to continue this discussion!  Thanks everyone!! ---Prof. Prather

EDIT Still answering at 12:15 CA time so you can sneak in a question now if you would like...we will also post more relevant links later to this part of our response so please feel free to check back. -Prof. Prather
-Prof. Prather

OK, after nearly 3 hours...signing off for now, but will be checking back.  Will add more info -- there are lots of links that address many of these questions.  If you have other questions or would like suggestions on good refs, let us know and we will do our best to provide. Thanks everyone.  That was great!!  -- Prof. Prather

EDIT 2:45 pm CA time...I am back on to answer a few more questions!  Working on them now....-Prof. Prather

EDIT 3:05 CA time....Logging back off but we will continue to check and update. -Prof. Prather","2015-07-28 11:27:52","2031","229","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3evxgv/science_ama_series_american_chemical_society_ama/","True","AmerChemSocietyAMA","1747841433.8639634","sea level projections","manual"
