As if sea level rise would be the only problem we will face - and we *will* face those problems, including mass starvation, mass migration and resulting wars, collapse of the fossil fuel economy, and on and on. By the time people get around to thinking that a wall like the one you imagine would be a good idea, the technology and wealth needed to build it will be a thing of the past.","2017-11-09 22:43:49","10","balanosphere","1747866841.4000044","sea level projections","manual"

Sea level rise is one of many symptoms of the problem. It's always been the most visual one on the media, it certainly is a problem itself if you're on the coast. But it is one of many issues that will develop as the Earth heats up, and your solution doesn't address any of the others.","2017-11-10 00:01:05","2","Rhaedas","1747866841.4158063","sea level projections","manual"

This assumes that democrat politicians actually try to solve climate change. Obama loosened the rules that made fast tracking of pipelines possible. Fracking increased exponentially during the Obama administration. 1/2 of all the carbon emitted since the beginning of the industrial revolution has been emitted since 1988, meaning that for the past 29 years, 16 of them have been with a democrat as president. Our government doesn't give a shit about climate change, it cares about growth.","2017-11-10 03:07:03","1","[deleted]","1747866841.4158063","sea level projections","manual"
