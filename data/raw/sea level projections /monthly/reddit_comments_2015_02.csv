Vox-mundi, who has been regularly following  the Sao Paulo water crisis at Peakoil.com, has a [brief post illustrating this deforestation of Brazil's Atlantic Forest](http://peakoil.com/forums/post1237492.html#p1237492).

A recent Time article states that political corruption in Brazil cannot be fixed:

>[**5 reasons why Brazil is getting close to the brink**](http://time.com/3716995/brazil/)

>...**Corruption isn’t going away**

>Campaigning for her re-election last year, President Dilma Rousseff touted the state-run oil company Petrobras for creating 74,000 new jobs. Yet, an ever-deepening [corruption scandal](http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21643224-one-many-casualties-petrobras-scandal-misguided-industrial-policy-whose-oil) has engulfed the company and the government. Prosecutors report at least $730 million in “suspicious payments” on Petrobras contracts; the former purchasing chief indicated that 3% of his division’s contracts were provided to Rousseff’s Worker’s Party and allies for personal use or campaign finance. According to federal prosecutors, there are 232 companies [currently under investigation](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/850711b6-ac78-11e4-9d32-00144feab7de,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F850711b6-ac78-11e4-9d32-00144feab7de.html%3Fsiteedition%3Dintl&siteedition=intl&_i_referer=#axzz3S2e0sCSW).

>...**Why was the limit set at 2°C?** 

>*It was pretty much arbitrary, but characterized by policy and political folks* as the amount of warming that the scientific community had established would “prevent dangerous” climate impacts. Danger, of course, being a relative concept. Former NASA scientist James Hansen and other researchers have concluded that 2°C of human-made warming would trigger natural feedbacks that could end up doubling that amount of warming. Setting the limit was widely seen, however, as one of the few positive outcomes from the 2009 U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen... - [Link](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/climate-goal-2-degrees-misguided-18121)

By all evidence(both scientific and individual observation), the [climate sensitivity of the Earth is much higher than most know](http://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-sensitivity-advanced.htm) and even a 1ºC rise is too much. [The idea that staying at or just below a 2ºC warming can be a safe target for limiting damage is a myth](http://www.climatecodered.org/2014/08/dangerous-climate-change-myths-and.html).

>[Definition of climate sensitivity](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2010/explained-climate-sensitivity):

>...the term is defined as how much the average global surface temperature will increase if there is a doubling of greenhouse gases (expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents) in the air, once the planet has had a chance to settle into a new equilibrium after the increase occurs. In other words, it’s a direct measure of how the Earth’s climate will respond to that doubling.

But in some other situations, the ones who get the short end of the stick are not the ones causing the problem. In my country, one state decided to make money cultivating things in a desert by sucking up a river. Now half of the neighbor state became a desert, without that river. Situations like this will be more common and will eventually lead to large scale violence.","2015-02-22 17:34:01","3","alecco","1747837467.2942257","sea level projections","manual"
