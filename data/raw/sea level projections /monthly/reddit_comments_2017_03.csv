Depending on the projection in 200 years you might see ~1m of rise, which would have huge consequences for coastal communities but which wouldn't be visible for the most part on a world or even regional map. 

Maps that show the level of detail you want are available in certain areas which have done their own analysis - [here's one from North Carolina](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wunc/files/styles/x_large/public/201505/apes_slr_map3.jpg) and [here's a slightly less effective one from Savannah](http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/uploads/gallery/G-GA03G_Savannahs_Rising_Seas_v2.jpg) - these are planning documents that allow the identification of vulnerable areas in a fairly granular way, but Florida won't disappear for millennia.

> The 12 percent of the world’s population that lives in North America and Western Europe accounts for 60 percent of private consumption spending,

There are 10 people sharing a pizza, 1 of them takes half the pizza and then complains that there are too many people to share with.

We can worry about population when all the coffee plantations and land used to grow crops for meat feed are turned over to food stock.

You are right, drastic measures are going to have to be forced upon the global 1% to curb their out of control consumption. No more meat for every meal. No more luxuries like coffee and chocolate. No more throwing away food while people starve.

It's westerners gluttony not babies in the global south.

The demographic differences will sort themselves out.  3rd World countries that have had high birth rates will have the highest death rates.  The amount of migration will dwindle rapidly, currently it depends on buses, trains and oil powered boats crossing the Mediterranean Sea.  Without that, people are not going to be walking from Bolivia and even make it as far as Mexico.  Certainly not walking from Somalia to Sweden. lol.

Every and any problem that ills mankind today will not get solved by individual actions, especially in our modern liberal (and decaying) society where morality is pretty much in the ultimate form of subjectivization. I plan to write about this topic shortly.

The things is they also seemed to like blood sacrifices and tended to have animal/dragon heads.

What if they are heading back to Harvest their Human Cattle Crop from Ranch Earth?

Heads of Humans > 7.5 billion and climbing.

How much on the galactic market for an Earthling Burger at McHumans.

About 2 billion people malnourished (free range ) and about 2 billion obese (froie gras).

It's not nice but it is also a valid solution to the Fermi Paradox, have you seen anyone setting up cultural exchange programs with Cows, Sheep, Chicken or Fish.  Or met a farm animal that even grasps what a human is, think about it...

And if you could use a whole planet as a cattle ranch wouldn't you want to Uplift* the cattle enough to look after themselves.

If these Alien farmers/ranchers have faster than light travel they might also have time travel, which could explain why we hardly ever see them.  Imagine a time travelling farmer/rancher, let animals loose on land time jump to check harvest and make some adjustments if harvest under quota, e.g. deal with predators, rescue/remove leading cows/bulls depending on behaviours. (wow I'm still here)!

*Uplift the concept of genetically enhancing more primitive species to be self sufficient and possibly even surpass the uplifter's potential.

Liberals, conservatives and alt-righters alike will have to overcome their queasiness and slip on the jackboots if they wish to save western liberalism/the welfare state, the constitution/ free markets or the white race/western civilization respectively; lest it become an illiberal Islamic theocracy or Brazil 2.0.
