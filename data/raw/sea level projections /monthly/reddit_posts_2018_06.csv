"8rwzv8","collapse","skeptical","What do you envision for the coming decades?","I'm struggling with two main threads of angst regarding what the future holds. As a parent, I feel compelled to not ignore them. 

The main topic of concern is climate change. The other topic pertains to social drift toward an Orwellian government, oligarchy and fascism. The two are related.

The climate thing has a cliffhanger vibe in my outlook. I see a lot of technological potential for humanity to move toward a more sustainable model. I think advances with batteries, desalination, synthetic meat and dairy. CCS, etc. will give us at least the theoretical capability to avoid an apocalypse. 

Given the delay between forcing from greenhouse levels and climate equilibrium and the fact that transition away from fossil fuels will take time, I think we're committed to increasing gg levels until at least mid-century and will approach CO2 ppm of 500 minimum. 

The inertia of sea level rise seems like we are committing ourselves for the forseeable future. I hold out the possibility, but my imagination is not latching on to anything that will move relatively warm water away from the ice sheets. 

I envision that sea level rise is the trigger for a financial shock. Flood insurance pricing and availability will be a trigger. Affected asset classes include coastal real estate, mortgage loans, government bonds and fossil fuel reserves. A region like S. Florida will lose a lot of desirability as it's beaches disappear before most essential infrastructure is inundated. 

I'm seeing the timing of the financial shock as being a function of confidence in sea level rise projections. If the data for the next 5 years confirms moderate to bad projections about marine ice sheet instability, we may need only another 6 inches of sea level rise before the market prices the risks fully. 

Coastal municipal governments will not have the resources to fund adaptation and mitigation efforts and will be faced with a declining tax base. It's going to be up to federal governments and international agreements to make triage decisions and step up investments in energy, adaptation and mitigation. 

The committment required to transform our infrastructure and deal with the collateral damage will be no less than what the world put into the great wars of the 20th century. 

How are current oligarchy serving government and media institutions going to evolve? I don't know the answer to that question. Part of me thinks that necessity is the mother of invention and we'll come together and another part of me is imagining the Grapes of Wrath on steroids. 

We live in interesting times and I think a big test is approaching faster than we think.
