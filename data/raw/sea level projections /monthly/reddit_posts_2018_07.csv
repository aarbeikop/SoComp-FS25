"8wfti0","climatechange","action-oriented","Why sea level rise (SLR) is a better benchmark for climate change than global temperature (personal opinion).","Just winging it here with no notes. 

It goes without saying that the primary climate impacts of increased of increased greenhouse emissions include a warmer atmosphere, warmer ocean and increased ocean acidity. If there are other primary effects, feel free to chime in. 

For arguments sake, I'll consider the warmer ocean leading to a more voluminous ocean as a secondary effect. 

**Limitations of Temperature Data**

1) *Continuum*

Temperature is a quality which exists in a continuum. While certain temperature thresholds may in fact represent critical tipping points, our lack of observational record makes it something of a guessing game. The Paris Accord calls for goals of 1.5C or 2.0C, but there is no smoking gun to inform us of the critical tipping points. 

2) *The Consequence of Heat Alone*

This is an extension of the first point. Since we don't have a good idea of the tipping points, adaption to and future distribution of heat, we can't easily project how many people / critters / fauna will be effected by it becoming simply too hot to live in a particular place.

That said, critter migration is clearly evident.

3) *Uneven Distribution*

Humans aren't going to experience global temperature, they are going to experience local temperature. While the overall trend is obviously toward warming, the variation around the globe is significant, particularly at the two poles. For climate / weather discussion among experts, this unequal distribution is more easily understood and navigated, but most of us aren't experts and laypersons can easily get bogged down with this. 

4) *Wide Range of Potential Outcomes*

We simply don't have a clear idea of how warn it's going to get, largely as a result of not understanding where the tipping points are for the release of large carbon deposits in places like the Arctic. 

5) *Paleo-Climate Record*

The historical record doesn't reveal evidence of temperature as accurately as it does some other variables. We have 30-40M years of ice deposits to draw from to give us a good idea of atmospheric gas composition and a fossil record, but temperature leaves a less certain trail. 

**Superior Attributes of Sea Level Rise**

*Chemical*

Water has a chemical composition and properties unique to it's chemistry. Ocean water has a lot of salt in it. 

*Clear Tipping Points*

The outcomes of sea level rise are more predictable than increased heating. The shifts between binary states is more obvious.  The most dramatic for us is that we can't breathe underwater. Safe drinking has a well defined chemical composition. If salt infiltrates our drinking water, we know that we need to desalinate. 

3) *Sea Level is Relatively Evenly Distributed*

The oceans are all connected. There is a fair amount of variation regionally due to changes in gravitational forces, ocean currents and land subsidence, but not as much variation as with atmospheric temperature. The opportunity for a debate to be thrown into confusion over the regional variation is much less. 

4) *Sea Level Rise Appears to Be Becoming Increasingly Predictable*

The proof of this is not here yet but early results show promise. The principal tool which has advanced the observational record is weather satellites. Satellites have enabled us to map the topography below the glaciers and determine the ice which is vulnerable to ocean infiltration. Satellites also measure sea level at thousands of locations and ice mass so we can determine how much ice is melting. 

Sensors have been extensively deployed to provide measures of ocean temp and salinity at a variety of depths adjacent to the glaciers. 

Observational science has yielded information about the properties of ice sheets which we hadn't witnessed prior to the last several decades and enabled us to construct models which can be used to reconcile paleo-climate observations.

The experiment to determine if we are able to predict SLR is underway and we should expect to get a very good idea in the next decade how well the models hold up. 

It should be pointed out that some alternative ideas around volcanic activity as a root cause of ice melt vs. AGW exist. If the hockey stick emerges in the melt data as predicted by the emerging consensus, the volcanic cause proponents will have their work cut out for them to refute the emerging consensus.

Note: Since most of the science relating to marine ice sheet instability (MISI) has emerged in the last 5 years, very little SLR associated with MISI was reflected in the 2013 IPCC AR5. Therefore, I am using the 2017 US National Climate Assessment as my proxy for the ""emerging consensus"". 

5) *The Paleoclimate Record is Clear*

~ 15,000 years ago, sea levels rose 1+ foot per decade for 400-500 years. This is an order of magnitude faster than current SLR and is only explainable by runaway ice sheet melting. 

It should be clear that the ice which melted during this interval is no longer on earth and the identical scenario will not be repeated. It is merely a rough analog for what could occur if another runaway episode is triggered. 
 
**Summary**

Feedback and serious criticisms are welcome. This is just a stream of consciousness and a conversation starter.

"8w4tvr","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2018 Q2","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.
 
I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.
 
I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.
