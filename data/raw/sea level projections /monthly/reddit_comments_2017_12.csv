Access to research **must** be free, it is paramount for development, however, publishing articles is a business, and like all  companies doing business, they want to make as much money as possible. I'm not happy that access to an article costs an arm and a leg (especially if you're from a developing country) but at least I know why they are charging what they charge.

I can imagine the gaint publishing companies telling institutes that they would provide free access even to paid articles, provided they use the said ISP to access the internet. While this might not exactly be feasible (owing to pre-existing infrastructure) it may be that way or newer schools/colleges.

Going off topic a bit, but I think in recent years, corporates have become more and more greedy, and they aren't afraid to show their greediness! They know that consumers are gonna come to them regards, so they can go ahead and do anything they want. It seems that free market is just an illusion. 

To these corporates, we are not people. We are consumers.

"dr1fjtc","t3_7iu13o","7iu13o","science","scientific","Hi Ryan, and thank you for doing this AMA.

I’ll be honest, I haven’t followed the debate around net neutrality closely. But I am dubious of some of the arguments I have seen pop up to defend it.

The idea of net neutrality seems pretty simple. The company that connects your device to the internet should not be able to discriminate among users and content provides in terms of the level of service provided.

At first glance this sounds reasonable. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if this is not over-regulation.

Why is it a bad idea to offer people services in line with their intended use? One size fit all policies are rarely optimal. To use cable as an analogy, I love being able to configure my cable package to fit my consumption preferences (premium channels, no ESPN). It seems like offering companies the opportunity to think about possible bundling options and offering a discrete a la cartel menu like this may be a good thing for consumers.

I wonder if continued de-regulation would be a good thing. Especially at the ISP level. In the current setting, I agree a worry over repealing net neutrality may be that people who lack other ISP options cannot vote with their wallets. But the better solution seeems to be to promote competition rather than enact regulations that favor companies already in the market.","2017-12-10 15:21:18","16","SirT6","1747867321.1003933","sea level projections","manual"

 It seems a little extreme to think in this manner at first, but a single company owning access to all the media in specific regions is dangerous. I think it's the government's responsibility to make sure, in this specific case, that people have reasonable access to information from whatever source they wish to get it.

In the interest of understanding the issue from both sides, and not jumping on the hate train that has built up a great momentum over the months, could we talk about the positives of the repeal of net neutrality for the regular people?  

I am someone who loves music very much. I pay a lot of money to have an unlimited-everything plan right now. I use about 15 gigabytes a month on youtube, which makes up 90% of my bandwidth. Would the repeal of net neutrality make it possible for me to buy a cheaper plan that gives me unlimited youtube and 1 gb for everything else?

"dr1funj","t3_7iu13o","7iu13o","science","scientific","As someone with a rudimentary understanding of Net-Neutrality, could I just ask that we could state the very basic, uncontroversial pros and cons of each side?

From the very light research I have been doing, it seems that if we vote to keep Net-Neutrality, we are essentially saying that the Net is a public utility, based on the fact that it was largely publicly funded. But this then opens the door for government to start regulating the internet based on that very fact. Other public utilities are almost without exception regulated by the government. As far as I know, this is hardly ever mentioned as a part of the discussion.

On the other side of the argument you have the potential for ISP's and private corporations to have ""total control"" which has the potential to be very bad, but isn't limited to that. Right now a lot of people only have one real option for ISP's, and retracting Net-Neutrality would open up the competitive market more to have more variable prices and services. And there is also the possibility that a service offering unhindered access to the internet with no strings attached would be highly favored on the free market. It just needs to be available to consumers with as close to full transparency as possible. Which may very well be a pipe dream.

Still, I don't see anyone mentioning the fact that keeping Net-Neutrality is enabling the government to invite themselves in to regulating it. Am I wrong about this? **edit** *Obviously this question implies I was expecting some sort of correction. u/IolausTelcontar has pointed out that government regulation would be restricted due to the First Amendment.*

If someone wants to correct me on any of this I will be happy to edit my comment to reflect those corrections. As well as any additional uncontroversial pros and cons. ","2017-12-10 15:28:55","6","[deleted]","1747867321.1245553","sea level projections","manual"

"dr1gq5x","t3_7iu13o","7iu13o","science","scientific","This is what my representative replied to me with about Net neutrality. 

“Thank you for contacting me regarding the internet, net neutrality, and Title II. I greatly value your feedback and appreciate this opportunity to respond.

I have enjoyed robust time hearing from, and speaking with the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Chairman Ajit Pai.  In speaking with him, I have confidence that he will act within the FCC's jurisdiction to ensure we spur broadband development, create jobs, boost competition and choice, secure online privacy, and restore internet freedom. 

In 1996 President Clinton and a Republican Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 with language such as, ""preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet…unfettered by Federal or State regulation.""  And since 1996 this is exactly what we as a nation have experienced. 

In 2015 the FCC impulsively changed its tone to one of partisanship, applying Title II regulations to the Internet.  Title II is a utility-styled regulation that vastly expands the government's control over the internet.  In fact, Title II regulations date all the way back to 1934 with the Communications Act of 1934, a staggering six decades before the conversation surrounding internet governance even began.  In addition to Title II being outdated, its intent decades ago was to address a telephone monopoly, far before the notion of the internet.  We are seeing this trend far too often; government attempting to regulate new and emerging technologies with far outdated rules and regulations. 

On May 18th 2017, the FCC began considering the repeal of Title II, and with it what I believe are the misguided Internet regulations of the previous administration that have declined broadband network investment, shelved new broadband infrastructure deployments, cost thousands of jobs through lack of investment, and weakened Americans' privacy while operating on the internet.  Title II put the government in a position to give approval, as opposed to its decades-long oversight role.  I believe this move by the previous administration's FCC was based on fears of future hypothetical harms, ignoring the flourishing internet over the past twenty-plus years.  This is no way to regulate.

Similarly to the recent Internet Service Provider (ISP) discussion, there is a great deal of misinformation surrounding this issue.  Also akin to the ISP conversation, this has to do with the right agency regulating the right content and action.  The implementation of Title II regulations on the internet reduced Americans' privacy by moving oversight from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the FCC.  For decades, our nation's Internet privacy and oversight experts have been housed within the FTC, and the 2015 action to remove this oversight was a severe blow to internet privacy. I commend Chairman Pai for repealing what I believe was a confusing, bureaucratic, and ineffective move under the previous administration's FCC.

I look forward to the continued competition between broadband providers and the backing of new entrants to the marketplace.  I applaud the repeal of Title II, and a return to an open internet, investment in broadband, and innovation.  

For further insight into Chairman Ajit Pai's plans as Chairman of the FCC, please find an hour-long interview here: https://soundcloud.com/fdrlst/fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-on-net-neutrality-privacy-and-rickrolling.

I am greatly honored to serve you in Congress and look forward to future correspondence with you.  Please contact me if you have future questions or concerns that I may assist you with.”

I'm a faculty research scientist working on wide area networks, and have been working closely with folks at SoX and Internet2 for a couple of years now. I am *very* pro-net neutrality for commodity internet connections, but I also understand proper use of bandwidth shaping and network flow management which are legitimate tools that ISPs must use in a transparent manner on inter-network connections, not at end user connections.

>How will this impact scientists' abilities to collaborate on projects?

Surprisingly little, at least for university and research institute-based researchers.

Because of the costs of commodity internet connections, Research and Education Networks (RENs) have existed for at least 20 years. (The Abilene network is the first one I can think of, which transitioned to become Internet2.) They exist at the regional level (SoX in the southeast), state level (FLR in Florida), and national level (Internet2 and ESNet). 

This provides a second, much, much, much cheaper path between academic institutes. As such, at campus routers, the default route to other academic institutes is through the REN path, rather than going over a commodity network, like Hurricane Electric, AT&T, or Comcast. For instance, say /u/asbruckman (who's writing in this thread) wanted to get data from Berkeley to her lab at Georgia Tech. Rather than going over the commodity connection, the data would go from Berkeley over CENIC (the California REN), transit through Internet2, go through SoX (the south east's REN), and show up at Georgia Tech. It's basically like a commodity network.

However, they are not commodity networks. All these networks are private. They make their own rules. As such, net neutrality *isn't usually a thing* on the networks. You are able to reserve bandwidth from point A to point B. For instance, I could reserve bandwidth and a VLAN from Emory to UMass Medical across Internet2 if I needed real time access to a networked fluoroscope (those exist, right?). This is *very much against* net neutrality, however it's a *very* reasonable thing to be able to do on a private research network.

So, to wrap this discussion up: a very large portion of inter-academic traffic does not transverse commodity internet connections, rather it uses private research and education networks to bypass commodity's costs and limitations for real time and bandwidth intensive transfers.","2017-12-10 16:44:34","2","donjuansputnik","1747867321.1409726","sea level projections","manual"

"dr1oa6e","t3_7iu13o","7iu13o","science","scientific","From the startup perspective we are exiting the heady days when the initial barrier to entry for software startups was relatively low. From the late 90's through to about 2012 it was easy to distribute software or a software service in a relatively open, free market. Google, Netflix, Facebook, some of the largest and most successful companies in the tech field today grew rapidly inside this startup-friendly environment. This is all changing fast and  the knock-on effects of this change may bring the current tech bubble to an abrupt and destructive end. 

First, there is the existing trend towards closed marketplaces on the device side. These are being pushed by device manufacturers (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon) who see both an ability to profit and to strictly control the marketplace. Google can pull Youtube from the Amazon marketplace, Apple can block apps they don't like or insist on exclusivity for others, Microsoft can refuse to allow office competitors, etc. 

These ""walled gardens"" have some benefits and there is incentive for device manufactures to allow successful apps to thrive, since they get a cut of the profits. After all, device manufacturers are still tech companies focused on delivering highly appealing devices to consumers
 They understand innovation in some context and company politics are guided by this innate understanding of the balancing act that walled gardens represent. 

The fall of net neutrality will trigger a darker, much more cataclysmic type of market control, allowing telecoms, who are not technology companies and who do not remotely understand or value the spirit of innovation to excert even greater control over the market than any single device manufacturer ever could. 

If you don't like Apple's platform you can choose between Microsoft or Google, or a FOSS solution like GNU-Linux. For most Americans their choice of ""broadband"" provider is non-existent due to the regional monopoly system that telecoms have used to divide up the American market and eliminate consumer choice.

This gives absolute power to the telecoms to control which applications can even function on their network. The fact that many telecoms have venture funds implies that they fully understand the wide level of control that they can excert to manipulate the market and they stand to make a fortune if the removal of net neutrality expands this power. 

Comcast, for example, has a large venture fund that invests in startups and already sells themselves on being able to provide their captive customers and customer data as a perk. With the fall of net neutrality Comcast ventures (a private company) will suddenly be able to excert undue influence by giving startups a simple choice: allow Comcast to own part of your company and get preferential treatment or go with someone else (or no venture firm at all) and be locked out of Comcast's large customer base. 

This situation is almost identical to Mafia collection on businesses that fall within their territory. Pay us, or we will keep your customers away.

For investors going forward it will be risky to back the company with the best idea, as opposed to the company backed by a telecom. This will crush innovation and push America into a digital dark age, allowing companies based in outside markets to be selected for quality of product or service over association with a monopoly player. 

America is giving up control over tech leadership with the loss of net neutrality.","2017-12-10 18:18:28","2","F_D_P","1747867321.1589208","sea level projections","manual"

*Does this seem like the beast consuming itself in a sense?*

In that this is the price we have to pay for the rapid expansion of technology in the past 20-odd years. I feel like all of this is coming to a head right now because we're on the brink of collectively seeing the internet as a universal right and not just an extraneous convenience. 

I personally don't know if I would even be able function in the world without an internet connection; be it getting to and from work and school or even having access to basic medical services.

I think a lot of people in the US are getting to a point in which this is also true for them. Handing over these rights to the corporations right now is crucial while we're in that sweet spot between these two paradigms. 

I'm really just fearful for a future in which access to the whole internet is in the hands of ruthless corporations. Our lives will never be the same again. What can we do to fix this? Is there anything *to* be done? Or is it too late at this point?","2017-12-11 04:02:27","2","Sloanosaurus-Nick","1747867321.1768286","sea level projections","manual"
