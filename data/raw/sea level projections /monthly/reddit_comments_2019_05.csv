Don't you think though that our current civilization is rather unique in that it is a global one, and reliant on a host of very specialized technologies that will be hard to keep going unless the whole gig rolls? Computers, electric grids, cars. How do you imagine those keeping going for meaningful span of time? Mayans didn't have any of this. Almost anyone could fashion a simple digging tool and had the skills to grow food. But what will most of us do when electricity becomes unreliable? When industrial fossil fuel extraction grinds to a halt, so does modern agriculture.

Nowadays we're talking about continent-sized chunks of land becoming nigh-uninhabitable by century end, and likely those will be those areas which are now the most populous (sea level rise plus desertification). Weapons also have evolved immensely, to the point where a tiny number of well-armed individuals can hold in check entire populations.

"eoa4r4q","t3_br0vtq","br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","Thanks for the well thought out post.  

I largely agree with everything you say.  There’s obviously variables that make this collapse more unpredictable.  History doesn’t repeat as much as it rhymes after all.

One of the variables that make this unique, aside from the obvious ones frequently mentioned (ie sixth mass extinction event, nuclear stockpiles, WWIII, global food system, runaway climate change, etc) is the resiliency of people and communities.  I am speaking from the perspective of the US, but what I see are communities ill-equipped to weather the storm well.  Replacing communities of diverse skill-sets, capitalism found more efficiency in a hyper-specialized approach.  On top of that most people don’t have the tools to offer lasting value to their communities nor the mental scar tissue to adapt well when change demands it.  

As with anything, and maybe there’s some perspective you can share, but the bigger you are, the harder you fall.  That’s where I think we’re different in this time.

> We are not the first civilization to collapse

On the contrary - we _are_ the first world-spanning civilization to collapse.

Here's your list of examples back at you:

> Mesopotamia, Egypt, Bronze Age Agean, the Olmec, the Maya, Wari, Tiwanaku, the Romans, the Mississippians, the Anasazi, Angkor, Great Zimbabwe,

(That's Aegean, btw...)

All of these societal collapses had the same thing in common - if you lived two thousand miles away during the collapse, you wouldn't even know anything was going on.  

The fall of the Roman Empire, an area in history I know well, deserves an asterisk there.  It spanned a significant portion of the globe... but it wasn't really a collapse in the sense we're looking at but a slow, slow decay over hundreds of years.  Most of its citizens during its ""fall"" would have not even known that anything was fallen.

Look at a graph of population over time (yes, I know these are not so accurate, but the shapes are good).  None of these collapses prevented its overall upwards curve.  The biggest dips in the world's population in the past weren't even collapses but epidemics, and they were very temporary - tiny blips in the curve.

Now we're going to see the world population systematically decline for a long time.  Very different to anything that happened before.

> Different in scale, but not in process. 

But differences in scale - particularly order-of-magnitude differences - are _everything_.  They result in a completely different process.

This is true of absolutely everything in the world - if you scale some real world thing upwards or downwards by a factor of ten it completely changes it.

Losing a finger would be distressing.  Losing all your fingers would be devastating.

But we're talking about a collapse that's two orders of magnitude bigger than anything we've seen

Perhaps the greatest collapse was the Roman Empire.  But at its height, it contained about 50 million people, perhaps 20% of the world's population, and that collapse lasted for centuries.  Farmland was basically untouched, natural resources were basically untouched.

Now we're talking about a collapse that will involve eight billion people, play out over decades, and leave us with a degraded ecosystem and universal resource depletion - yes, even topsoil.

The previous collapses affected at most millions of people.  This collapse will affect _billions_ of people.

"eobncar","t3_br0vtq","br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","I appreciate the historical perspective that you provide to put our situation in context. I would offer that you even put forward a caveat that WW III would hasten the collapse. You also say that collapses happen when the leaders of a society are unable to deal with the problems that society faces. I just want to offer some of the principle themes from this sub on why people think collapse is going to happen quickly.

1. Environmental - the hottest topic, pun completely intended. The rate of ice loss over the last 50 years is staggering. In this area, we can think of collapse beginning 50 years ago and we're finally seeing effects in populated places in the world. We've pushed this ball over the crest, and there's nothing we can do to keep it from rolling downhill. I won't spend too much time dealing with this subject because I'm sure you know about it and it's covered exhaustively here, but suffice to say that the dangers of widespread crop failures and changing climate patterns are real and present.
2. Economic - Ten years have passed since the Great Recession began, and people still talk about it in terms of ""recovery."" IMO, this is because we never actually recovered. The false recovery has been shown through stock prices and the wealth of the upper 10%. Employment took 7-8 years to recover, and wages still have not recovered - this is abnormal. Furthermore, the steps central banks took to combat the Great Recession were window dressings, and structural reform was ignored. The West has left itself highly exposed to widespread effects from the next recession. Interest rates are so low that there's little a central bank can do to spur growth. People still don't have savings, and government debt to GDP ratios are very high even though the economy is ""booming."" Basically, the rich are fleecing the Earth and controlling the governments in order to enable themselves. An economic tinderbox has been stuffed full. 
3. Political - Leaders have abdicated the responsibility of fixing the problems we face. In Great Britain, Theresa May talked about climate change as though it's the next generation's problem to fix. Australia is doubling down on coal. The US has moved rapidly backwards on climate action. People who are experts are ignored in favor of people who are loud pundits - in fact, a pundit was elected President of the United States. But let me emphasize that the problems will not go away when the next President comes into office. The structural problems in the US government have been ignored for 50 years, basically ever since it went completely to fiat currency. The work of balancing the budget in the 90s was blown up along with the towers in 2001. Leaders on both sides of the political spectrum have been unwilling to place the US government on sound financial footing. Very soon, a tipping point will be reached where the government will have to borrow money to pay the interest on the debt. Eventually, global bankers will lose confidence in the US's ability to back the dollar. The problems aren't just federal either. Many states and municipalities face enormous budget problems that they are politically unwilling to correct.
4. Societal - A much more philosophical topic to be sure. What is the ""right"" way for society to be? How are people supposed to treat one another? People are disconnected in real life and highly connected, albeit in a depressed way, online. This is not a support structure that can resist a real collapse. Even though the solutions to the problems are social and political, people are retreating into isolationism and creating their fortresses to defend themselves from the coming collapse. I would say that the America I knew as a kid was highly patriotic - I haven't seen that society in a while. One could argue that Bush took us to war with ""terror,"" in order to provide a goal for a society that was losing its way. He was looking for a patriotic goal like fighting communism or the space race. But the war on terror was just masked xenophobia and has been an enormous waste of resources. Systemic problems have festered and we have not only lost the ability to deal with them but the will. If one was observing us from a disconnected viewpoint, they might think we want to collapse.

You might be right that this collapse will happen slowly, but 2019 is not the point when it started. One could argue environmentally that the collapse started the moment we began burning fossil fuels on a large scale. One could argue economically that collapse started when all currencies became fiat money. One could argue politically that collapse started when the oligarchy realized it could use mass media to manipulate Democracy to serve its interests. I'm sure there is an eloquent way to say collapse has started socially but my coffee cup is empty and I digress.

"eoai4ca","t3_br0vtq","br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","This is a very well written, well considered post. I've only recently been becoming much more alert to this topic. I can't say I'm particularly well-educated on it, beyond basic college environmental science and reading the book ""Collapse"" some years ago, but I have some idle thoughts as I read what you've written. 

Like you, I think that an impending collapse is not something instantaneous. However, I question your timeline for one reason: The technologies we have today, combined with the sheer magnitude of stress upon the earth's resources as a whole, along with an awareness that the pressures on those natural resources has increased exponentially since the onset of the industrial era in the late 19th century, all lead me to conclude that the gradual part has been in play for a long time already. 

The second point that comes to my mind is whether the extent of collapse is comparable. You described cities that collapsed and ultimately lead to individual civilizations collapsing, and I think your description of the process is outstanding and accurate. However, the trade routes that existed for any prior civilizations were extremely limited by comparison to the trade channels today, both in the depth of WHAT is traded, as well as the trade routes that make such a wide array of products available to such a wide array of peoples. This would seem to prolong a civilization's ability to endure as long as the resources hold out, yet the resources themselves will deplenish far faster because of the extensive demand that can be created. This would be another factor that I suspect could speed the timeline of a collapse today compared to any other point in history, and also affect more cities simultaneously than any prior collapse has seen. 

The book Collapse highlighted something like five factors that contribute to collapses. IIRC, they were a) depleted access to resources, b) diminished trade of those resources, c) political influences/war d) religious influences, and e) weather/climate change. The author made a great study of these factors and a solid argument that we are basically reliant on and subject to the earth's health. His claims wouldn't be in disagreement with yours, I think, but I noticed this book isn't on your list.

"eoa5lwq","t3_br0vtq","br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","So, a few thoughts and some expansion on your treatise. (Very well put together!)

One of the major reasons for collapse has been the inability to provide timely communication of the problems on the outskirts of the empire. For instance, taking commands to the front via horseback would mean that the logistics would need to be planned very far in advance. If commanders in Rome needed actionable information, they would have to wait for a return message, and then react accordingly. 

In today's world, we have near-instantaneous, secure communication. The global reach of the means of enforcing these commands (ie carrier strike groups, etc) guarantee a powerful response within a week or maybe even hours.

This produces a different problem - verification of threat and the effects of the attack. Was it successful? Whom did it affect, etc.

Older empires collapsed due to lack of information. 

&#x200B;

Second point - the ability for a political redress of large issues such as global warming seem beyond the capability for meaningful action other than punishing behaviors BELIEVED to be detrimental. This is not a homogeneously applied tactic. This could cause an up-welling of resistance in some areas, while others are unaffected. 

&#x200B;

Third - the warming, as you mentioned, may take a century or more to become problematic to crops. As more arable land is exposed by glacier melts, and rising sea levels drive population from the coasts, it is a good bet that adjustments will be made by corporate entities to exploit this. Having faster routes via sea lanes may reduce or negate the need for air freight. That might tilt the balance in a positive direction vis a vis the warming effects. Or not...

&#x200B;

Your thought that we are in a global empire is a decent one, but I would argue that the existence of superpowers and nuclear armed countries means that we will see more movement to corporate ownership of this problem. Multinational cooperation may end up becoming a streamlined mechanism that will allow mitigation of climate change.

Something that came up for me while reading your post and the comments was the only way this upcoming collapse will be different is in *how* humans will respond to the collapse.     


It’s clear that we are just in another cycle of collapse in human history. However, as others have pointed out, due to various reasons or variables (nuclear stockpiles, drastic changes in temperatures, etc.) the upcoming collapse will be different than the ones before.  It’s commonly agreed that this collapse will happen on a global scale.      


So what’s really different? The impacts seem to be the same (loss of habitat, economic collapses, loss of resources, starvation, etc) just at a different scale. One of the biggest differences in scale is time. In your post you wrote how long collapses have taken before, yet I think we can all agree this collapse will happen quicker and more impactful than before.     


Is scale the only thing that’s different? If it is, then nothing is really different, it’s the same thing, just a different size and duration (whether bigger or smaller than before).  However, I think there is another variable that makes this cycle of collapse truly different than the others, and that has to do with our move into the digital/information age.     


Of all the ages throughout human history, the Information Age and within it the digital age has been the first time humans have been able to convert resources into a full spectrum of possibilities (including virtual).  Technology has always held a parallel to our desire to replicate or control our environment (whether it was the natural environment or other humans).   


Previously, whenever we converted resources, we were restricted in the resulting impact. In other words, we took a physical resource and converted it into another physical resource (fire>light+heat, rock > arrowhead, steam > locomotion, gold > money, etc.). Even the letterpress still only gave way to physical paper and ink as the medium.  The discovery of electricity and the ability to harness it spawned a new phase in productivity and technological progress.  But even with electricity it was still an analog signal.  Where did the big shift happen? When we started to convert everything to ones and zeros.    


While mathematicians were already doing this before the digital age, they were still limited to theories and equations on chalkboards.  With the invention of computers, now we are able to convert a physical asset to a virtual asset.  Now electricity can create money (without a printing press), locomotion (without gasoline), entertainment (without humans), music (without instruments), and pretty much everything else we utilize in today's society.  Thanks to the digital realm, we now focus on electricity generation to run all of our modern day needs. Our limitations of resource conversion are now broken free to the infinite (along with never before seen impacts to the environment).    


Along with all this is an asset class that was limited before, Information.  Traditionally something available to nobles and upper classes of society, now information is available to almost everybody.  What's different now is the ability for information/knowledge to be a resource and not just a privilege.   


So thank you to you and everyone else who contributes on these information portals. Shitposts or posts of gold, while we head into a global collapse, we now have the possibility to actually move beyond the typical reactions that our ancestors had to collapse.  While the civilizations previously had little or no chance to impact their outcome, we might actually have one.  We now no longer have to rely on governments/traditional forms of sovereignty/power to make the changes for us.  That is what is different this time around, chance.","2019-05-21 07:03:11","7","[deleted]","1747883051.5289752","sea level projections","manual"

"eoaaqbq","t3_br0vtq","br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","That makes sense on the most part.

To add, there's alot suggesting that humans didn't magically become vastly more intelligent than our ancestors just in the last 9,000 years.  That we may have had a few cracks at forming civilization already, but ice ages suck and after 10,000 years stuck barely surviving and spending every waking moment on it, you lose your culture.  You get cavemen again.

I'd also like to point out that there's a major difference between cyclic change and systemic change.  Changing presidents/governments/civilizations isn't the same as dealing with <15% atmospheric oxygen, or doing nuclear winter.  One causes some turmoil, the other one would guarantee extinction.  There are many ways we can fuck this up and see it all go very badly very quickly in ways that aren't historically precedented.  Because the real ways to fuck it up, if they'd happened already, we wouldn't be talking about it right now.  So we suffer a certain bias there.","2019-05-21 04:04:42","4","[deleted]","1747883051.5429823","sea level projections","manual"

"eobkmkj","t3_br0vtq","br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","I'm nitpicking (becuase this is a great post with so many interesting ideas I have not come across before) but is it true that all previous civilisations have collapsed? I've often heard of Indeginous Australia, in all its diversity, referred to as the worlds longest surviving culture; though maybe one would count the genocides they faced as a collapse. But still, at least that shows humans with some potential to go on without a self inflicted political collpase like the ones you describe.

Also, and I think you kind of hint at this. When you contend that all collapse is slow, is it right to compare our modern globalised civilisation with previous, smaller localised ones? Those previous ones didn't have weapons of mass destruction mass produced and scattered around the globe. I'd imagine too that erratic weather events (yes, while not like hollywood films) could lead to huuge famines, kind of like how Mao mismanaged the environment leading to famines. Of course that wasn't collapse. But imagine, take other existential crisis's. There's the declining sperm rates which certainly will affect the rebound potential post events. The use of technology to halt a collapse could also make one 10x worse. Like, going to war for resources with previous mentioned weapons, pumping sulphates into the stratosphere, or becoming to reliant on gmos, reducing the genetic diversity in the wild and increasing the chance of disease to wipe out crops or humans. I can envision just a few of these things going wrong for it all to fall apart at once. Especially with how the global stock markets designed.

Though I do agree with you, its most likely at each of these points or crisis humans are incentivised to politically make the best of a situation... and survive, though no one really knows.... the world wars were unthinkable until they happened. The war in Syria started with a drought, I'd classify that as a collpase (wait, are we opersting on an agreed definition of collapse here? I mighta done dumb...). Capitalism seemed impossible under fuedalism until it happened. It could be we are on the cusp of a new political age better capable at avoiding collapse and don't even see it yet.","2019-05-21 13:05:45","3","[deleted]","1747883051.5509822","sea level projections","manual"

So he 'pops up' every now and then (centuries layer) when crisis's emerge to guide the last technologically advanced planet through them.

"eod2qdq","t3_br0vtq","br0vtq","collapse","skeptical","It's a good post, but it focuses too much on political considerations. Everyone here (well, most at least) agrees that what is coming is entirely unprecedented. Yes, the collapse of Mediterranean cultures in distant antiquity and the Mayay in the classical Yucatan can provide some interesting insights. However devastating those collapses were, the baseline environment was not radically altered. (or at least, you could walk away from whatever denuded chunk of Earth you happen to be inhabiting). The only other collapse that could even somewhat forecast what is coming is the collapse of Easter Island. An island entirely stripped of its forests and forced into a period of cannibalism- even then, sea life was still plentiful in the vicinity. Easter Island then was like Earth now- there are no trade routes off of Earth from which to import critical resources, we're just going to have to deal with too many people too few resources in a short period of time. Human beings are terrible at managing change.","2019-05-21 19:40:08","3","CATTROLL","1747883051.555982","sea level projections","manual"

I haven’t enjoyed the comments however, as is normal on this sub. The vast majority of people here are filled with negativity and a quitter’s outlook, hoping to wake up tomorrow to a burning world so they can enjoy the apocalypse. 

I don’t know what turns a human into this, and I don’t want to know. But it’s the exact opposite of what a human has been for millennia, we have repeatedly faced problems and overcome challenges, over and over again, despite how impossible they may seem, that’s what made us who we are, and that’s the type of attitude we need now more than ever.
