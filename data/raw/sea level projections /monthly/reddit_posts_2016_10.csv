"55wu3f","collapse","skeptical","Fair reminder: We won't rebuild civilization","-How was the first oil extracted? You stuck a spade in the ground and it spew out. That oil is now gone. How is today's remaining oil extracted? You dig holes into the ground, inject steam, carbon dioxide or other gasses to mobile the oil, then use expensive refineries to convert the product into something that resembles oil as we used to know it.

-How complex is the technology needed to extract a 90% pure copper ore? Not very complex. How complex is the technology needed to extract 0.45% pure copper? A lot more complex. Giant machinery is needed to create the kind of large scale project that's efficient and financially viable. But how do you extract the copper, if you need to start over again, without all of the giant machinery?

-What did medieval people use to build houses, churches, ships and melt metals? Wood. What happened to those forests? We chopped them down, progressively depleting them until we became dependent upon coal for activities that formally used wood.

-How did pre-industrial people have thriving farms with fertile crops, in widely differing environments, able to tolerate wildly differing conditions and resistant to a variety of plagues? Biodiversity, produced by generations of selective breeding. What happened to these rare breeds? They lost them during the transition to industrial agriculture. Relying on biodiversity to prohibit the spread of disease was replaced with relying on pesticides.

-About a quarter of Southern African adults have HIV/AIDS. The disease is kept under control and kept from spreading through advanced modern medicine. Adults with the virus can now be found in every country around the world. What happens to that virus when we can't afford the anti-retroviral drugs anymore?

-Is it still cost-effective to build steel reinforced concrete infrastructure in the future, [when the life expectancy of this infrastructure is reduced by anywhere up to 31% due to higher co2 concentrations in the atmosphere?](http://www.dovetailinc.org/report_pdfs/2016/dovetailconcrete0816.pdf)

-Half the world's population lives within 60 km of the sea, and three-quarters of all large cities are located on the coast. If the sea level continues to rise for the next 500 years, as is generally expected, how will we construct the type of cities we know today? Rome wasn't built in one day, by the time you'd be halfway through, the city would be underwater. Perhaps more importantly, how do you build big cities near coasts, [when sea level rise causes tsunamis due to the higher pressure creating underwater landslides](http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/yes-climate-change-may-cause-more-tsunamis-no-thats-not-alarmism.html)?

-How will you keep all those nice inventions of yours from falling into the wrong hands, of people who could use them to create profound damage? What happens to biological and chemical weapons? What happens to our nuclear weapons, located in such stable countries like Pakistan, North Korea, Israel and soon to be Iran? What happens to all the nuclear waste stored everywhere? Any city or country that seeks to maintain stability will find itself harmed by instability elsewhere.

When it falls apart, we won't be able to rebuild it.","2016-10-05 00:42:36","14","23","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/55wu3f/fair_reminder_we_wont_rebuild_civilization/","True","-triggerexpert-","1747854875.8739197","sea level projections","manual"
