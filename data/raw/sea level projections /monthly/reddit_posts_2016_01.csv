""According to Dr David Viner, a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia,within a few years winter snowfall will become “a very rare and exciting event”.
“Children just aren’t going to know what snow is,” he said.

Australia’s “permanent” drought 2007: Tim Flannery (Australian Climate Commissioner) “So even the rain that falls isn’t actually going to fill our dams and river systems” … 2008: David Jones (Australian Bureau of Meteorology) “There is a debate in the climate community, after … close to 12 years of drought, whether this is something permanent” … 2009: Bertrand Timbal (Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research) “But we are just not going to have that sort of good rain again as long as the system is warming up.”

1976: A cooling trend has set in – perhaps one akin to the Little Ice Age Professor Stephen Schneider, back in 1976:
“I have cited many examples of recent climatic variability and repeated the warnings of several well-known climatologists that a cooling trend has set in–perhaps one akin to the Little Ice Age–and that climatic variability, which is the bane of reliable food production, can be expected to increase along with the cooling.” Stephen Schneider, The Genesis Strategy, New York:Plenum, 1976, p. 90
The late Stephen Schneider then went on to become one of the world’s leading Global Warming alarmists

Click here to see the video “Greenhouse Conspiracy” where he first tries to deny his previous global cooling view until the interviewer catches him out by reciting a passage from Schneider’s first book where he warns of a cooling trend akin to the Little Ice Age. https://anhonestclimatedebate.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/must-see-video-greenhouse-conspiracy/

NASA GISS: A new global temperature record will be set in 2009 or 2010 Given our expectation of the next El Niño beginning in 2009 or 2010, it still seems likely that a new global temperature record will be set within the next 1-2 years, despite the moderate negative effect of the reduced solar irradiance.

Arctic summers ice-free ‘by 2013’ 2007: Professor Wieslaw Maslowski
“Our projection of 2013 for the removal of ice in summer is not accounting for the last two minima, in 2005 and 2007,” the researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, explained to the BBC.
“So given that fact, you can argue that may be our projection of 2013 is already too conservative.”

In the 2020s, an intense heatwave equal to the longest on record from 1951 to 1999 is likely to occur as many as five times a decade in parts of the United States In the 2020s, an intense heatwave equal to the longest on record from 1951 to 1999 is likely to occur as many as five times a decade in parts of the United States — even if global temperatures rise by only one degree Celsius, it said.
The 2030s could be even hotter, with more and longer heatwaves and a spike in extreme seasonal temperatures in the United States.

"3zjy4e","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: We're NOAA and NASA scientists on the Jason-3 satellite mission set to launch January 17, used to observe global sea surface height, AUA!","Hi everybody! 

We’re a group from NOAA and NASA working on the Jason-3 satellite, which will provide altimetry observations of global sea surface height. These data provide critical information forecasters need to predict devastating hurricanes, severe weather, and surface wave heights that can affect shipping and offshore operations. For over 20 years, the Jason series of satellites (and their predecessor TOPEX/Poseidon), have helped to track global sea level rise, one of the main symptoms of climate change, and other climate phenomena such as El Niño. Data from Jason-3 will be added to this record and will be vital in helping to improve climate prediction models. Eventually we will also repurpose Jason-2 into its new role of mapping the ocean floor. Before we launch our new spacecraft, we're ready to answer your questions.


**Update 4:08 p.m. EST: Thanks so much for your great questions! We've got to get back to our regularly-scheduled science now, but we hope that you'll be watching with us when Jason-3 launches. Coverage will be carried live on NASA TV and http://nasa.gov/ntv on Jan. 17, 2016, starting at 11 a.m. EST, with liftoff targeted for 1:42 p.m. EST **
