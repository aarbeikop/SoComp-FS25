"cv0qjx4","t3_3ks5qv","3ks5qv","collapse","skeptical","The part of the atmosphere that we breathe is called the planetary boundary layer.  This is where c02 concentrations vary the most depending on how close you are to sources of c02, which hemisphere you're in, the season, etc., and c02 concentrations can be as high as 10x background concentration in certain areas.  The rising average c02 concentrations in earth's atmosphere is not that significant a factor in determining c02 in the air you breath, let alone the overall air quality.  In fact, air quality in general is much better today than it was 20 years ago due to the 1990 clean air act.","2015-09-14 02:31:36","2","8footpenguin","1747843432.2366471","sea level projections","manual"
"cv07buh","t3_3ks5qv","3ks5qv","collapse","skeptical","If **all** fossil fuels were burnt, many inland parts of the tropics and subtropics would be uninhabitable due to physiologically intolerable temperatures, and much of the world between 10-40 degrees latitude would become unproductive deserts due to precipitation shifts and desertification. However, areas polewards of the Arctic and Antarctic circles would become more productive during their summers.

So most business as usual scenarios, greenhouse emissions threaten a mass extinction of specialist species, perhaps technological civilization, and bring sustainable human populations down to a few million, rather than a few billion. If there's enough ocean stratification so that ocean photic-zone euxinia is widespread, and hydrogen sulfide releases deplete the ozone layer (as occurred in past large igneous province-driven mass extinctions) then all bets are off.  If we get a Paleocene-Eocene-type thermal excursion, then some humans will survive. If we get a Permian-Triassic scale event, I doubt we've got a chance.

However, the outcome is determined more by indirect greenhouse sequellae (ocean stratification, etc) than by the direct effects of carbon dioxide on physiology.
