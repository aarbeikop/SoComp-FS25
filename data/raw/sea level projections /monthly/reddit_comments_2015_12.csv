The surface of the earth can be the same one year to the next as heat is flowing below the surface and into the deeper ocean.  In that case, sea levels would rise.","2015-12-10 01:46:58","0","timmg","1747845466.5603814","sea level projections","manual"

Also, note the *Heat of Fusion* for water.  Very basic physics dictates (and paleo history shows) that one should expect to see ice melt and sea level rise throughout interglacial periods. ","2015-12-09 17:37:59","-1","publius_lxxii","1747845466.5618887","sea level projections","manual"

"cydkbxc","t3_3yggyd","3yggyd","climate","scientific","Sock puppet freemandyson has a history that is about 1 day old. Most of these cock sucker conservatard deniers are cowards and game players. They are the most confused people on the planet. Since the whole climate debate started in earnest when James Hansen addressed congress back in 1988 the world has used more fossil fuels every year, yet these knuckle dragger get louder and more paranoid. They even threaten climate scientists with bodily harm and death. Why would you do this if the very thing you want, more fossil fuel use, goes up every year? I can think of no greater group of useful idiots than deniers. I think the fossil fuel companies have over spent on PR big time, since the Chinese, Indians, Russians are not swayed by western propaganda nor were they targeted. It's not like liberals were giving up their high consumptive lifestyles anyway - just green washed em. I don't waste time on shit stains anymore, except maybe to remind them that their family may be the next victim of the next disaster. One can only hope. You don't really hear them arguing about the ever increasing disasters. More face down floaters in Texas today. Odds are they were deniers, so fuck em. drfreemandyson better learn how to swim you fucking retard.","2015-12-28 06:15:13","4","[deleted]","1747845560.9513376","sea level projections","manual"

Could you tell me what the 'IPCC community' is, and who is in it? Could you also point to some evidence that members of that community think gases are grey bodies?","2015-12-28 12:18:02","3","nimbuscile","1747845560.9513376","sea level projections","manual"
