In 2017 global carbon emissions topped 38 million tons of [carbon](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-global-co2-emissions-set-to-rise-2-percent-in-2017-following-three-year-plateau), a 2% increase from the year previous and. 2017's carbon emissions will cause $7.2 trillion of harm of harm to the global economy and it seems more and more unlikely that the political will can be mustered to substantially reduce carbon emissions. While carbon emissions disproportionately originate in wealthy nations, it is the developing world that will bear the most [severe ](https://eos.org/scientific-press/study-global-warming-hits-poorest-nations-hardest)consequences. In today's podcast episode, I will be discussing how some countries in the developing world are adapting to climate change. I will discuss the Cape Town water crisis, the impact of climate change on agriculture in Russia, and Bangladesh's management of cyclones and floods.

While most climate change models predict increased levels of precipitation, [most ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-what-climate-models-tell-us-about-future-rainfall)climate change models that by 2050, levels of rainfall in South Africa will decrease by around 25%. Capetown suffered from severe drought between 2015 and 2017, and by mid-2018 people became afraid that Cape Town would reach day zero, the point at which the municipal government would be forced to close the taps and force people to [queue ](https://physicsworld.com/a/cape-town-day-zero-water-crisis-due-to-migrating-moisture-corridor/)for water at public water stations. The city government was forced to resort to drastic measures, including banning the watering of lawns, creating a water use goal of only 13 [gallons ](http://time.com/cape-town-south-africa-water-crisis/)(one 90 second shower, and four toilet flushes) of water per day and automatically shut off water to households that used more than 93 gallons and a public relations campaign to not flush toilets after urination. The government was able to reduce water consumption by [50%](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/cape-town-running-out-of-water-drought-taps-shutoff-other-cities/), and solid rainfalls in 2018 ended the crisis. A wide swathe of the world is expected to see substantial drying over the next 50 years, including the Mediterranean region, Central America and the American West, and western Australia, and cities in these regions will have to adapt ""300 year"" droughts happening more and more often.

While climate change will make South Africa more inhospitable to humanity, the opposite is true in Russia. Climate change is expected to [increase ](https://www.climatechangepost.com/russia/climate-change/)temperatures by around 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) over the next 50 years and levels of precipitation are expected to increase by more than 25%. While higher temperatures and precipitation will allow the extension of agriculture northwards and [allow ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrei_Kirilenko2/publication/226981684_Climate_change_food_stress_and_security_in_Russia/links/09e41511126ddc89b9000000/Climate-change-food-stress-and-security-in-Russia.pdf)for a longer growing season, it is unclear what the impact of climate change will be in the log run. Agriculture in Russia is concentrated in southern Russia, where highly fertile Chernozerm black soils allow for some of the most productive soils in the world and most climate change models project reduced rainfall and increased [drought ](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00360.1)in this region. Russia in 2017 produced 86 million tons of wheat, making it the [3rd largest](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#rankings/countries_by_commodity) wheat-producer in the world. Russian wheat production increased by 76% over the last ten years, and in 2018 Russia became the largest wheat exporter in the world. Global warming will dramatically [reduce ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/1/014010/pdf)agricultural yields in much of the world. The only way to avoid catastrophic hunger is for countries such as Russia where climate change will improve agricultural potential to increase agricultural production.

While climate change has created opportunities in some countries, it poses an existential risk to others. Bangladesh has always suffered severe weather events. Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed 500,000 people, and Bangladesh has [suffered ](https://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/deadlyworld.asp)from seven of the ten deadliest cyclones in world history. Bangladesh suffers from deadly floods every year with one fifth of the country inundated every year. Flooding is [exacerbated ](https://qz.com/india/1432375/climate-change-may-force-200000-people-in-bangladesh-to-migrate/)by increased levels of rainfall and rising sea levels from global warming. Bangladesh has been able to dramatically reduce cyclone mortality thanks to the Cyclone Preparedness Program. The CPP is a volunteer force of [55,000 ](https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/press-releases/asia-pacific/bangladesh/ifrc-launches-emergency-appeal-to-aid-coastal-communities-in-bangladesh-affected-by-cyclone-roanu/)people that organizes educational campaigns and maintains shelters before cyclones, coordinates evacuation programs during cyclones, and provides first aid and rescue services after cyclones. Between 1991 and 2009 the government doubled the number of public cyclone shelters to 3,976. Bangladesh has suffered three Category 5 cyclones since 1970. Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed 500,000 people and Cyclone Gorky in 1991 killed 140,000 people, while Cyclone Sidr in 2007 killed only 3,000 [people](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/cyclone-sidr-bangladesh-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment-disaster-recovery-and). Bangladesh has been similarly proactive in dealing with floods. The government distributes millions of Water Purification Tablets, and Oral Rehydration Solution before floods. The government has subsidized the construction of [tubewells ](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-effective-systems-keep-diarrhoea-check-even-during-floods)to ensure access to clean water during floods, so as to minimize levels of cholera and other water-borne [illnesses](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-effective-systems-keep-diarrhoea-check-even-during-floods). Thanks to these pro-active actions, Bangladesh did not have a [single ](https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/2017/08/30/bangladesh-eliminates-post-flood-disease-deaths/)flood induced diarrhea death despite massive flooding in 2017.

In today's podcast episode, I have discussed how Capetown, Russia and South Africa have adapted to climate change. I often hear climate change described as an apocalypse that will destroy our ability to survive. The experience of the three countries in this podcast suggests it is possible to adapt to climate change. However, not all places have institutions as adaptive as those of South Africa and Bangladesh, and there are limits to human ingenuity. Unless political leaders in high carbon emitting countries figure out how to curb emissions, we may discover these limits with catastrophic consequences.

"b8xkdg","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of Collapse 2019 Q1","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for just over three years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.
