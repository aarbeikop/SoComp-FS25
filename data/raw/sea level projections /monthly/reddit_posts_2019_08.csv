---
Human-induced climate change is an existential risk to human civilisation: an adverse outcome that will either annihilate intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential, unless carbon emissions are rapidly reduced.

Special precautions that go well beyond conventional risk management practice are required if the increased likelihood of very large climate impacts — known as “fat tails” — are to be adequately dealt with. The potential consequences of these lower-probability, but higher-impact, events would be devastating for human societies.

The bulk of climate research has tended to underplay these risks, and exhibited a preference for conservative projections and scholarly reticence, although increasing numbers of scientists have spoken out in recent years on the dangers of such an approach. 

Climate policymaking and the public narrative are significantly informed by the important work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, IPCC reports also tend toward reticence and caution, erring on the side of “least drama”, and downplaying the more extreme and more damaging outcomes. Whilst this has been understandable historically, given the pressure exerted upon the IPCC by political and vested interests, it is now becoming dangerously misleading with the acceleration of climate impacts globally. What were lower-probability, higher-impact events are now becoming more likely. 

This is a particular concern with potential climatic tipping points — passing critical thresholds which result in step changes in the climate system — such as the polar ice sheets (and hence sea levels), and permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts of global warming are non-linear and difficult to model with current scientific knowledge. 

However the extreme risks to humanity which the tipping points represent, justify strong precautionary management. Under-reporting on these issues is irresponsible,  contributing to the failure of imagination that is occurring today in our understanding of, and response to, climate change. 

If climate policymaking is to be soundly based, a reframing of scientific research within an existential risk-management framework is now urgently required. This must be taken up not just in the work of the IPCC, but also in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations if we are to address the real climate challenge. 

**Current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required.**

It is going to be used. Collapse gets closer by the day, and even now research is being done into it's [dispersal] (https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/clrizu/america_finally_hits_the_panic_button_harvard/), [cost] (https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/11/calculating-solar-geoengineering-s-technical-costs), and [expected effects] (https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/files/sgrp/files/irvine_etal_ncc_solar_geoengineering.pdf). 

There was a Congressional [hearing] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxdT3cpTftw) about it in 2017. The (at the time) active CIA Director [discussed] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=736&v=uIQDqxl9FtM) it in 2016, and it was the subject of congressional reports as early as [2010] (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg53007/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg53007.pdf) and [2013] (https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41371.pdf), and as recently as [2017] (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4586/text?format=txt) and [2019] (https://eos.org/articles/congressional-hearing-considers-paths-forward-on-climate-change) (though this last one seems to have disappeared off of their website). Geoengineering [would] (https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/23/solar-geoengineering-could-be-remarkably-inexpensive-report) be extremely [cheap] (https://www.ethicsandinternationalaffairs.org/2017/costs-of-geoengineering/), and could basically be attempted by any major industrialized nation as things get desperate.

Every day, new [studies] (https://www.sciencealert.com/harvard-scientists-say-reflecting-the-sun-could-safely-halve-temperature-increases) and [articles] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0398-8) are published [highlighting] (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17449626.2018.1552180?journalCode=rjge20) the [benefits] (https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/publications/solar-geoengineering-could-substantially-reduce-climate-risks-%E2%80%94-research-hypothesis) of geoengineering while downplaying the consequences.

The point here, ladies and gentlemen, is that the governments of the world have been aware of this for a long time. We often wonder, here on r/collapse, why it seems no one in power is doing anything, or even acknowledges the problem. This is why. 
Because geoengineering is, and has always been, the plan. 

>*“Unfortunately, climate change is dire enough for us to have to consider drastic action,” said Dr. Matthew Watson at the University of Bristol. “Some argue against researching these ideas but personally I think that is a mistake. There may come a time, in a future not so far away, where it would be immoral not to intervene.”*

**Why This Is A Bad Thing**

Cooling the planet sounds like a good thing, right? And on it's own, it is. The problem is what else it will do. 

It should go without saying, but every single report and prediction that cast geoengineering in a positive light are based on computer modeling and projections. We've seen how accurate those are with [permafrost] (https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/18/arctic-permafrost-canada-science-climate-crisis), [sea levels] (https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/444879-sea-levels-could-rise-faster-than-expected-swamping-coastal-cities), and [warming] (https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48964736) in general. Relying on these models, which are clearly incomplete, to predict the long-term or side effects of geoengineering is frankly ridiculous. But don't just take my word for it. 

>*""Most of the information on solar radiation management is from models and computer simulations. The actual results may differ from the predicted effect. The full effects of various solar radiation management proposals are not yet well understood. It may be difficult to predict the ultimate effects of projects, with models presently giving varying results.""* [Source] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management#Control_and_predictability)

And again.

>*""There is very high scientific uncertainty on the potential impacts of solar radiation management, and these cannot be resolved by field experiments. Most studies of solar radiation management are based on highly idealised scenarios and assumptions that differ substantially from discussed, real-world applications of solar radiation management. Results of idealised experiments should not be conflated with discussions around solar radiation management ‘solutions’ based on very different techniques.""* [Source] (https://climateanalytics.org/media/climateanalytics_srm_brief_dec_2018.pdf) 

It is very clear that they do not actually know what it will do, despite the optimistic projections. 

>*""The scientific modelling is still at a very early stage. Most studies are standalone in nature and by a limited number of scientists, based on highly idealised scenarios reducing the incoming solar radiation. For more complex experiments (such as with sulfate included) only a few studies based on individual models are available in the literature. Those that are available show a much higher inter-model uncertainty related to aerosol injection than for the highly idealised solar radiation experiment. This is in line with the state of the science as reported in the IPCC AR5 that there are still very large uncertainties in atmospheric chemistry in relation to aerosols. Furthermore, there may be very different circulation responses to aerosol injection and total solar irradiance.""* [Source] (https://climateanalytics.org/media/climateanalytics_srm_brief_dec_2018.pdf) 

But what about effects that they know for certain will happen?

**Side Effects**

>*""There may be unintended climatic consequences of solar radiation management that might not be predicted by the models used to plan them. Such effects may be cumulative or chaotic in nature.""* [Source] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management#Side_effects)

* Disruptions to the hydrologic cycle

It is [agreed] (https://www.llnl.gov/news/geoengineering-could-slow-down-global-water-cycle) upon [by] (https://www.pnas.org/content/105/22/7664.short) many [sources] (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgrd.50868) that [geoengineering] (http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/shs/Climatechange/Climate%20model%20results/Hydrological%20response.pdf) will [disrupt] (https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/files/tkg/files/kravitz_et_al._-_2014_-_a_multi-model_assessment_of_regional_climate_dispa.pdf) the water cycle of the [planet] (http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockStratAerosolGeo.pdf). The [water cycle] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle) is very important to life on earth. While the predicted effect is not too extreme, around 5-10% depletion in total rainfall per continent and a delaying of monsoon seasons, consider that these projections are made using the same models, and the same simplified and idealized scenarios, as described earlier. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management#cite_ref-Keith_Bower_2006,_pp._328_22-1)

It could also cause an uneven distribution in rainfall, resulting in, for instance, increased rainfall in one region and droughts in another. [Source] (https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2017/11/geoengineering-could-have-devastating-side-effects-study-warns/)

*  No effect to CO2 levels, reduction in sunlight

Because geoengineering does nothing to affect CO2 content in the air, levels of CO2 can be expected to not only be unaffected, but continue to increase. Thus, every CO2 related side effect other than heat trapping will persist in a geoengineered world. [Source] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management#Incomplete_solution_to_CO2_emissions)

This includes potentially severe [deficiencies] (https://phys.org/news/2019-07-nutrient-deficiencies-rice-grown-higher.html) in [nutrients] (https://www.ifpri.org/news-release/rising-co2-climate-change-projected-reduce-availability-nutrients-worldwide) in crops grown around the world, [ocean acidification] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification), and potential effects on human health and cognition. It will also have a negative effect on the growth of agriculture and plant life in general due to less sunlight reaching the surface of the earth. [Source] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089909) In addition, it would affect solar panel power output for the same reason. [Source] (https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JAMC-D-16-0298.1)

* Thermohaline circulation

Geoengineering may have [no effect] (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL064314) on ocean temperature. The [consequences] (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/research-highlight-loss-arctics-reflective-sea-ice-will-advance-global-warming-25-years) of a [warming ocean] (https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/clz6it/are_the_melting_ice_caps_and_glaciers_causing_any/evz1dd3/) are [devastating] (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/scientific-experts-call-for-eight-urgent-measures-to-preserve-life-supporting-ocean-function-amid-fears-that-changes-could-be-irreversible). 

* Ozone Depletion

[Many] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC122395/) studies [show] (https://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/10823/EGU2008-A-10823.pdf) that sulfate aerosols commonly proposed for use in geoengineering [could] (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045108) significantly [deplete] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18436741) the ozone layer. The [ozone layer] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer) is vital for life on earth. 

* Acid rain and other human health problems

Sulfate aerosols commonly proposed for use in engineering [cause] (https://web.archive.org/web/20070730012326/http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/PASScriptaVaria106.pdf) acid rain and other human health problems, such as lung cancer, acute respiratory infections,  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

So we've covered the complete lack of understanding and predictability, as well as the guaranteed side effects. Ready for the best part? 

**Termination Shock**

>*""If solar radiation management were masking a significant amount of warming and then were to abruptly stop, the climate would rapidly warm. This would cause a sudden rise in global temperatures towards levels which would have existed without the use of the climate engineering technique.""* [Source] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management#Termination_shock)

That's right, once we start [we] (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/2/024005/pdf) can't [stop] (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045103). 

**Conclusion**

Geoengineering may very well create a world worse than the problem it is trying to fix. It's an unproven and virtually untested technology, that when started cannot be stopped no matter what, that's main effects are uncertain to work as intended and that's known and unknown side effects are potentially catastrophic. We should all be terrified. 

A world in which geoengineering is deployed cannot be planned for. No one, from the most educated scientists to the average layman, can truly predict the potential for devastation and catastrophe. If your collapse plan is anything besides a gun and one bullet, all I can say is good luck. We're going to need it.

I'm honestly terrified by those, since it means that the warming will accelerate to points where any effort to lower or mitigate it will be impossible and that there is no hope anymore.


Even the cloud loss scares me, if it's as bad as people say it is.

This has led by to give in and accept that all of us are going to look forward to a future similar to ""The Road"" in or lifetime and we will experience it. I mean many of us have a lifespan that goes as far as the 2080's.

Though then again someone here said that those lops were debunked and disproven. 


/u/ClimateNurse had this to say about them:


- Not exactly. Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.


For the methane hydrates/methane bomb shebang...In Svalbard, where there is a particularly notable clathrate eruption and bubbling, was discovered to be happening for at least 8000 years, and erupted likely due to water depth changes, as it is on a continental slope.


More than likely this is one of the few events where this can occur, as methane hydrates must be under high pressure at high depths, where warning from the sea floor, which is dramatically colder than the air, must reach it to destabilize it. On top of that, even in shallow areas, fluctuations in temperature have not destabilized them. Even should they be destabilized (which would take a long, long while), Shakova et al., the team where the methane bomb theory originated, found that much of it went directly into the water and dissolved. Given this, methane releases would be small, given it is [quite soluble already in water, and research by Shakova & more backs this up.] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017RvGeo..55..126R) The methane bomb theory was aided by the team extrapolating how much methane release was there due to it dissolving, therefore spawning an inaccurate number of how much methane is actually venting from there. (Plus, it's hard to concentrate and find out how much)


A 15 Gt burst (1% of permafrost in nothing but methane. This... Isn't plausible one bit) (the 50 Gt burst is described in Edit 2) would give us a heating of 1C for a short duration, 0.4C in long-term. Various scientists such as Gavin Schmidt, cast doubt on this quite frequently, saying it is incredibly unlikely. For actual permafrost, we can likely expect some variation. .5C under high emissions scenarios (closer to RCP 8.5), with some saying a bit lower, or around .3-.4C at the same time. The same study just linked also says under low emissions scenarios we'd expect .15C but due to various melt collapses (thermokarsts), this is up for debate. But thermokarst studies predicts less by 2100, under high emission scenarios, yet others predict (only for low emission scenarios) double the warming, making it closer to .3C.


Due to arctic sea ice loss already, we've been facing .11C extra of heating, or .2 W/m^-2.


If we lose summer arctic sea ice, we can face an estimated .16C, or .3 W/m^-2.


If it is furthered in extent (year round), we are expected to get .35C total (counting the .11C we are already facing). This is where things get...Tricky.


So, cloud albedo plays a role in negating warming- but how much, we don't know. Sea ice loss increases cloud cover by 81% over these areas consistently, potentially reducing the feedback (and being 2-3x better than sea ice).It may also provide negligible reduction, or be a positive feedback. There's a lot of variability here, but it isn't going to be a big mass heating in an instant. It'd be gradual as the ice goes away more and more, particularly as we get closer to an ice-free arctic.


For it to happen -this- year, well...We'd have to see a graph like this. Which is very, very, very unlikely. We'll probably track closer to 2012 this year, and for the next...Who knows? There is a -lot- of variabiliy with it.


- The aerosol masking effect is a big cluster of a...Mess, really.


Some predict .4C, but the most common one I see thrown around on Reddit is 1C, but people never seem to note that it is by 2100, and under a specific RCP scenario, rather than what is currently masked. A majority of models indicate lower levels, or around .5C. Various comments from climate scientists also say this.


However, aerosols aren't just black and white like most people say they are- and they're not all from fossil fuel emissions. Some are from agriculture, others from fires, others from fossil fuels (not counting the natural ones). Some also heat the world, rather than cool it, but the variety of places that they come from make it unlikely that we'll see them vanish rapidly.


- Not a good thing, for certain. But it wouldn't be an instant one either, as a reminder.


Dieback (which would happen at ~+3-5°C anyway), would happen over decades (if not longer), but this isn't accounting for deforestation in addition to this. It's important to realize it wouldn't just explode out a lot of carbon!


Forest dieback is defined as trees losing health, and is the decline of a forest after a point has been reached. A lot can go into it, such as pests, disease, etc., but it's nonetheless a progressive or premature loss of trees. They can be in specific areas, elevations, perimeters, etc.


Likely, it would eventually become a net source rather than sink over time, as weve seen with other dying forests, then start to fade away into a Savannah, as predicted. CO2 release due to this would be gradual, rather than instant.


...But the capacity of it isn't nice.


Edit: I'm going to do some more research as OPs links say that it could produce 140 years of human emissions (sounds off to me, even if is from the rainforest trust. But there's a lot of factors at play so im gonna check what others say! I could be wrong.) Also, edited my figures.


PREPARE FOR MATH.


It turns out the Hothouse Earth paper covered this a little, too! (from 2018) So, this paper estimates by 2100 that the Amazon rainforest dieback will add .05°C, under 2C of warming. It has a range of .03-.11°C, BUT is based on extrapolations of observed changes in diebacks and model projections. The total CO2 estimate released by 2100 is also around 15-55 GtC.


2014 articles from Journal of Ecology (posting on mobile, reading on desktop, will post articles here eventually) and the sources used for the Hothouse Earth paper line up with this. So, this seems to support the idea that it will be VERY drawn out. The worst case scenarios run with 24-40% biomass shrinkage by 2100. (15-25 GtC).


I ran some conversions on the claims by rainforest trust as well, w/ 140 billion tons being 127 Gt. I'm...Confused but also bad at math, so someone correct me if I'm wrong here. For reference, humanity releases ~42 GtC per year. Their math lines up with the Hothouse Earth paper w/ how much carbon is stored (they estimated 150-200 GtC).


A rough calculation of GtC to ppm is about (from the IPCC)


1ppm CO2 = 2.12 GtC = 7.76 GtCO2.
So: 1GtCO2 = .127ppm CO2
1GtC = .47 ppm CO2.
1ppm = 0.0046875C.


We see about a 3ppm rise per year, but this also is on a delay. So even the warming released from this would be delayed for a LONG while. It'd add in the end about ~90+-5 ppm, so it'd be in the current roughly 31 years of human emissions by ppm per year, but a bit over 3 by our total emissions per year. (a lot of our emissions are absorbed by the ocean primarily!) This warming would be delayed by a good bit and vary in the end, as we also have a delay in our emissions (.2°C/decade), so this is a lot of complexity, and this also presumes it'd be instant release -and- all released.


So, if the Amazon were to poof and release all of its CO2, it'd end up warming us by around .45C! (used 95 ppm as a reference).


However, this assumes all of it would be in the atmosphere and not in the oceans/vegetation/etc. Humans still will release far more, nonetheless!


Nonetheless, the dieback would likely be due to the fact that the rainforest is a self sustaining system, and after a certain point it would probably start to struggle. Combine that with a changing climate and you've got this. It'd be over a long period, but be irreversible.

Okay, having to rewrite this as I closed the page clicking to a paper to link. Whoops.

To quickly summarize (by 2100)
Permafrost + Methane = .15-.5C (.5C being RCP 8.5, methane hydrates ignored because they're not quite a threat)
Forest fires (boreal forest) = .02-.10C
Amazon dieback realistically = .03-.11C
Land sink change = .13-.27C


https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/07/31/1810141115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1810141115.sapp.pdf


Carbon sinks also vary greatly depending on where they're at, what they are, how they'll be affected, what warming we'll hit, etc. So that is also too tricky to put into a singular post. The ocean is also one of our biggest carbon sinks, and absorbs a -lot-. Most of our emissions go into it, rather than vegetation.


I can't cover the carbon cycle much (if at all), as that's a bit out of my depth. I'll bug a climate scientist for sure, but I imagine it'd be similar to other feedbacks- over time, relatively small compared to human emissions.


- Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.


For the methane hydrates/methane bomb shebang...In Svalbard, where there is a particularly notable clathrate eruption and bubbling, was discovered to be happening for at least 8000 years, and erupted likely due to water depth changes, as it is on a continental slope.


More than likely this is one of the few events where this can occur, as methane hydrates must be under high pressure at high depths, where warning from the sea floor, which is dramatically colder than the air, must reach it to destabilize it. On top of that, even in shallow areas, fluctuations in temperature have not destabilized them. Even should they be destabilized (which would take a long, long while), Shakova et al., the team where the methane bomb theory originated, found that much of it went directly into the water and dissolved. Given this, methane releases would be small, given it is [quite soluble already in water, and research by Shakova & more backs this up.] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017RvGeo..55..126R) 


The methane bomb theory was aided by the team extrapolating how much methane release was there due to it dissolving, therefore spawning an inaccurate number of how much methane is actually venting from there. (Plus, it's hard to concentrate and find out how much)


A 15 Gt burst (1% of permafrost in nothing but methane. This... Isn't plausible one bit) (the 50 Gt burst is described in Edit 2) would give us a heating of 1C for a short duration, 0.4C in long-term. Various scientists such as Gavin Schmidt, cast doubt on this quite frequently, saying it is incredibly unlikely. For actual permafrost, we can likely expect some variation. .5C under high emissions scenarios (closer to RCP 8.5), with some saying a bit lower, or around .3-.4C at the same time. The same study just linked also says under low emissions scenarios we'd expect .15C but due to various melt collapses (thermokarsts), this is up for debate. But thermokarst studies predicts less by 2100, under high emission scenarios, yet others predict (only for low emission scenarios) double the warming, making it closer to .3C.


Due to arctic sea ice loss already, we've been facing .11C extra of heating, or .2 W/m^-2.


If we lose summer arctic sea ice, we can face an estimated .16C, or .3 W/m^-2.


If it is furthered in extent (year round), we are expected to get .35C total (counting the .11C we are already facing). This is where things get...Tricky.


So, cloud albedo plays a role in negating warming- but how much, we don't know. Sea ice loss increases cloud cover by 81% over these areas consistently, potentially reducing the feedback (and being 2-3x better than sea ice).It may also provide negligible reduction, or be a positive feedback. There's a lot of variability here, but it isn't going to be a big mass heating in an instant. It'd be gradual as the ice goes away more and more, particularly as we get closer to an ice-free arctic.


For it to happen -this- year, well...We'd have to see a graph like this. Which is very, very, very unlikely. We'll probably track closer to 2012 this year, and for the next...Who knows? There is a -lot- of variabiliy with it.


-  I've had the 1.6C claim thrown at me recently, so I was curious if it was from the same source. (It was from the temperature anomaly + estimated aerosol masking from the current date, though I've also had other baselines used, vs. what is commonly used- 1850-1900). The IPCC has gotten ice sheet melt wrong by a good measure, but observed warming has been incredibly accurate to date (with minor deviations above average). There's always going to be some deviation in predicted warming, which could also have added to this (they estimated .8C to 1.2C, with an average of 1C warming in the AR5 report.)


For temperatures to rise that high, we'd have to be far beyond...Well, any understandings of the climate, and forgo our observations to date (as our observations are very in-line with CMIP5 modeling), and presume that the climate ECS is far higher than what it is observed to be, or could be- even with the new model estimates.


For presuming averages, we have to take into account land & sea changes, and for the IPCC/Paris Agreement '1.5C', it must be an average of 1.5C over a certain period of time, rather than the average hitting this. (There's a lot of factors that go into consideration of the average, will dig it up when I can!) The average on some years -has- breached 1C repeatedly (the average from observations in 2017 was 1.2C!), but this was expected due to anomalies.



- A: GMOs can and will bridge the gap eventually.


B: Current biodiversity decline is largely due to horrible management of agriculture and pesticides. Those 2 stop we will see significant drops in species dying. Climate change is still an issue obviously but it's not the reasons species are rapidly dying. And just so you know *we are not in the 6th mass extinction*.



Not sure if i should feel better or event trust this at all. because me, like most people concerned about this believe we will see this on our lifetime, are depressed by it and feel hopeless about it. Thinking of the horrible deaths as well as the utter grief of seeing society collapse before our very eyes. Many of us are contemplating suicide even as they are unwilling to live long enough to see that happen.

Heck even much of us accepted and resigned that as the future as governments and corporations do nothing about it or oppose action against it in the face of activism and mounting public concern. Even the people guilty of inaction as they are unwilling to change their lifestyles or are unaware of the concern or even straight up deny  or dismiss it. either saying it wont affect them or having swallowed up the climate denial junk being generated by the right wing and the corporate propagandists. 

I dont know if if they are really as bad as what the articles, and people (including scientists) say but I feel that I will live to see the collapse of society and the extinction of Mankind within my lifetime or even earlier (either in the 2030s or even as early as the 2020s) thanks to the feedback loops. I'm even anticipating the Water Crisis (Nothing is being done to address the drying wells) as well as the collapse of the agricultural system and the famines it will produce thanks to bees going extinct and land becoming unusable as predicted in the IPCC report recently.


Given AR6 report is to be published this December 31st. I'm merely expecting more bad news or straight up ""The window has closed and any attempt now is impossible and the 2030 deadline has shortened"". Especially since this time around. Feedback loops will be taken into account. i can only imagine the disappointment these activists and all of us will have once its stated that it's either impossible at this point or it's too big to even handle anymore. The distraught and grief of them having to face a post apocalyptic world in their lifetime as there is nothing they can do anymore I hope we all accept what's coming and hope we at least die as swiftly, quietly, and as painlessly as possible. we al fear death dont we? And many of us fear a death from disease, starvation thirst and ehat stroke from this. or even getting killed by other survivors when society collapses. I'm even having nightmares of aimlessly wandering around a post apocalyptic world and then dying from hunger, thirst, and the intense heat from the  uncontrolled warming.

Those feedback loops don't make climate change like boiling a frog. It's more ike dying from a terminal sickness that rapidly gets faster.

Current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required

Human-induced climate change is an existential risk to human civilisation: an adverse outcome that will either annihilate intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential, unless carbon emissions are rapidly reduced.

Special precautions that go well beyond conventional risk management practice are required if the increased likelihood of very large climate impacts — known as “fat tails” — are to be adequately dealt with. The potential consequences of these lower-probability, but higher-impact, events would be devastating for human societies.

The bulk of climate research has tended to underplay these risks, and exhibited a preference for conservative projections and scholarly reticence, although increasing numbers of scientists have spoken out in recent years on the dangers of such an approach. 

Climate policymaking and the public narrative are significantly informed by the important work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, IPCC reports also tend toward reticence and caution, erring on the side of “least drama”, and downplaying the more extreme and more damaging outcomes. Whilst this has been understandable historically, given the pressure exerted upon the IPCC by political and vested interests, it is now becoming dangerously misleading with the acceleration of climate impacts globally. What were lower-probability, higher-impact events are now becoming more likely. 

This is a particular concern with potential climatic tipping points — passing critical thresholds which result in step changes in the climate system — such as the polar ice sheets (and hence sea levels), and permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts of global warming are non-linear and difficult to model with current scientific knowledge. 

However the extreme risks to humanity which the tipping points represent, justify strong precautionary management. Under-reporting on these issues is irresponsible,  contributing to the failure of imagination that is occurring today in our understanding of, and response to, climate change. 

If climate policymaking is to be soundly based, a reframing of scientific research within an existential risk-management framework is now urgently required. This must be taken up not just in the work of the IPCC, but also in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations if we are to address the real climate challenge.

What does that mean? Current focus is on the energy paradigm that got us into this mess, though that is the most important we will not get out of this mess by solving that component alone. Any and all solutions need to be explored and implemented with government funding equivalent to world war mobilization efforts. Taxation will have to increase substantially to compensate.

Efforts to focus on

* Water; Many areas need new and more robust flood management systems for wet seasons and water storage for dry seasons. Great projects possible, in great lakes, Mediterranean , and Arabic gulfs.  
* Re glacierization; Very important to reduce sea level rise. How can this be done? Solar shades. Develop a standardized design that can easily be mass produced. Roll out to international community. Geo stationary, or stationary at the L 1 point, to keep snow from thawing in summer. They will be an ever growing swarm having a growing effect as more are launched. Northern Canada, Greenland, Siberia, and Antarctica all target locations. Also possibility of small glacier growth in mountains using this method, and will restore water supply issues in some regions.
* Energy; Fission large scale, modular fusion, continued battery research. Focus already strongly  here.
* Food; Continued condensing required agricultural land. Indoor grow ops with increased food density and genetic/ selective breeding combo to increase yields. Diet change, switch to a more plant protein diet , Indian food is a great alternative. We need to step back our footprint on nature and this is an easy place to start.
* Bio; take some level of control and ownership over the environment. Instead of protecting, which is essentially just leaving areas alone, we should aid nature in finding a new normal. By Allowing invasive species, and aiding indigenous ones through genetic or selective breeding.  Fast growing trees should be planted on every unused hectare of land. 
* Space; Secondary business models need to be established to truly become space faring. Economic incentive must drive this next step.Moon asteroid impact exploration and surface asteroid mining and cataloging (current value of asteroids extremely high). Secondary moon profits from H 3 mining, then tourism. Lagrange point manufacturing point of interest for materials research as the unique gravitational and vacuum properties can allow for predictable, reliable process of crystallization (thinking super strong, super light metals). Inter asteroid belt water mining missions. Primary goal of space is to get all destructive process’ off plant, the growth of the race can only happen there, Earth must remain stagnant. 
* People value; It obvious to everyone by now that automation will strip the majority of jobs away, this is why there isn't a sub section dedicated to that subject. It will happen and people will have to find a new way to have value, let alone make money. Money is easy just give everyone a set amount. But humans are hierarchical animals when left to their own devices inequalities appear from our own constructs. These inequalities can be good or bad, to avoid the possibility of bad ones we can set up a social reward system for contributing to society, science, or industry in a positive way, must be open and transparent. Hybrid system likely a good stepping stone.
* Education; obviously will be controversial but i'd like to see an AI driven classroom where every child will have a personal desktop AI to give them one on one time that can adapt to and focus a child's mind in between teachers lessons. Priming children to leverage the power of AI needs to be the new focus of education of else we will be left behind.
* AI symbiosis; Eventual merge with AI through brain implants, neural lace. This will be a new form of human condition yet to be explored, but a better option than to be at the will of AI.
* Population reduction; During this massive re mobilization of the global economy, developed countries should reject any and all immigration from countries that have a net positive population growth. We must embrace the population downturn, and leverage automation gains to benefit everyone equally. Build up then pop down. Even if we do all that to push climate change back it will still be too little, if so, the last possible resort should be a mass suicide calculate an ideal population number that will buy us enough time to stabilize the environment over the long term. 

Warnings;

* Technological Ultra high speed war, driven by very fast missile that can defeat missile shields. With armed drone swarms that can quickly fly, identify, and kill targets with cold efficiency of machine logical. Using personal data to categories people as potential future threats and facial recognition technology to identify those people accurately. This method of warfare would be as effective as nuclear war but with no environmental repercussions, all enemy assets remain. 
* With the availability of genetic modification technology and the future trending it to become more available. There is a real risk of engineered super bugs wiping out humanity. Mental health options should be available to everyone.
