"cp66zvv","t3_2y4ph4","2y4ph4","science","scientific","I've been struggling with this disease for roughly 2 years now and it's been a nightmare to say the least. I've been in and out of hospital emergency rooms, been to at least 12 different doctors, been shuffled from one place to another and no one had a clue what was going on. I've been put in a mental facility and shipped off to a mood disorder rehab facility before finally someone believed me. I know what it's like to suffer and have your doctors call you an enigma. It's not easy and it's not fun. Not the life that any of us want. 

There is no funding in CFS (Only $5m annually for a disease that effects an estimated 1,000,000 people compared to $3bn annually for HIV/AIDS) and seems to be a real lack of incentive for researchers to delve into this field. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for putting the effort and work you do into helping people that can't help themselves. It really does mean the world that people care and want to help. 

With the research you and your colleagues have presented, you've shown elevated inflammatory cytokines specifically early on in the illness. There has to be a cause for this and from what I've read you brought up the possibility of a virus (of which I still have an active EBV 2 years on!) or bacteria, etc. **Is studying the relationship of mycotoxins in the body as a potential trigger on the agenda and are you familiar with the work of Dr. David Strauss of Texas Tech University on the involvement of mycotoxins in illness?**

Once again thank you for your hard work and I hope to see it replicated so that we patients can have something to objectively show the nay-sayers. Pass along my dearest thanks to your colleagues as well, many I've heard of and many I haven't!

1) What is the current status of the CFS/ME microbe study?

2) Because the crowd funding study only raised about $220k, how will you and Dr. Ian Lipkin obtain the remainder of the funding necessary to complete the study?

3) CFS/ME expert, Dr. De Meirleir, has found temporary positive effects of fecal transplants on CFS/ME patients. But he believes the transplants are not treating the core pathology and that bad flora regrows in patients over time. Hypothetically, if the microbe study is able to identify a pathogen as the culprit for a majority of CFS/ME patients, why haven’t current treatments such as probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplants shown to be more effective managing the disease?

"cp6clca","t3_2y4ph4","2y4ph4","science","scientific","There is a tremendous amount of stigma against mental illness in the ME community. Some patients accused of being ""merely"" depressed argue that not only are they not depressed, they have a ""real,"" ""physical"" disease. The implication being that patients with a mental illness do not.

This view is unsurprising given the history of the promotion of behavioral interventions to the exclusion of other treatment paradigms. Many doctors meanwhile dismiss ME patients as having a psychiatric illness. Some believe that patients cling to an ME or CFS diagnosis because they do not want to accept that their illness is actually psychiatric or psychosomatic. 

My view is that diseases like major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc. are ""physical"" conditions just as autism, parkinson's, alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, etc. And I wonder sometimes if we classify diseases as ""real"" or not, ""psychiatric"" or not based not on their possible pathophysiology but rather on the patient's behavior and how it makes us, the observer, feel.

ME is very clearly not depression nor is it any of the diseases I just mentioned. Yet I am uncomfortable with the way some patients and doctors attempt to draw the boundaries between what is and is not a legitimate disease. As patients, our reaction to being stigmatized is sometimes to stigmatize others.

What in your mind is the distinction between a psychiatric and a neurological illness? How is that distinction parsed in medicine v. in scientific research? What do you think people mean when classify a disease as ""real"" or ""not real?"" (Especially in light of what we now know about the possible role of infection, immunity, and comorbidities in some of the conditions I mentioned above.)

EDIT: It seems my read on the stigma differs from most everyone else. Many I am being overly sensitive to others' use of language. I also think some of it may have to do with my position in the community – I receive so many message and so see the best and the worst and everything in between. I am very glad stigma against mental illness does not appear to be a common experience.

She's had a couple more since then, not as protracted but still up to 2 years, and is currently nearly a year into a current episode.  Since you know what effect this disease has on a life, you know how devastating it has been for her--close to a third of her life, gone.

She exhausted all the healthcare options available to her long before I met her (two years ago).  To me, it seems utterly hopeless.  I didn't fully understand until it came into both our lives.  My only quesiton for you is: what can we do?  Where can she go, right now, to have the best chance at some sort of treatment which can get her back to living something of a normal life?

"cp67g3n","t3_2y4ph4","2y4ph4","science","scientific","Hi Prof. Hornig. Thank you for doing this AMA. I have a couple of questions:
1) From your article in Science Advances it would seem to me that you are proposing to perform cytokine analysis as a diagnostic tool for ME/CFS? Given the role of cytokines in many other disease, in what way could this be tailored for ME/CFS? 
2) What are the proposed mechanisms/triggers for ME/CFS? Is there a reason as to why the cytokine profile is different in patients with ME/CFS compared to controls? 
3) From your other studies you also seem to have a keen interest in postnatal development of the central nervous system. It is known that the neuro-immune axis undergoes prolonged maturation, and the cytokine profiles are different between young children and adults (pre-clinical studies suggest the neuroimmune system switches from being predominantly anti-inflammation to pro-inflammatory at around puberty). Just out of interest, what do you think about performing a longitudinal study involving children who had significant trauma in early life, and see how many of them develop ME/CFS later in life?
Thank you for your time.","2015-03-06 13:22:34","8","slittyeyes","1747837971.4718943","sea level projections","manual"
"cp6aizt","t3_2y4ph4","2y4ph4","science","scientific","After lurking for many years, I'm creating an account to comment.

&nbsp;


I've been sick for a little over 20 years. CFS hit me in college. It was catastrophic. Years later, when I got pregnant, I went into remission. Each pregnancy put me into remission. The first time I assumed it was because CFS is probably autoimmune and those illnesses can go into remission during pregnancy. After the second pregnancy my doctor and I tried various hormones. I now take 600mg progesterone a night, and it makes a dramatic difference.

&nbsp;


**1**  Do you have any idea why progesterone helps, or why pregnancy helped? 

&nbsp;


**2** Do you think the three year mark changing the cytokine levels is related to the anecdotal truism that while some people spontaneously get well, none do after three years?

&nbsp;


**3** Thank you so much for your work. We feel so invisible sometimes. 

&nbsp;


For fellow sufferers, these are things that help me:

&nbsp;


**Moderation:** cutting waayyyy back on what I do. You know this one. But it's really important to stop before you feel ill, because the repercussions don't usually kick in until the next day. You probably know this too, but it's crucial.  And I need much more sleep than healthy people.

&nbsp;


**Magnesium:** After I'd been sick for 8 years, a doctor tested the mineral levels in my blood cells, not my blood serum. Different test. Serum levels were normal but the other test showed the minerals weren't making it into the cells. I really, really low on magnesium in particular. I was given several IV infusions. It raised my base energy levels a few notches. I was retested years later but was still fine, so it was a one tie treatment.

&nbsp;


**Progesterone:** I take 600 mg progesterone/day. Obviously this is not a standard treatment. My progesterone levels while not treated were low when we tested them (2 at the point in my cycle that should be highest) but the endocrinologist told me that he couldn't really act on that because normal levels are 0-20. Which brings into question, why test at all then? But that's a different question. I started at 300mg, and have slowly raised it. Each additional 100mg helps a bit, but 600 is the most my doc is comfortable with. Plus it gets more expensive. 

&nbsp;


**Steroids:** When I'm in a relapse I take a 7 day pack of methylprednisolone (a steroid). It usually helps, but not if I'm really in a bad way. Steroids are not something to mess around with, and I'm only allowed to take them 3 months apart or longer. 

&nbsp;


**Palliatives:** I take vicodin sometimes.  I take muscle relaxants after unusual exertion. My muscles tend to lock up and to twitch, and the locking up is related to the pain I feel afterward, and this helps a little.  

&nbsp;


**Foods:** Like another poster, apparently I became sensitive to some foods once I got ill. I resisted food elimination diets for  years partly because I have no gut symptoms, but it turns out that gluten really hurts me. I know, it's so trendy, but there it is. Post gluten I feel like I have the flu (including a slightly raised temp) every afternoon for several weeks. I have igG antibodies to gluten. I lived with the flu thing for almost 20 years before I figured out the gluten thing. I can still get the flu feeling by overdoing but it's not daily now. And it must be connected to the CFS - the gluten issues went away while pregnant, too.","2015-03-06 15:24:36","6","cfs20years","1747837971.4768941","sea level projections","manual"

Thank you so much for all your effort in research and doing this AMA.

My questions are:

Will any research be done on how to identify and treat the group of people with +3 years of the disease?

Have any studies been done on how Idiopathic Hypersomnia treatments work on those who suffer greatly from unrestful or restless sleep?  I'm prescribed Nuvigil for this symptom and it helps me overcome a bulk of my fatigue. I've also found that for flair ups, Ambiem helps me feel more rested which contributes to feeling better the next day.  Is there any work being done to get these kinds of medications approved for CFS/ME/SEID sufferers so we aren't going without since insurance still doesn't recognize it as treatment for this disease (or even as a disease)?

My question is what role you think the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have in this disease. Based on my experience, the theory that dysfunction in these systems are central to the disease really resonates with me. It seems to explain the (out of character) high anxiety levels that appear with the onset of fatigue and PEM symptoms, the disturbed sleep patterns, and possibly the over-drive immune response...

However, if we were to do something more like P (You have ME | Test A, Test B, Test C), we could probably already get to 99%.

Why is it that we need a single biomarker? Rather thank looking for that elusive single test, might it not make sense to determine the most efficient and practical panel from among existing tests (CPET, NK function, tilt table, viral antibody titers, cytokines, etc.)? Where does the obsession with a single test come from? What about other diseases for which there is not a single diagnostic test?

The fact is that we're just animals who evolved to fit an environment which we no longer live in. When we over-exploit resources, we're simply following a million years of instincts that kept our ancestors alive and breeding.

It's impossible or wrong to blame a toddler who gets hold of a handgun for shooting up the house. In the same way, we may be the authors of our own destruction, but it was both inevitable and the result of a natural process, our own evolution.

The only way that this could have been avoided is either meddling with our genetic structure to edit out harmful instincts, or put us under the direct control of something without those instincts. ","2015-03-28 20:43:24","16","stumo","1747838298.1653662","sea level projections","manual"

Internet service was down for the last four days so I was doing some reading, “Mapping the Mind” by Rita Carter. I found this passage on p.42 to be in agreement with our conclusions: 

>“Our urge to rationalize behavior probably has considerable survival value. The human species got where it is largely by forming complex social constructs – from the hunting party to the political party – and making them work. To work they require that we have confidence in them and to have confidence we need to believe that the actions of these organizations are based on sound, rational judgements. At one level, of course, we know we are kidding ourselves. For example, all governments, in all societies, have some policies that are demonstrably irrational. However, no government member, anywhere, ever admits this – not at the time, anyway. Instead they rationalize their policy-making. We may see through it, but basically we like things this way – it makes us feel safe.”

So basically what we have is a subconsciously directed Homo erectus fossil fuel hunting party with the added capabilities of technology, without willfulness, with a wordsmithing module that tells us we’re doing the right thing and that God loves capitalism, F-150 trucks, war heroes, Coca-Cola, that humans are special, growth is good and that the technological singularity is just beyond the horizon.
