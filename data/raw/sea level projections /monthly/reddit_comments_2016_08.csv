"d6joect","t3_4xz8gv","4xz8gv","collapse","skeptical",">basically, the quality of climate change that prevents mass extinction from happening is **slow shifts in climate**. we're already shifting it what looks like to be ~10x faster that what plants/animals could do to keep up. heck, we probably won't need that full 8-10C to cause mass extinction, we might be shifting it fast enough with just 2-3C that the environment is already completely boned. and **there is zero hope of this really slowing anytime soon**, these are decadal averages, it's probably worse this year.


You're very much correct. The fact that the climate is changing isn't really the problem - it is in fact the *rate of change* that is the real killer. 

>many ecosystems probably have little room to shift because of human activity, and will likely just die.

In reality, almost all major ecosystems on the planet are currently either collapsing or collapsed. We've taken all the best land and fragmented what's left. We take all the available biological energy and nutrients that we can. Hell, there are more than 57,000 large dams worldwide, eliminating normal nutrient flows and destroying aquatic ecosystems. There isn't really any hope for most areas. All the 'canaries' in our global coal mine are dead or about to die.","2016-08-16 13:56:40","24","xenago","1747853081.4979074","sea level projections","manual"

I do not trust loosely cited arguments, miss a couple of details and your whole argument could be completely wrong. Here I've seen a graph, and an excerpt. I've got plenty of information on how you _feel_ about the subject, but that just seems off topic to me. Where is the info on CO2 stacking? Where is the info on heat sinks other than oceans (and also oceans)? On 100ppm having its full thermal effect? On error bounds? You have all this in front of you to answer, but you still chose to begin a paragraph with ""the only question that remains to me""... You claim to be far from having all the answers, but you're still drawing conclusions as if you do. 
The answers to the questions you ask are included in your premise. You are begging the question, and it's a logical fallacy.","2016-08-16 18:19:27","8","BrilliantShot","1747853081.501911","sea level projections","manual"
"d6kb4pq","t3_4xz8gv","4xz8gv","collapse","skeptical","Doesn't take into account polar heat acceleration and amplified jet streams for the northern hemisphere. This will combine with the fact that fresh glacial melt water sends warm salt water to undermine glacial grounding lines, which will create more extreme storms in temperate and tropical zones. 

Mass extinction has until recently been driven more by humans and livestock numbers, climate is a new multiplier.

There are 20+ climate feedbacks, each accelerating exponentially until feedbacks outnumber human emissions, which will remain substantial, until we run out of water and food due to rain/drought continental extremes and flooding of coasts. The tropical refugee surge is about to become a tsunami as rain forests burn.

Everything shown in this thread displays why the earth is pretty much dead. The temperatures are rising too fast and have triggered all the feedback loops.

"d6k6qch","t3_4xz8gv","4xz8gv","collapse","skeptical","On the one hand we have thousands of people with advanced degrees in fields like climatology and atmospheric chemistry who have come to consensus on certain aspects of global warming, then we have people who aren't scientists challenging those things based on some graphs or blog posts they read.  It's like somebody arguing with an accepted theory in marine biology based on an idea they got from watching shark week on the discovery channel.  Some of it is global warming denial, some if it is exaggerating or sensationalizing global warming.  It's all ridiculous.  

I think scientists tend to ignore popular theories that are born out of ignorance and lack basic scientific credibility.  It's just not really their job to go around refuting every wild goofball theory every day.  The problem is that, as a result, a lot of these ideas end up lingering and festering and people latch on to them because they are more dramatic and sexy than current scientific projections.

"d6kcx58","t3_4xz8gv","4xz8gv","collapse","skeptical","Excellent rant... All that has occurred in the past can be quantified and qualified in accessible data. A study of what has happened, that agrees with previous studies, is plain for all to see. 

On the other hand, predicting what comes next must be approached with great caution. Turn of the century predictions were all over the place when it comes to what we see today. But non-hysterical, science based predictions turned out to be way too conservative. Here in 2016, the predictions for 2030 are again all over the place. But respected scientists, as conservative as many of their projections may be, are joined by more and more of their peers who are not nearly as optimistic. I can understand why some smart people on this board move toward the more apocalyptic scenarios. 

For me, I always think about the ways that we humans will deal with a crisis--the ultimate crisis. What I sometimes fear most is the way that we humans deal with this human-caused calamity. It seems that our actions could very well cause far more suffering and death (all species, not just our precious selves), especially with sociopaths calling the shots.
