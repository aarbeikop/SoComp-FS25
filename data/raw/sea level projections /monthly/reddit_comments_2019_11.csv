First of all the Antarctic ice has been growing for several years. Only the artic glaciers and icebergs are melting. Also there is no reliability in the satellite data of sea level rise from NOAA. The satellite they use has a minimum resolution of 25 mm.  They saying they are measuring a 3 mm/yr rise by measuring one area every 10 days. There is no reliability in their data.  When measuring below 50% of minimum resolution. At 50% the reliability is 90% and drops exponentially so at 10% there is almost zero reliability. The tide gauges tell the truth but NOAA does not use them because they show no sea level rise. Thomas Wysmuller received a standing ovation at a climate change conference where he showed the data which proves no sea level rise. Also you were lied to about 40 inch rise by 2300. Even at 3mm/yr since 1950 would be 17 inches. Not 40. Since 1950 there is 8 inches according to the false data at NOAA.

Also have you ever read an IPCC report? You have been lied to by the IPCC. Cctruth.org/ipcc.pdf","2019-11-19 21:43:27","0","cctruth","1747888411.1149533","sea level projections","manual"
