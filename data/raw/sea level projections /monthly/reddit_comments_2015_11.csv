Thank you for taking the time to do an AMA. I am interested in taking the other side of the debate, since I believe LISS and HIIT of are equal importance to improving health.

>The mitochondrial ROS production was mea-
sured with the fluorescent indicator MitoSOX Red in single FDB

a running wheel in the cage. The lat

endurance training by running
∼
20 km each night for 40 d (

). The isolated fibers were activated with elec-
trical current pulses and a stimulation scheme mimicking the acti-
vation pattern during the all-out cycling bouts (six 30-s periods of
250 ms tetanic 100-Hz stimulation given every 500 ms with 4 min of
rest between the stimulation periods). At 5 and 10 min after the
simulated HIIT exercise, the MitoSOX Red fluorescence was in-
creased by
∼
200% in the sedentary control mice, whereas the in-
crease was significantly smaller (by
∼
80%) in the endurance-trained
mice

Do you think this and your findings that elite endurance athletes didn't have the same RyR1 fragmentation support that LISS can result in similar adaptations to HIIT?

In addition, what is the amount of antioxidants needed to take to simulate your 20mM concentration? assuming an extracellular fluid volume of 16L (12L interstitial + 4 L plasma), this would mean one would need to take **[87 of these NAC pills](http://www.amazon.com/Foods-Nac-Acetyl-Cysteine-600mg-Vcaps/dp/B0013OUQ3S)**, and assuming 10% bioavailability, more like 870 pills to achieve the same antioxidant concentration you exposed muscle to. **Did you do a lower concentration, and find that it had a lower effect?

"cwrv6wk","t3_3rvtqe","3rvtqe","science","scientific","In the abstract it states the following:

>recreationally active human subjects performed highly demanding HIIT consisting of 30-s bouts of all-out cycling with 4-min rest in between bouts (≤3 min total exercise time). Skeletal muscle biopsies taken 24 h after the HIIT exercise showed an extensive fragmentation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channel, the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). The HIIT exercise also caused a prolonged force depression and triggered major changes in the expression of genes related to endurance exercise. Subsequent experiments on elite endurance athletes performing the same HIIT exercise showed no RyR1 fragmentation or prolonged changes in the expression of endurance-related genes.

Don't you think this is more related to the fact that elite endurance athletes have already achieved the majority of the benefits they can get from 30 second high-effort bouts on an exercise bike with 4 minutes of rest inbetween? I've never met an elite endurance athlete that *hasn't* been doing interval workouts for years, *in addition* to lower-intensity aerobic efforts, higher-intensity tempo efforts, etc., a la [Jack Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_%28coach%29#Training_philosophy). It seems to me it's more likely than that they're simply at a performance level that can't be improved by *this particular interval workout*, or else elite endurance athletes all around the world wouldn't bother incorporating interval workouts into their training, which we both know is wrong.

It seems more to me like this study suggests that in under/averagely trained individuals, 30 second high-effort exercise bouts show more muscular improvements than those same bouts do in very elite individuals. Because the elite individuals have already gained all the muscular benefits they can achieve through such a workout, so they need to incorporate interval work differently, which they've been doing for years.","2015-11-07 16:01:23","3","Eibhlin_Andronicus","1747844866.530527","sea level projections","manual"

My question is about calories in vs calories out. It's always frustrated me when people put down the obese by saying, ""It's just a simple matter of burning more calories than you eat!"" It's never been that simple for me.  Calories are these weird, arbitrary numbers that have to do with heating water, right?

"cxa92rv","t3_3txns6","3txns6","science","scientific","*Your study focused on glucose response. But glucose response is not always proportional to insulin response. It's highly disproportionate with high-fat and high-protein foods. Proteins and fats elicit nearly as much or even moreso insulin than do unrefined carbs. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/66/5/1264.full.pdf 

From your paper:
> with regard to PPGRs, approaches that grade dietary ingredients as universally “good” or “bad” based on their average PPGR in the population may have limited utility for an individual

Do you think you should clarify for the public that glucose response is not always proportional to insulin response? You're promoting the idea that people should fit their diets to their glucose response but glucose response is only half the story. 

*Are you going to share the data? I'd like to see the results for specific foods or at least macronutrients. 

*I read on a news release of this paper that a banana had two opposite results on two different people. Will you comment on the implications of that? Specifically, does it mean that one person with a negative reaction should avoid that food altogether or perhaps ween themselves onto it until their body has an appropriate reaction? 

*Are you familiar with Dr. Neal Barnard's work on diabetes? Is there a contradiction between his findings that diabetes type II is reversed on a low-fat, low-protein whole-food plant-based diet and your findings? Again, specific data would clear the air here. 

*It is true that increased glucose response is linked with diabetes type II. However, is the problem with glucose or insulin? A proposed mechanism, by the same doctors who reported clinical reversal of diabetes, suggests that fat blocks insulin from entering the cells to appropriately respond to glucose. Are you familiar with this mechanism and how does this relate to your findings? 

*Suggesting that no one diet is for everyone is very bold. This has the potential to be a dangerous rationalization for a bad diet. It would be great if you could be transparent with your data so the public can see for themselves how exactly one should fit a diet to one's self. Without a mention of at least macronutrients, I'm afraid your results are useless to me, as a reader. Does ""no one diet fits all"" mean that I should eat 90% carbs while my neighbor should eat 90% fat? Or is it a smaller difference, say I should eat 90% carbs and my neighbor should eat 85%? Or are macronutrients less important and it's the type of food that matters? 

*Your paper states:

>Factors that may affect interpersonal differences in PPGRs include genetics (Carpenter et al., 2015), lifestyle (Dunstan et al., 2012), insulin sensitivity (Himsworth, 1934), and exocrine pancreatic and glucose transporters activity levels (Gibbs et al., 1995).

If I want to be healthy should I focus on optimizing the listed factors or focus on a diet that achieves a particular glucose response? If glucose response is dependent on the listed factors, wouldn't it make sense to focus on those factors- the cause of my glucose response? If I should be focused on those factors, why do you suggest I worry about how a diet fits my glucose response? 

*How effective at lowering rates of the diseases you mentioned do you believe tailoring one's diet to glucose response will be?

That's why Kyoto failed (besides W's pullout). You may remember 2009's cop was widely seen as a failure. Now, you have to ask what the agenda of the media is. It's certainly not to see the conference be a success. It is mostly the media keeping any climate change ""debate"" alive.

One of the biggest problems I see is that these agreements are voluntary. It's why the goals are never met. If there is no enforcement then these countries can just do what they want.  If the economy craps out then all the agreements will be going out the window. If you really wanted the goals to be met then you would need some kind of global authority that had enforcement power to force these countries to play by the rules. No such institution exists.

"cx9lxzx","t3_3tsxx8","3tsxx8","collapse","skeptical","I watched a video by a scientist the other day who was also highly critical of the IPCC and the plan to simply cut emissions. He argued we needed to pull carbon dioxide out of the air down to below 280 ppm (or some such - it was somewhere in the 200s) or we risk extreme temperature increase over a millennium scale because of ocean turnover rates.

He said we could fix this with forest regeneration alone in a matter of decades. I lost the video - does anyone know who I'm talking about and how to evaluate his claim against the impossibility of pulling out 10 billions tons a year in the first video posted?

The scientist in the video had quite dire predictions - something like 17 or 22 degrees Celsius increase baked into the system now over a 1000 year scale.","2015-11-23 00:53:07","2","EntropyAnimals","1747845210.232502","sea level projections","manual"
