What is a harmful algal bloom and how do we forecast one? Find out when you Ask Us Anything!","Hi Reddit! We are Richard Stumpf (oceanographer) and Karen Kavanaugh (Harmful Algal Bloom project coordinator) from NOAA’s National Ocean Service. With harmful algal bloom season beginning over the next few months in several areas of the U.S., we wanted to take this opportunity to talk about our work on harmful algal blooms. 

Harmful algal blooms, or HABs, occur when colonies of algae—simple plants that live in the sea and freshwater—grow out of control while producing toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds. The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal.

We’ll cover the basics on HABs, our research, as well as dive into how we forecast harmful algal blooms for coastal communities. 

**We’re here from 1:00 to 3:00 PM ET….ask us anything!**

**EDIT:**

Hey HABs People!!
We are out of time, but thank you for all of your HABsolutely amazing questions! We appreciate your interest in this topic. In case we didn’t get to your question--there were so many!--some of our online resources will hopefully help you find answers. 

We’ve put together a page that has many HABs resources in one place. Take a look here:  http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/hab/

Ask me anything about careers in chemistry!","Hello Redditeers!  I'm happy to take this opportunity to help you and hopefully we'll have some fun along the way as well!

First, a little bit about myself:  I graduated from Villanova University with a Bachelor of Science, Comprehensive Program, minoring in Chemistry.  I liked Villanova so much I decided to stay there to study organic chemistry.  Under the direction of Dr. Robert Giuliano, I worked on a thesis project in carbohydrate chemistry which I defended to earn a Master of Science in Chemistry.  By the way, I'm very proud that Villanova won March Madness and are the 2016 NCAA Champions!  Go Wildcats!  

From Villanova, I was hired by Arkema in the Additives group, where I was responsible for optimizing organometallic synthetic processes for transfer to pilot plant, for exploring applications development with tin catalysts in polyester resins, and for optimizing processes for tin catalyst synthesis.  I then accepted a position as Scientist at GlaxoSmithKline, where I was responsible for large-scale, preparative synthesis of active pharmaceutical intermediates for internal medicinal chemistry customers.  This transitioned into a more traditional, medicinal chemistry role where I worked on synthesizing pharmaceutical analogs for safety assessment studies.  I feel fortunate that I've seen both chemical manufacturing and the pharmaceutical industry up close -- it's been an interesting experience for me.

Right now, I'm wearing multiple hats for the ACS.  I'm currently volunteering for the [American Chemical Society Philadelphia Section](http://philadelphia.sites.acs.org/), where I serve as the Career Services Committee Chairperson.  I'm responsible for establishing a program of networking events and a series of career workshops hosted by the Section as well as a Career Club moderated by our local ACS Career Consultants.  On a national level, I serve the American Chemical Society as a [Career Consultant]( http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-services/ccp.html) and Presenter for the [ACS Career Pathways](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-services/career-pathways.html) series of Career Workshops which you'll see at ACS National and Regional Meetings.  Additionally, I also serve as a consultant to the ACS Council of Economic and Professional Affairs.  I live outside of Philadelphia with my wife and two sons.  Right now, I am currently teaching my sons an appreciation of such fine Philadelphia cuisine such as soft pretzels and hoagies -- so far they approve.

**I'll be back at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time to answer your chemistry career questions -- please ask away!**

EDIT:  Greeting Redditeers!  I am here to answer your questions -- in fact, I had a head-start!  Please ask me anything about chemistry careers.  I am here to help you!

"4leeln","collapse","skeptical","What we don't know","Let's be clear. What we're facing is the extinction of the human race.

I've seen a lot of blather about how a path to extinction isn't included in the package of economic desolation and environmental devastation we find ourselves unwrapping lately. How the human species has survived climate change before, how hunter gatherers can survive in isolated environments for centuries, how we may have a dieoff, but extinction is unthinkable.

I think that shows a stunning lack of imagination.

I want to go on a brief journey though some of the unknown factors we're facing as we reap the results of tossing [billions of tons of carbon dioxide](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/carbon-dioxide-earths-hottest-topic-just-warming) into the atmosphere every year. It's really easy to look at the projected sea level rises, the projected air and sea temperature rises, the increasing acidification of the oceans, and be convinced that we have a grasp of what we're up against. It looks, from our perspective here in 2016, like a bunch of smooth curves that we'll be climbing into some unimaginably hellish, but ultimately survivable future.

Instead, I think we're about to be surprised by the consequences of environmental disequilibrium. We're increasing the odds of a whole lot of bad things happening, and some of them we can't even begin to predict. Let's take a look at a few that we can.

The obvious one is the blue ocean event. This one is fun because we know it's going to happen, we just don't know when. The [US Navy](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/dec/09/us-navy-arctic-sea-ice-2016-melt) predicted it for this summer back in [2013](http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/local_news/article_f0d1fc46-56dc-11e3-9766-001a4bcf6878.html), and that's [not out of the question](https://robertscribbler.com/tag/blue-ocean-event/). So, what will it mean?

We're not sure. [We know](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/arctic-sea-ice-loss-implications/) it will include a lot more sunlight absorbed by the newly lowered albedo, resulting in warmer waters around the arctic, increasing storm frequency and strength. Oh, and the jet stream will weaken with the decreased global temperature gradient. It'll speed the melting of Greenland, which [may proceed unpredictably](http://www.rollingstone.com/feature/greenland-melting).

That's going to accelerate subsea permafrost melt in the Arctic. I'm not going to go deep into the implications of that [when it comes to methane](http://meetings.copernicus.org/www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/01526/EGU2008-A-01526.pdf), but suffice it to say that if the 1500 gigatons of methane clathrates under the East Siberian Sea decide to let out a burp, it could be bad. Because we currently have just 5 gigatons of methane in the entire atmosphere. Oh, and the ESS is tectonically unstable.

Even without earthquakes, the melting of the Arctic ice creates a whole new Arctic hazard; [tsunamis](https://www.newsdeeply.com/arctic/articles/2016/03/25/the-icy-fire-beneath-norways-seabed). Imagine if you will what the effects of a big chunk of continental shelf letting go would be, [right in the middle](http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2014/06/earthquakes-and-warm-water-threaten-arctic.html) of the most sensitive environment on the planet.

So, to sum up the Arctic portion of my diatribe, we're about to see what happens when we have a major change in our climate state. We have no idea what the climate will do once we lose the Arctic ice, or how long it will take, but there's [considerable evidence](https://agwobserver.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/papers-on-ecosystem-response-to-past-climate/) that the climate has changed very quickly in the past. Sometimes in [as little as a year](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ice-core-reveals-how-quickly-climate-can-change/). And we don't know what it's changing into.

Now, all of these changes are being caused by the stuff we're pumping into the atmosphere; the gaseous detritus of human civilization. But I'm not convinced that we understand the full implications of those emissions yet. After all, it was just a few years ago that we figured out that [leaded gasoline led to crime waves](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health). Who knows what other gases that we're soaking in have unanticipated consequences? We've got toxic [firefighting foam](https://theintercept.com/2015/12/16/toxic-firefighting-foam-has-contaminated-u-s-drinking-water-with-pfcs/) invading our water supplies, the stuff used in making [teflon](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid--pfoa) is an omnipresent cancer risk. What else are we missing?

Well, how about the long-term health effects of increased carbon dioxide. It's gone from around 300ppm to 400 ppm in a human lifetime. We know it's keeping trees [from cooling the planet](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100503161435.htm), it's [devastating marine life](http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2007/01/), it's [encouraging the spread of pests](http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/impacts/Global-warming-insects.html#.V0kNOuSWOAA). What's it going to do to us?

Well, we don't know. The most obvious effect will be that even in the best parts of the planet, [you'll be living in the equivalent of a stuffy office](http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/jun252006/1607.pdf), so headaches, general malaise, dizziness, that sort of thing. Other current health effects include [making us stupid](http://www.skepticalscience.com/how-sapiens-in-the-world-of-high-co2-concentration.html) and possibly [fat](https://thesenecaeffect.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/the-effects-of-elevated-carbon-dioxide-on-our-health/).  But long-term exposure causes respiratory acidosis, and we don't know what effects that has over the course of years or decades.[This paper](http://grapevine.com.au/~pbierwirth/co2toxicity.pdf) sums it up nicely.

It's pretty easy to think of a post-collapse future and envision bands of hardy hunter-gatherers, bravely ekeing out a living once civilization has fallen. After all, we've been through periods of climate change before as a species.

We have, but not really well. It looks like there was a period of time where we were down to around 2,000 individuals for [a few thousand years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck). Once you're down that low, survival is a question of luck, and I don't really want to roll the dice on that one twice.

Our hardy band of hunter-gatherers is going to be up against an increase in agricultural pests, an increase in heat, an increase in catastrophic weather events, an increase in diseases, a decrease in food output, a decrease in available potable water, the lingering effects of environmental toxins, and the unknown aftereffects of the decline of civilization. And they're going to have to do it while dealing with severely curtailed brainpower due to increased CO2.

Yes, the human race is adaptable. Yes, we're intelligent. Yes, we've survived a lot so far.

But it's easy to see where we're stacking the deck against the survival of the species. I haven't even gone into the effects of the massive wave of extinctions we're dealing with, or the possibility that as things wind down we'll see the nukes deployed. Hell, I didn't even touch on global dimming.

The damage from all of this is cumulative. Just because we understand some aspects of all of these systems doesn't mean we can predict what happens when we break all of them at once. We have no precedent on which to base predictions of what happens when we put this much carbon and pollutants into the atmosphere of a planet in a short period of time; we can only make educated guesses, and hope for the best.

So if you find yourself reassured by the smooth curves on the IPCC reports and the hubris that we're too smart to be wiped out, please consider the possibility that you've massively underestimated the scope of the problems we're facing.

"4ihf3k","collapse","skeptical","This Is the Way that the World Will End: Peter Ward on Greenhouse Mass Extinction","Peter D. Ward is an American paleontologist, a professor at the University of Washington and a prolific author for the lay reader of science fact. The principal area of his research has been the mass extinction events of Earth’s history. Peter Ward was among the first declare that several of these events were ‘Greenhouse Extinctions’, and the evidence continues to accumulate that he is correct to do so. I developed this post in recognition of the three books he has written on the subject. I find my thinking crystalizing around them.

*Under the Green Sky: Global Warming, the Mass Extinctions of the Past, and What They Can Tell Us About Our Future* (2007)

This volume examines the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event, the most devastating of the Big Five Mass Extinctions. Paleontologists call this ‘The Great Dying’, for it appears from the fossil record that over 90% of complex species, both terrestrial and marine, perished from Earth over a brief geological period. This is a handy scorecard for ‘Big Five’.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events

With the 1980 discovery of the Chicxulub asteroid impact by Luis and Walter Alvarez and its clear association with the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction, many paleontologists took this as a the common cause for these events, and geologists began to search for ancient impact craters just as crime scene investigators look for bullet holes. Others disagreed; indeed, a few still argue that the extinction of the dinosaurs was ongoing before the *coup de grace* of Chicxulub. Much of *Green Sky* examines this contentious academic debate and follows Ward’s own fieldwork on the ‘Great Dying’ (He studies the marine mollusks of that period.). He judged that the means of execution had not been the bang of the cosmic firing squad but a whimpering death inside of a terrestrial gas chamber. What follows is my brief, and inadequate, description of the proposed ‘killing mechanism’.

It begins with an exogenous shock to the Biosphere. In the case of the Permian-Triassic Extinction, it was the eruption of a system of volcanoes in what is today Siberia. For a million years the eruptions continued, until the molten flow had buried two million square kilometers, a geological feature known as the Siberian Traps. In addition to the carbon dioxide from the Earth’s interior, these eruptions would have vaporized extensive, overlying coal deposits, and the subsequent warming might have destabilized methane clathrates and other carbon sinks as well. The intense spike in global temperature strongly suggests the creation of a ‘runaway greenhouse’.

How hot was it? The Wiki page sources a 2012 paper published in *Science*, titled ‘Lethally Hot Temperatures During the Early Triassic Greenhouse’ that estimates *ocean surface temperatures of 40C (104F)*.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event

The prevailing winds drive currents over the surface of the ocean, and thermohaline conveyers move the deep waters of the ocean basins in circulatory loops that span the globe. Most who have bothered to read this far know about the Gulf Stream and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, so I will not struggle to explain the details of this system. What is critical is that both the prevailing winds and the deep-sea currents result from *differences in temperatures between equatorial and polar regions*, and as more uniform temperatures come to an ice-free, hothouse Earth, *this circulation will cease to occur*. The thermohaline conveyer is what replenishes oxygen in the deep ocean basins, and Peter Ward believes that interrupting it will result in another reprise of the hypothesized Canfield Ocean of a billion years ago. This stratified ocean will be both anoxic and sulfidic, that is, it is devoid of oxygen and full of hydrogen sulfide, the highly toxic gas that smells like rotten eggs.

Where will the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas come from? Before cyanobacteria evolved, there was very little free oxygen (O2) on Earth, yet the world swarmed with microbial life. Some of these anaerobic organisms performed photosynthesis too, but instead of O2, they produced and used H2S. Contrarily, O2 is toxic to them, and so, such sulfur bacteria now exist only in marginal environments, notably in the ecosystems of the ‘black smoking’ vents in the deep ocean. However, should a warm, stagnant, oxygen-free Canfield Ocean recur, they find themselves at home again throughout its waters.

As sulfur bacteria reclaim the depths of the Canfield Ocean, H2S will rise in the water column, killing any aerobic organisms that are surviving the heat. Once this H2S environment reaches the sunlit upper layer, photosynthetic green and purple sulfur bacteria will bloom profusely. There is evidence of this in the fossil layers of the Permian-Triassic. Peter Ward believes that the H2S concentration can rise to a lethal level in the atmosphere as well, to the extent that it will turn the blue sky to ""a washed green tinge, a vomitous [sic] color.” In addition, H2S will scrub away the ozone layer, allowing more UV radiation to shine down upon a torrid, poisoned world. This can explain why maybe as few as *four percent of known species* survived an existence *Under a Green Sky*.

Ward’s next book continued this theme: *The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?* (2009).

Essentially, this is a refutation of James Lovelock’s Gaia theory. In an apt contrast to the loving Earth Mother Gaia, Medea is a figure of Greek myth and drama who, as an act of revenge against her husband, murders her own children. In Ward’s Medea Hypothesis, the Biosphere (and it is important to note that the Biosphere has always been largely microbial) does not regulate itself to maintain the Earth in a habitable state; rather, the microbial component is itself the usual cause of mass extinctions.

Ward’s list of such auto-extinction events includes the Great Oxygenation Event where cyanobacteria drove sulfur-loving life to the margins, two Snowball Earths where the *depletion of greenhouse gasses* (is this irony?) caused the Earth to freeze over, and at least five mass extinctions of more complex life by the Runaway Greenhouse and its Hydrogen Sulfide.

Here is a ten-minute, YouTube audio clip from *Radio Ecoshock* program where Ward himself explains his book.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICbrSgfyQqQ

*The Medea Hypothesis* offers a disturbing insight – the much vaunted Balance of Nature may be as much of a myth as the Self-Regulating Market of Adam Smith. Ward ends the book with the bold assertion that human survival requires us to become the geo-engineering custodians of the planet, not only to correct our own depredations, but in preparation for ones that the Biosphere can manifest on its own. Mass extinction is not always a random event; it is an intrinsic property of Life itself.

Finally (hurrah! tl;dr) the trilogy ends with a book titled *The Flooded Earth: Our Future In a World Without Ice Caps* (2010). Ward presents our future with a series of science-fictional scenarios, notably tagged with the rising measurements of sea level and ppm of CO2. Drowned islands, port cities and farmlands, a hundred million peasants displaced from Bangladesh, the Netherlands reclaimed by the North Sea: all the very familiar stuff is here, and so I found this to be the least interesting of the books. Ward offers three outcomes for our future, which I interpret as

- Chicken Little: The greenhouse deniers were right. We are in for a mild inconvenience. This is, of course, Pure Bullshit.

- Heroic Humanity: A rapid conversion away from fossil fuels and extensive geo-engineering hold the rise of temperature to under 2C and that of the ocean to two meters. This will be a mere global catastrophe but not our extinction. For me, this may be possible but is not likely.

> “Then there is the third possibility, the one as a scientist I believe is the most likely: the ice sheets will melt rapidly, the sea rises, and all the scenarios set forth in this book come to pass.”

I call this one, Nothing but Green Skies Do I See. For it, Ward offered a final scenario:

>Old Seattle, 5115 CE. Carbon Dioxide at 1,200 ppm.

And this is my paraphrase of it.

Eighty meters of sea level rises has left some of the few inhabitants of the Future living on the seven small coastal islands that were once the hills beneath Seattle. With Earth at a new and much higher temperature, they subsist on a few tropical crops (most animals, and especially birds, are now extinct) and struggle to breath the sulfur dioxide (Ward claims that humans have a higher tolerance for the gas than most mammals). The stinking poison wafts from the purple Western Canfield Ocean (photosynthetic purple sulfur bacteria now mat the surface of the former Pacific Ocean), and they squint through cataracts (from UV exposure) at the sick Green Horizon.

Ward suggests a rough timeline to this anthropomorphic Greenhouse Extinction. First comes another few centuries of Fossil-Fueled Civilization.

> “What began as an industrial revolution in the 1800s and progressed as an oil economy in the 1900s, only to end as a coal economy in the 2100s and 2200s, will offer us a recipe for potential human extinction.” Pg.147

That is from the middle of the book, but the basis for that eye-popping ‘1200 ppm’ has to be an assumption that we will end up burning everything can. Afterward comes a Total Collapse of both Civilization and ocean circulation, and a two thousand year interval for the ocean basins to go completely anoxic and stew with sulfur-loving organisms. Then, allow another 500 years for the photosynthetic zone to fill with green and purple sulfur bacteria. Compared to timetables to human extinction projected by Guy McPherson or Robert Scribbler, this seems a leisurely pace.

Can we actually reach 1200 ppm of CO2? One thing I learned from this book is that the thermohaline sinking also carries carbon dioxide into the deep ocean basins, where it reacts with carbonate sediments. This is one of the more effective carbon sinks, but our present rate of combustion is overwhelming its capacity. Should the ocean circulation begin to shut down, will that cause atmospheric CO2 levels to rise even faster? Now, let me try to tally up the available carbon. Burn all the extractable fossil fuels, lose most of the forests and grasslands, fire the clathrate gun and thaw all the carbon from the permafrost: someone who reads this will have a better grasp of the arithmetic, but to me, it seems doable. What an achievement! We are now as mighty, and just as mindless, as those ancient Siberian volcanoes.

What is alarming is how out-of-date the data in this relatively recent book is. Ward writes about current levels of CO2 at 385ppm – ah, those were the days. He considers whether James Hansen’s *previous projections* of ice sheet melt and sea level rise were excessive – what must he think of the new, accelerated schedule? He suggests geo-engineering projects that we now consider as unfeasible -- by the way, when all of that cooling sulfate aerosol precipitates into the oceans, is that just fertilizer for sulfur-loving microbes? I could list here a dozen papers that support his thesis, ones that have appeared here on r/Collapse in the past year, but this is post has rambled on much too long.

Are we already past the point of no return? Survival of this event will analogous to Humanity holding its collective breath for many millennia. This existential threat is real, it demands extreme action now, and yet not one in a thousand are aware of it.

I end with a plug for what I consider to be Peter D. Ward’s best book:
*Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe* with Donald Brownlee (2000)

The title says it all. His Greenhouse Extinction Trilogy may be only a tragic postscript to that book.
