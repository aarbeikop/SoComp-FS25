"dx13ytn","t3_8asbub","8asbub","environment","emotional","This is what I see going forward. Let me know what you think.

Polar sea ice gone by 2020 to 2025. I don’t think a blue water Arctic is the end. It will be a harbinger. With the loss of the albedo effect from sea ice, temperature rises will be more stark. Frozen carbon and methane trapped in shallow Arctic seabeds and Arctic region permafrost - already bubbling and off-gassing from tens of thousands of sites - will see dramatic increases release into the atmosphere. There is double the greenhouse gasses trapped in the Arctic. The polar vortex will become even more destabilized and may break down. Major weather extremes will pick up frequency, devastating infrastructure and agriculture.

Our growing hungry and desperate populations - estimated to hit 10 billion by 2050 - will accelerate deforestation, habitat destruction, poaching and encroaching. They have to, because the Earth is losing arable land to salinization (from irrigation, sea level rises and storm surges), water erosion, depletion of fertility, windblown topsoil loss exacerbated by tilling, etc. Global meat consumption continues to rise, thanks to emerging nations’ prosperity, requiring even more fields to be cleared to grow food for livestock. (Sorry, vegans, hope doesn’t change billions of diets overnight. Your best efforts and comments, videos, books, presentations, graphic images of factory farming, etc. over the past several decades have not slowed consumption).

Greenland’s already “faster than expected” melt will accelerate even more dramatically once a blue water Arctic becomes reality, as sea water there heats up. World sea levels will see truly noticeable rises from that. The giant kilometer-thick ice of Antarctica will still be there. Though that, too, will be picking up calving and melting acceleration. It may take a few decades or more for Antarctica’s ice to go, but serious sea level rises will mean tens of thousands of human cities (including garbage dumps and hundreds of nuclear power plants) will be inundated, especially by king tides and storm surges. (You will not want to be living near the ocean in a few years’ time.)

Even as that occurs, the cumulative acidification and warming of the oceans will pick up. Already, plankton, mollusks, coral, etc. and other creatures at the base are stressed and experiencing difficulties, as per this article. The bottom of the food chain and oxygen generation (ocean phytoplankton generate half the oxygen on this planet) will fall out - even as fleets of desperate trawlers and millions of fishermen seek to pillage even more from collapsed stocks.
Animals are disappearing in palpable numbers. To support humanity’s increase from 4 billion to almost 7.6 billion (including our ecological footprint), over half of all animals (terrestrial and marine) had to die.

Yet the rates of deforestation and desertification have increased, not decreased. Species are disappearing in at a frenzied pace. Overall ecological and environmental collapse has become really noticeable lately. It will be even more noticeable going forward. Rhinos, elephants, giraffes, orangutans, tigers, etc. will be gone from the wild.

Perhaps enough of us humans will realize our folly once we are no longer able to insulate ourselves from the consequences of our actions. By then, however, it will have been too little, too late...

When you think about it, we are on a massive ship with a small engine. It takes decades to get up to speed; we’ve had a few centuries. Even small course corrections take decades to begin, decades to implement, and decades to begin seeing real results. To make changes in time, we needed to have started decades ago: strict laws on extraction, production, consumption, reproduction, pollution, and disposition. None of it has happened. In fact, the bridge has ordered the ship’s engine room to increase power to the thrusters. The wheel is locked on course. Now is the time to come to terms.
