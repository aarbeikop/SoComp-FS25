This is mostly a case of highlighting some soundbites and ignoring others. He also says in the same interview: ""Snow will probably cause chaos in 20 years time""

>Australia’s “permanent” drought

The actual thing being stated is that climate change predicts a substantially declining total precipitation and greater drought occurrence in Southern Australia. If you read up it's clear they talk about individual instances of drought in terms of natural variability, but the long term trend is towards greater drought. A few wetter years doesn't disprove this.

>2009 is expected to be one of the top-five warmest years on record

As far as I can see, it was.

>A new global temperature record will be set in 2009 or 2010

2010 was a new record.

>“looks like its going to be one of the most intense [solar] cycles since record-keeping began almost 400 years ago,”

How is that a climate prediction?

>There’s a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 we’ll have an ice-free (summer) Arctic

Very much an outlier prediction. The IPCC said around 2080 for Summer, 2040 (possibly as early as 2025) for September.

>“The entire north polar ice cap will be gone in 5 years”

See above, assuming accurate quoting.

>Arctic summers ice-free ‘by 2013’ 2007 Professor Wieslaw Maslowski

Pretty sure this is the same thing again, see above: outlier.

>The UK Met Office forecast up to 2014

Experimental decadal prediction. Short periods are highly sensitive to initial conditions so forecasting is inherently difficult, but attempts are being made in the hopes of making progress.

>the region will have an ice-free season in six years(2015).

Not clear what the prediction is here. Canadian sea ice or total Arctic sea ice? Another article carrying the quote talks about loss of multi-year sea ice by 2015, not necessarily the whole lot.

>$8-a-litre petrol in Australia by 2018

As noted, not climate related.

>In the 2020s, an intense heatwave equal to the longest on record from 1951 to 1999 is likely to occur as many as five times a decade in parts of the United States

Not sure on the specifics, but yes, there will be more heatwaves in future. Not sure what the problem is here?

>St Andrews golf course could crumble into the North Sea by 2050

As the word 'crumble' indicates, this is only partly climate related. The area is at risk from coastal erosion anyway.

>Tibetan glacial shrink to cut water supply by 2050

Again, don't know specifics but seems reasonable as a general point.

>Millions of Nigerians may have to flee rising sea levels by 2058 “In 50 years with a one-metre sea-level rise, two million, three million people would be homeless

It seems more scientific to say ""these are the trends, this is what is causing it, and this is what will happen down the line if nothing changes."" Because even if a specific prediction is slightly wrong or slightly off target, it only gives climate change denialism strength. So if by 2058, millions of Nigerians don't flee but only 1,999,999 Nigerians flee, then climate change deniers can say ""Ah ha! I told you climate change is a hoax.""

2 - Another question touched on the subject of overall mapping of the ocean on the surface and below, are we coming closer to an understanding the fluctuation in pressures at extreme depths also relevant to the increase/decrease in heights.
