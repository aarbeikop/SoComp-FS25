I have a question with regards to drinking water treatment plants. As I'm sure you are aware, a few years ago the city of Toledo, OH had their entire water system shut down due to microcystin contamination from HABs.

Have you ever worked with a drinking water utility to help predict an HAB outbreak? How early can you make that kind of prediction?

What's your point of view and how would you encourage young chemist graduates to search for job oportunities beyond their niche field?

Question comes up because I'm a chemical engineer with a specialty in food chemistry. Thing is: back in my town the only jobs I could apply with those credentials were ""chief of staff"" for industrial cafeterias or quality inspector for some food processing companies. However after trying out for a job with a chemical company focused on metalworking I ended up landing a job that turned out to be a very good career. Basically because a lot of things you need to take care of in food also apply with industrial chemicals (ph, temperature, storage, etc).

How do you explain career viability to people with STEM backgrounds, specifically chemistry?

Strongly consider your future before pursuing chemistry. I'm not saying DON'T DO IT, but look at all of these comments in this thread. There is an enormous group of us who would do it completely differently.

Cause and effect is well established - Our current Civilization will destroy the Biosphere.

I wish it were just that - this an absence of *simple comprehension*. Little remains to be imagined, just list and collate the facts. It appears that we are simply too stupid or delusional for survival.

I share your disbelief in a future of 'hunting and gathering among the ruins'. We have entered into another Mass Extinction Event. Yet even otherwise astute commentators, like Gail Tverberg, in her AMA here, suggest 

>Hunter Gatherer would be easier to accomplish than farmer, because we have lost much of what would be needed for the transition.

There will be nothing to hunt and gather from. The Chicxulub asteroid took out the dinosaurs and seventy percent of all recorded species, while the Permian Greenhouse Extinction exterminated well over ninety percent. After each of those events, it took millions of years for biodiversity to recover to its former level - inside of totally novel ecosystems, of course. As E. O. Wilson pointedly titles the second chapter of his last book 'Humanity Needs a Biosphere'. 

Taking to a lifeboat can only guarantee survival in the short term. In the absence of rescue, pray that you are close to a hospitable shore. A million years is a very far distance to row.

The lifeboats of the *Titanic*, already insufficient in number, departed while only half full.

I've been reading up on arcology recently and doing some brainstorming, and it looks almost impossible to actually construct one that can survive on its own in the long-term in most regions.

1. Biospheres 1 and 2, BIOS-3, and MARS-500 were all plagued with multiple and very different problems ranging from unforeseen variables in maintaining a closed habitat to psychological stress making participants *absolutely fucking crazy*. Any arcology is going to run into the same problems, and overcoming them is a huge engineering challenge.

2. Arcology projects do not have a good track record. The Dongtan arcology collapsed before the 2010 World Expo. Crystal Island lost funding after the 2008 financial crisis. Seward's Success was never constructed. The only ""successful"" arcologies that exist are perhaps the Las Vegas Strip and McMurdo Station in Antarctica, and neither of them are actually sustainable and making them sustainable seems impossible.

3. I don't think it is controversial to say that vertical farming is basically the only way an arcology can feed itself, which itself has many unresolved issues in terms of sustainability. On top of that, hydro/aeroponics systems are only good for producing herbs, drugs, and salad greens. Aquaponics shows promise, but the sustainability challenges for those are even larger.

4. Sustainable energy, itself, is vulnerable to climate change. Venezuela found out the hard way that producing most of your power from hydroelectric dams leaves you vulnerable to sustained drought. Solar is only useful in equatorial regions, which are also the regions with the greatest challenges due to global warming. Wind power is intermittent and would make the arcology's footprint enormous. Fossil fuels are right out. Only nuclear and geothermal seem to be useful in terms of arcologies, which means we either build around volcanos or we start dumping spent fuel rods into the ocean. Not great.

5. Water presents a problematic constraint. If we build near fresh water sources, flooding becomes a risk. If we build near oceans and rely on desalination, sea level rise and superstorms become a risk. If we rely on aquifers, geothermal becomes difficult and we risk relying on a depleting resource. If we rely on rain, drought becomes a risk. Only a self-contained water management system could work, which itself presents enormous engineering challenges on the scale required for an arcology.

7. You might be familiar with the Mouse Utopia Experiment. Mice were given all the food, water, nesting they needed to live comfortably. They all went crazy and killed each other long before the resources were even strained, and while we don't know *why* the best guess is oversocialization. We do not know how vulnerable human populations would be to the same problems or how to resolve those problems, and as with the Mouse Utopia it could spell disaster in a very short amount of time.

8. The division of labor presents another constraint. I've seen estimates that you need an urban population of over 100k to sustain intellectual labor, as otherwise there is too much physical labor to do for people to spend time learning complex mathematics or physics. This either means the arcology has to be *fucking huge* or we need to offload a lot more labor onto automation than we currently can. Otherwise, our capacity to tackle challenges as they arise will become crippled by our lack of innovation.

9. An arcology also has to either have a more efficient recycling system than has ever been constructed or it needs a way to acquire new resources for replacing worn out or broken parts. Unless this arcology is extremely low-tech, it needs to have a source of valuable minerals and chemicals to keep itself running. This presents constraints on where you can build, and will necessarily increase the footprint of the structure.

10. Last, but most importantly, if we build a self-sustaining arcology it will be the first one to ever exist. We won't have time to build more experimental projects to test for unforeseen problems, so we'll be discovering new challenges along the way. An unaccounted variable could mean disaster for the entire population, so we'll need to build lots of different ones and hope that one survives.

All together, we are talking about *multiple* multi-trillion dollar projects that only a few hundred thousand could possibly benefit from. Good luck convincing the poor that the super rich deserve to live in Elysium while they are forced to inherit Venus.","2016-05-28 22:30:18","2","[deleted]","1747850392.623827","sea level projections","manual"

"d3nru3j","t3_4leeln","4leeln","collapse","skeptical","Another fine example of illogical, fantasy-based thinking.

The problem you seem to be having is understanding what ""extinction"" actually means. You don't get to ""extinction"" by lumping together a bunch of random bad things we're unsure about, and then kind of wave your hands and say, ""... and then everyone dies!"" That's not an argument. To make extinction believable, **you have to show evidence** that the specific things you're talking about can make the **entire planet** uninhabitable for homo sapiens.

I'll give you an easy example. Let's say (for the sake of argument) that something about global warming this time is somehow very different from every other time it's happened in the last 2 billion years, and it basically turns the Earth into another Venus. **That** would be an example of extinction, because obviously we (nor anything else) can survive temperatures that can melt lead or the pressure of 90 atmospheres. 

You haven't done anything like that. You point to a list of smaller events (comparatively), wave your hands and say ""we don't know"", and then conclude: extinction.

Sorry. That's fantasy thinking.

Sometimes it doesn't even seem like you even understand what you're talking about. ""Our hardy band of hunter-gatherers is going to be up against an increase in agricultural pests."" Do you know what hunter-gatherers are? You do realize that we've been here for 200,000 years, right? And that most of that time had nothing to do with agriculture?

You also have to address the arguments of your opponents. Just waving your hands and calling every argument against extinction ""hubris"" does not count as evidence, nor does it count as an argument. It's basically an emotional, faith-based, fact-free response.

I'll close by pointing out an uncomfortable truth about collapse and people who talk about it. On a basic level, there are those among us (those concerned about collapse) who aren't here for rational reasons. There are people drawn to collapse for the same reason people are drawn to apocalyptic religions -- there is some weird part of them that wants to see the human race destroy itself.

And that's basically what we have here: you start with the conclusion that the human race will go extinct, and then work backwards, listing a bunch of random things (that are indeed bad) hoping it will magically ""add up"" to the outcome you've placed your faith in... but it doesn't. Not even close.","2016-05-29 05:43:01","2","mcapello","1747850392.6400855","sea level projections","manual"

And we are so very much faster than they ever were.

The planet is an insanely complex set of interlocking systems, all of which are pretty robust in their own way. Ecosystems can adapt to pretty substantial damage, when it's done on a local scale.

We've just burned billions of years of accumulated energy in two hundred years. That's an enormous amount of energy, and it's changed our planet beyond recognition. We've only begun to understand the extent to which we've fucked it up. With all due respect to climatologists, most of whom I think would agree with me, the idea that we understand the system well enough to really comprehend what we've done to it is ludicrous.

We've smashed a watch with a sledgehammer, and now we're wondering where all the pieces will end up.","2016-05-09 13:16:43","13","MrVisible","1747850410.9156332","sea level projections","manual"

Setting aside the chicken little one, it seems like a false dichotomy between heroically keeping temps under 2C or burning everything in the absolute worst possible way.  It seems like there is a lot of room for an outcome between those two.  For example, I think it highly unlikely that population levels will remain anywhere near as high as they are for more than a few decades at the absolute most.  There's not going to be 10 Billion people burning coal in 2100.  At least I highly doubt it.  If the population plummets due to energy constraints, phosphorus depletion, soil erosion etc., in the next few decades, I think the silver lining for whoever survives is that the worst case greenhouse scenarios are avoided.  I think sometimes scientists neglect to factor in economics, resources etc., the same way economists tend to (less forgivably, in my opinion) ignore science.","2016-05-09 03:40:23","6","8footpenguin","1747850410.9251516","sea level projections","manual"
