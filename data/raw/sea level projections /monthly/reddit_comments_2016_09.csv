In your work, what is the most interesting tidbit of info about the inhabitants you have come across?    

I imagine you are or will be involved with many apocryphal texts that most people will not have seen.  Is there anything that you have seen or read that has affected your personal beliefs?

Brent - What has been the biggest non-technical eye-opener for you?

Michael - What or how do you think these technological advancements will affect the modern world's understanding of religion?  Do you think that the internet / having open access to religious source documents leads to a reinforcement of religious institutionalism, or a de-centralization?

Seth - Do you see a lot of personal bias and inflection when working professionally on these things?  Are there people from all ends of the religious spectrum (atheist, devout etc) who work on these projects, or does it tend to be a pretty homogenized group of believers?  Do conversations about faith ever come up at work? Do they go pretty smoothly? (I imagine it may be a bit less of a hot-button topic for people in the field)

I did my masters project on this same thing over the course of 6 months trying to do it all myself!! As you can imagine it wasn't amazingly successful!!

The big problem I had was being unable to properly segment damaged or stuck together layers (think this may be due to the resolution of the CT machine I was using)! E.g 3 stuck together layers being seen as 1, creating a mismatch when I stitch that layer back together, and missing information due to the stuck ones not being read as their own layer!!

How did you get around this segmentation problem? Or was it the case of the 5 wraps being relativley undamaged!!

Just also wanted to say thanks!! The pre publication stuff you put out really helped me get started and gave me something to write about in the report! (Also made me feel better about my lack of 1 man band, not CS but physics, success if it was taking 8 computer scientists!!)
