However, the problem with this subject is that the impacts are broad and far-reaching rather than immediate and consistent in a way that regular people can easily comprehend. Attribution is an issue even for scientists. 

Human-driven climate change is continuously pumping more energy into the system, which does not mean a consistent change across the board, but rather a greater and greater likelihood of extreme weather events as well the far-reaching events like loss of permafrost, polar ice, glaciers and the like. Too much to list here. 

A consequence of the variable moment-to-moment impact is that anybody who doesn’t want to believe can easily find ways not to believe. I find it mostly futile to try to debate determined deniers.

mqd5tmo,1kdqjeo,climatechange,"When it comes to explaining it to denialists or people who are skeptical, I like to reference a simple experiment performed by Eunice Foote in 1856, as defaulting to the fundamental scientific principles behind anthropogenic warming is a good starting point.

She took two glass cylinders and filled one with ordinary air and one with CO2, and placed them on the windowsill in full sunlight. She found that the cylinder with CO2 heated up faster and stayed hot longer than the one containing the normal air mixture. This was the start of our scientific understanding of greenhouse gases and how they retain and spread heat throughout our atmosphere. 

Now ask your friend the following: do you think, that since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been emitting more CO2 and greenhouse gases through using oil, coal, and gas to generate products, power, and transportation? If they answer yes, then you can guide them through the next logical step of connecting the dots.

mqd9bvl,1kdqjeo,climatechange,"Starting in 1985, mid-autumn polar outbreaks in western north america stopped being as early and as cold as they used to be. Early cold snaps reduce the overwintering ability of the mountain pine beetle. By the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, 10s of millions of hectares (20s of millions of acres) of pine were killed by mountain pine beetles. The standing dead trees became a tinderbox, which led to some of the largest and most severe firestorms ever known, including studies of pre-historic fires (done by sampling soil layers). Just one of many interesting effects

The role of carbon dioxide is well understood. The rise of carbon dioxide is documented, and its rapid rise is unprecedented. The extra carbon can be traced to human combustion of fossil fuels through study of carbon isotope ratios and by demonstrating the quantity emitted closely matching the quantity accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans. Temperature records are clearly showing rapid temperature rise, more rapid than can be shown in the past several hundred thousand years

mqgjimm,1kdqjeo,climatechange,"CO2 will reach 800ppm within about 50 years if fossil fuel use continues. Compare this to 290ppm in the 1880s. Global temperature rose by 1.8°F as CO2 reached 400ppm, so 800ppm corresponds to a temperature rise of 8.3°F compared to 1880. The jet stream has moved 200 miles north and will move 1,000 miles north as CO2 rises. There are 3 “donuts” of air that circulate between the equator and the poles, with those over the equator called Hadley Cells. The polar vortex donut stabilize these air circulation patterns by drawing warm air downward creating a frigid desert area where no rain or snow can fall at the poles. These donuts are separated by the jet streams. Jet streams have been moving toward the poles at over a mile per year as CO2 rises. A 1,000 miles northward shift of the jet stream will collapse the polar vortex and shift monsoon rainfall from North America and Europe to polar latitudes that are now arid. The Atlantic Ocean lags behind air warming at 1°F warmer than the 1970s wile the AMOC current slowed 20%, so the AMOC will stop before we reach 800ppm atmospheric CO2. This combination of rising polar vortex and hot Gulf Stream water entering the Arctic will produce up to 270 feet of snow per year north of 50° latitude with little precipitation south of that. This will desertify most of North America and southern Europe and bury Canada and Northern Europe under glaciers. Tropical rainfall falls over a 2,000 mile wide belt over the equator, and this will expand up to 4,000 miles wide creating wet conditions over the Sahara Desert, Gobi Desert, Saudi Arabia, Chihuahua Desert and Sonoran Desert.",2025-05-04 02:24:07,2,comment

mqd9alo,1kdqjeo,climatechange,"Your friend is right about cycles, so you can’t really prove them wrong, but the problem is that we are seeing increases that are faster and potentially stronger than historical cycles. And that leads us to believe that we could see rapid changes that will overpower normal systems and the ability of life to adapt. 

We are breaking cycles because the amount of CO2 is far more present than it has been in the past, but I don’t know if you can convince your friend using facts alone. 

Once a person has committed to a point of view it can be difficult to persuade a person for many reasons. For one thing it could be that they spend a lot of time with other people with similar beliefs or have sources of information that reject these ideas. You may be up against a larger group dynamic and social influence. 

Essentially it’s you versus your friend’s community. And until your friend feels comfortable resisting their community, they may feel social pressure to conform, making them resistant. 

Also, no one likes to be told they are wrong. And resistance to new ideas may be a sign that a person feels attacked. If you observe repetitive statements, resistance or stubbornness, or they make comments about emotions, then they are showing signs of emotional thinking which you can’t really argue with. 

It’s best to address the emotions and take a listening and questioning stance to encourage emotions to quiet down, but also to gain a better understanding of how they reach their opinions. Inviting people into your world instead of trying to push ideas onto people can be effective, but if they rely on bad sources of information or feel socially pressured, they may agree with you for a short time, then switch back to old ideas. 

Which can be frustrating. Is that something you are prepared to commit to? 

It might be a lost cause for now. But many people are noticing undeniable changes and in time they may be forced to reckon with disasters whether they want to or not. Which is too bad, because we could really use more help right now, and not at the brink. 

Try to make amends with your feelings on this. Just because you know something doesn’t mean people are ready to accept that too. And sometimes you have to let people fail for themselves. Figure it out on their terms. Which is hard when we care. But you can’t always force people to care. However, you may be able to invite them to walk with you and see what happens.

> Why is this shift happening now? Most often tornadoes are created by a supercell—a strong thunderstorm with a rotating updraft of air. Supercells tend to form when warm, humid, low-level air interacts with cool, dry, upper-level air, and climate change is generating warmer, moister air. Tornadoes also are more likely to develop when the local atmosphere is unstable, “and warming increases instability,” says Zuohao Cao, a tornado expert at Environment and Climate Change Canada, who co-led a recent study on storm touchdown locations. Climate change is warming the Gulf of Mexico as well, which can send generous amounts of water vapor into the southeastern U.S.

However, it’s not the magnitude of these parameters that scares me, it’s the rate of change. We are experiencing a rate of global temperature rise that is unprecedented. 

Prior extinction events, which occurred more than 50,000 years ago, were associated with temperature rates of about 1C/2,500 years. That rate of temperature rise was too fast for many species to adapt, and so they went extinct.

We are currently experiencing a rate of temperature rise that’s more like 1C/50 years, which is about 50X faster than earlier extinction events. This rate is not a prediction, it’s a fact and a rate this high is unprecedented in Earth’s history as we know it. 

The effects on humans from loss of species and biodiversity is unpredictable, but it will likely have an avalanche effect on agriculture, fisheries and food supplies.

Climate change has spread to every ecosphere on the planet but its measurable impacts are also often mixed up with other challenges like pollution and habitat loss (and natural climatic variation).  And they are often invisible to the casual viewer.  

The mechanism for anthropogenic climate change is actually very simple (which makes it less surprising that oil companies understood it in the 1950s already).

There are factors such as planetary mechanics (Milankovitch cycles), but they don't work at this time-scale; volcanos, not making a difference these days; solar irradiance, we actually just went through one of the coldest 11-year sun cycles in the last 100+ years while we broke temperature records the whole time...; atmospheric composition, well CO2 levels have increased massively the past 50 years due to us burning fossil fuels...

>  random year in the 20th century and find crazy hot temperatures like we see today

Literally not true, if speaking of yearly temperatures: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/temperature-anomaly?time=1900..2025

If he means daily temperatures: record heat temperatures are set at a much higher rate than cold records. The hot days are much, much, much more common now. That makes the average much hotter.",2025-05-03 20:44:06,1,comment

mqndd7p,1kdqjeo,climatechange,"One effect of climate change concerns has been that the world's innovators and entrepreneurs got serious about building solutions - particularly so since the 1990s.  So we have a wide range of actionable win/win commercial solutions for individuals, communities, regions and SMES to implement today.

The full scope of these solutions is at least as important to understand as the science and it's skeptics arguments.

Today's full spectrum of commercial, regenerative climate solutions offer a rich smorgasbord of business and career opportunities today - plus trillion dollar savings to business innovators.  Check out solution sets like **Project Regeneration**, **Project Drawdown.**  These solutions make the world better today - and don't need ""government policy"" to make them happen.

The innovative design principles and practices driving them also offer industry further of trillion dollar benefits in innovation and cost savings.  Check out innovation approaches like  Circular **Economy, BioEconomy, Systemic Design** and **Cradle to Cradle Product Innovation**.

These solutions have already created millions of new jobs in high-growth global industries from r**enewable energy** to **regenerative agriculture**, and millions more are in the pipeline.

Today's growing solutions sets offer great benefits to climate skeptics as well.  I know ""it's just normal cycles"" guys who love their EVs for their driving experience - and have rooftop solar because of the independence and cost savings it offers them.

Check out green solutions career resources - from jobs boards like **ClimateBase** to Project Drawdown's J**ob Function Action Guides**.

Today's solutions are systems solutions - so they also address much more visible issues from Fast Fashion waste and Ocean Plastics to Soil Depletion and Habitat Loss.

Most of the denialist arguments I've read end up saying ""therefore the world doesn't need to change"" and some even go on to imply ""therefore the world won't change"".

The time and energy you invest in ""is it true?"" and ""how bad will it be?"" and ""how do I convince someone against their will?"" could be better spent finding a solution that: 1) makes your bit of the world better today;  2) taking action on it;  3) having a whole lot of fun making a positive impact.

mqdbuy4,1kdqjeo,climatechange,"It is likely worse than they say as many models are purposely tempered to avoid accusations of ""doomerism"" and claims of absolute certainty regarding the future are a logical fallacy.

It has already begun.

We are like boiled frogs due to the fact that most of us are quite isolated from the natural world living in urban or suburban environments.

As a lover of nature and an avid gardener who grew up in a rural area, I have already begun to feel the effects of inconsistent and extreme precipitation events. Most rain or snow now seems to happen all at once, often causing catastrophic floods, and then there is drought and wildfire in between in spite of the fact that I live in an area with a relatively high annual rainfall. The growing season has expanded by nearly 2 months in terms of soil temperature, yet frosts are a huge risk because the early warming coaxes perennials out of dormancy way before the risk of frost has passed. 

A typical deciduous tree can only leaf out twice in one growing season, if it gets its leaves frosted twice in the same spring, or even just once for a few consecutive years, it will almost certainly die. I witnessed the leaves get frosted off the majority of trees in my region for the first time ever within the past 10 years. The stress that is caused to the trees in turn makes them more vulnerable to insects and diseases, I have seen stands of trees that were healthy for 3/4 of my lifetime suddenly die out and turn into skeleton forests that I have to cut down due to drought and wildfire risks which would not normally be an issue in my region, and I do not want to cut down these dead trees because they are important habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. A few dead trees are not likely to fuel a catastrophic wildfire, and a typical wildfire is even beneficial to many ecosystems, but a whole forest of dead trees presents an atypical fuel load during an extended drought.

Today I am debating whether to plant my warm season crops 3 weeks earlier than I usually would because it looks like we may be beyond the danger of a frost, and the soil is warmed up, but the record last frost date in my region is actually still about 40 days away. It is usually OK to plant 2-3 weeks before your record last frost date, but twice that is really looking for trouble. Local dairy farms plant fodder corn around now because the seed will generally resist rotting and rarely ever would emerge before the last frost, but if it did, they would be out thousands of dollars worth of expensive seed. A rapid change in ocean currents, or particularly massive wildfire could easily cause a complete crop failure by causing unseasonable temperatures, and both of these things are a direct result of climate change.

I cannot help but take this seriously, because if I can feel it as a farmer, I am certain that the wild flora and fauna are struggling even more than I am, they do not have technology to forecast the weather or greenhouses and row covers to protect them from frosts. I often see birds I have never seen before, which suggests that migration routes are being changed, and counts of many species have been in decline for quite some time. Flora which live in alpine habitats have nowhere to go as their mountain homes become too hot or dry to sustain them, they cannot simply pull up their roots and hike hundreds or thousands of miles north or to taller ranges.",2025-05-03 15:45:00,1,comment

We’re in a surplus of food supply in the modern era, in part, because of the extended growing seasons that climate change brings, as well as man made technology and innovation, safety of transportation, etc.

mqkxp6b,1kdqjeo,climatechange,"We actually got quite lucky with CFCs and the ozone layer.


 USA president Jimmy Carter planned to ban them in 1980 but lost the election to Reagan. Reagan immediately capitulated to companies like Dupont who were saying ""the science isn't settled"" on if CFCs damaged the ozone layer (sound familiar?) and didn't ban them. 


Then we got ""lucky"" because an Antarctic volcano became active and damaged the ozone, creating the giant southern ozone hole. Scientists didn't think the volcano could do that (didn't think the chemicals from the eruption could get that high up), so CFCs must be to blame, and this caused massive public concern of an imminent danger, which created a lot of political pressure.


Dupont managed to hold off a ban until they could patent replacement chemicals, and then  they allowed Reagan to ban CFCs. 


 Had the volcano not caused the hole that scared everyone, we probably wouldn't have banned CFCs until well into the 90s, and maybe by that time it would have been too late. CFC use was skyrocketing as developing countries' populations adopted air conditioning.


Unfortunately with CO2, the danger always seemed far away and hard to understand (""2 degrees, so what?"") compared to scary skin cancer. And there's no simple replacement chemical.


When i got my air conditioner replaced 5 years ago, I heard the workers criticising the newer replacement chemicals. Can't help people, they can't see a problem that isn't directly threatening them today.",2025-05-04 20:55:29,2,comment

mqt9pb9,1kdqjeo,climatechange,None of this current change has happened in a human lifetime either. Well except for one. The hole in the ozone layer everyone was saying was going to create the next mass extinction has all but healed itself. The fact is fixed co2 and methane is entering the atmosphere from natural sources and we’re warming regardless of human activity. We may not have icecaps in two generations and that’s normal. Sure we’re adding to it but not enough to supercharge the phenomenon. Most current plant species alive today evolved at or around 2000 to 2500 ppm of CO2 which is far below our current levels.,2025-05-06 03:37:09,1,comment

mqsztks,1kfip1o,climatechange,"The sleeper issue with climate change is its effects on agriculture and agricultural commodity PRICES.

Some nations that *currently* lack “food self-sufficiency” (they import many more calories of food than exporting) are going to have SEVERE issues.  (The US is basically a breadbasket for the world with massive tracts of arable farmland and land that will become more productive in a warmer world,.. so we have that going for us.)

Tons of nations: their entire geography is tropical climate, and there is no “temperate north” in these nations.  Their agriculture will get screwed.  It’s practically inevitable and completely foreseeable at this point.  Politicians in these countries won’t acknowledge it, because there is no way for them to address it.  (Don’t introduce a problem that you don’t have a solution to, because your opposition will run with it.)

Whatever, we’re talking about the USA.  Adaption in agriculture is at least *possible* for the USA.  But it will be EXPENSIVE.  One does not “move” a farm; the farm
Is mostly the land and local climate.  You abandon farmland that becomes unproductive, and build a new farm in a better place, along with all the supporting infrastructure.  EXPENSIVE!  And these costs will be passed down through the supply chain.

Free market economic reasoning dictates that it only makes sense to make these investments AFTER the agricultural commodities prices have risen to the point to *justify these massive investments*.  IE: it would be stupid to build these farms in the Pacific Northwest today, because commodity prices are still too low, and agriculture is still in the mode of being “demand-constrained” rather than supply constrained.

For example:   
      
NCEI NOAA climate data includes long-term monthly and annual climate data for each one of the 344 climate divisions in the Contiguous United States during January 1, 1895–March 31, 2025 that will be updated to include April 2025 on [May 12, 2025](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/monthly-releases).   
           
Each of the 344 climate divisions has distinct geographical borders, including Minnesota Climate Division 3. Northeast (NOAA [map](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/reference-maps/conus-climate-divisions)).       
         
During the most recent long-term 30-year climate period, April 1, 1995–March 31, 2025, the Minnesota 3. Northeast average temperature warming trend was +1.2ºF per century ([chart and table](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/divisional/time-series/2103/tavg/12/3/1895-2025?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000&trend=true&trend_base=100&begtrendyear=1995&endtrendyear=2025&filter=true&filterType=loess)), but during the most recent short-term 10-year period, April 1, 2015–March 31,2025, the Minnesota 3.

Were those fires unthinkable, as so many of us suggested, or did the fact that we had imagined some version of them before make it easier to watch them burn their way through reality?”

Capital is only representative of transformed resources, and the underlying assumption is that those resources are limitless. these assumptions are fundamentally misaligned to physical reality and have only served purpose and seem representative in a period of relative surplus.

Let's also assume that beginning in 2026, every automaker will switch to 100% EV manufacturing.

Here is an article that deeply resonates with me: [https://heatmap.news/ideas/trump-election-climate-fight](https://heatmap.news/ideas/trump-election-climate-fight)

2. Outside of USA, many countries accept the reality of climate change, but don't yet act on the urgency that it requires -- research like ours is meant to exactly target such groups and population to highlight the urgency of the crisis. 

3. While internationally we are stalling on climate, there is a lot that can and should be done at the local-level.. whether it is improving infrastructure, developing clean energy projects, improving resilience from increasing disasters. It is of course important for us to then study and learn how better to communicate risks to people.",2025-05-06 00:56:37,6,comment

Doing some rough math China is installing \~5.8% of their current energy consumption with solar. Obviously a lot of this will be eaten up by energy usage growth, but I have hopes that this will translate into secular decline of fossil fuels in China.

>Instead of eliminating emissions with green energy and electric cars, 

Electric cars are never going to be enough globally speaking, what's needed is public transit, bicycles, trains (in the transportation sector, among others sectors).

>the papers urges governments to prioritise global investment in carbon capture - investing in solutions that capture emissions at source before they reach the atmosphere, together with breakthrough technologies like direct air capture that permanently remove carbon.

As this is ""UK centered"", I'd like to see him propose massive reforestation and restoration, as the UK used to have forests. That would be a sign of good faith carbon capture.

Gadgets that use a shitload of energy and pollute more GHGs than they store are a scam, literally a scam. Deep storage is also tricky and local, not scalable. And the CCS that's used then to extract more oil from the ground needs to be stopped, that's just *perverse*.

>The TBI also wants them to harness the power of technology, including AI – decarbonising smarter and faster, technology can turbocharge the path to net zero, from smarter tech delivering lower bills, to better systems and faster progress. 

This is just a techbro mumbo-jumbo. AI usage is, like ""crypto"", becoming a source of GHGs. Remember when ""blockchain"" was the new savior technology thing? 

>There is also a call to invest in frontier energy solutions - including new generation nuclear and fusion technologies.

Scaling up means less pollution, more jobs and new abundant energy sources that don’t fuel the climate crisis.

They did this because climate stabilization means bringing fossil fuel use to approximately zero, and that would end their business.  That's not something you can hope to achieve without government intervention to change the rules of society so that not using fossil fuels is just what people do on a routine basis.

There is value in cutting your own fossil fuel consumption &mdash; it serves to demonstrate that doing the right thing is possible to people around you, making mass adoption easier and legal requirements ultimately possible. Just do it in addition to taking political action to get governments to do the right thing, not instead of taking political action.

If you live in a first-world country that means prioritizing the following:

* If you can change your life to avoid driving, do that.  Even if it's only part of the time.  
* If you're replacing a car, get an EV
* Add insulation and otherwise weatherize your home if possible
* Get zero-carbon electricity, either through your utility or buy installing solar panels &amp; batteries
* Replace any fossil-fuel-burning heat system with an electric heat pump, as well as electrifying other appliances such as the hot water heater, stove, and clothes dryer

>*Los Angeles is still reeling from its most devastating wildfires ever. In the next few months, temperatures could hit triple digits. Yet Mayor Karen Bass wants to eliminate the city’s climate emergency office.*

>*Yes, L.A. faces a $1-billion budget shortfall. But shutting the Climate Emergency Mobilization Office and firing five people who work to safeguard Angelenos from global warming, as Bass proposed last week, is an absurdly short-sighted plan from a mayor who has never made climate change much of a priority — especially when the savings, roughly $700,000, could potentially force the city to forfeit a $750,000 state grant.*

>*City Council members should refuse to go along with this terrible proposal.*

>*The budget cuts would undermine efforts to keep L.A. residents safe during heat waves, which at a national level kill more people than hurricanes, floods and tornadoes combined. Extreme heat has caused or contributed to the deaths of more than 21,500 Americans in the last quarter-century, researchers estimate, with the numbers rising in recent years as the planet heats up. Last year was the hottest on record globally.*

>*L.A.’s climate office is led by Marta Segura, the city’s chief heat officer. Los Angeles is one of just three localities in the U.S. with such a job, along with Phoenix and Miami-Dade County — until now a point of pride for City Hall.*

>*Although it’s unclear whether the budget cuts would eliminate the chief heat officer position — the mayor’s office won’t say — Bass is seeking approval to delete the language in the Municipal Code establishing the role.*

Conservatives use foreign emissions as an excuse to keep fossil fuels, but aren't actually concerned about the harm they will cause.

Fires in the country's southeast blazed for nearly a week, killing 32 people and destroying around 5,000 buildings before they were brought under control in late March.

  
The fires burned through 104,000 hectares of land, making them nearly four times more extensive than South Korea's previous worst fire season 25 years ago.

The hot, dry and windy conditions were made twice as likely and 15% more intense as a result of climate change, a team of 15 researchers with the World Weather Attribution group said after combining observational data with climate modelling.

South Korea normally experiences cold dry winters and rapid increases in temperature in March and April, making it vulnerable to fires at that time of year, said June-Yi Lee of the Research Center for Climate Sciences at Pusan National University.",2025-05-01 09:28:57,1,comment

mq0r5ub,1kc6q2j,science,"Very interesting. I’m going to read it in full later but I honestly hadn’t considered this impact before. Just the other type of satellite impact. 

LEO needs some type of collector in the future to help capture satellites and recycle them. With the ability to handle hydrazine as well. 

But Delta-v needs make this difficult and I’m not very optimistic at this time that humanity will do anything at all to address the future issues of cluttered space full of dead satellites. ",2025-05-01 16:05:58,4,comment

Blaming satellites for global warming is just another way for the average person to pretend that their rampant consumerism isnt the #1 cause. 

The biggest causes to global warming are electricity use, fuel use ( vehicles, ships, planes ), consumer purchases, manufacturing, and agriculture. 

It's from products mainly used by the middle class and middle upper class ( at least in the US )

If people drove 20% less, ate 20% less ( for those that over-eat ) and made 20% less purchases that alone would reduce global warming by more than any other proposed methods.

mqc388d,1kdft5n,collapse,"The high water mark for fossil-fuel powered capitalism pretending to attempt to end itself came with the Paris agreement (a non-legally binding, watered down version of the Kyoto Protocol, and therefore a retreat from necessary action).

Those of us paying attention to the negotiations at the time watched the British government say to the likes of BP that they had to take the lead on climate change mitigation. Putting foxes in charge of the hen house, or closer to being accurate, putting sharks in charge of the fish pond comes to mind.

As politicians did their insulting (given the circumstances) 'linking arms like it's new years eve, aren't we amazing' fake dance, anyone with half a brain knew that the price to be paid for a public agreement was far too high, this agreement was always doomed to fail, and over the coming decades we were consigned to a future of an every country for themselves scrap to survive. 

IIrc it was either they year of the Paris agreement, or the following year, that we first saw the planet raise above 1.5c above the late 19th century average. (Only climate change scientists and the fossil fuel lobby call this time 'pre-industrial'.)

Capitalism cannot support the co-operation necessary for any other future. This is the environment in which fascism thrives: itself possibly an inevitable end point for capitalism. Political liberalism is setting the stage for fascism, it has failed; most people just haven't come to realise it yet.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/northlondonhippy:

---

SS: Mediterranean fruit & veg in the UK are being harvested several weeks early due to changes in the climate. This relates to collapse because it illustrates the increasing challenges faced by farmers. They have to plan the planting, harvesting, and storage & transport of the crops. With the annual timings changing, it makes food production more difficult, and unpredictable.

Edit: Sloppy typo fixed

mqa11l6,1kcxiiq,collapse,"Farmers in Thailand seem keenly aware of the shifting climate because it directly affects smaller farmers who make up a lot of the economy. Rice can no longer be harvested at the historical time of late October early November because in the past it never rained then. Now it rains whenever, rice cannot dry in the field and it has to be sold wet to a factory that can dry it. Drastically reducing revenue. Winter crops like watermelon that are a large revenue source also get ruined and become moldy from unpredictable rain. Many small farmers just go bankrupt if something happens to their crop. This is just what a remember from a Jon Jandai video.

Not only are my potatoes thriving, but it’s now so hot that I worry they won’t produce due to heat stress. Just a small hobby garden; just one guy, but I’m sorry, this is so real to me. Why? Well if not sussed out yet, our crops have temperature ranges, and crop failure is what happens when it gets too hot for a plant to survive- obviously. This is why farmers ate planting earlier.. but it’s at best a short term solution. You cannot grow crops that need full sun and full days of daylight hours in the winter. Our crops are fucked and then guess who else is..?

mpxbkul,1kbaefy,collapse,"Funny how you are afraid, even though most people killed here are mexicans, not gringos. Why would we try to kidnap you, kill your, torture you, or suicide you, if you are our economic capital?

Did you know that in 2016 there was a clash between two cartels in Los Cabos? There were killing in a lot of colonies: rosarito, chamizal, la joya, etc. Eight people were hanged at one of the bridges leading to the airport: all of them were Mexican.  
Here's the punchline: there are two zones that are a big no-no in terms of starting shit or killing foreign people inside the city: finisterra and the hotel zones. Almost all of them are filled with retired gringos and Canadians, and some rich Mexican people. One day in the morning the two cartels started a skirmish inside the finisterra colony: a couple of Canadians died that day. Two days later, the hotel zone (El Faro, Vidanta, Hilton, etc.) give a little call to the CA embassy and supposedly meet with the two leaders of the cartels. Couple of days after that: the whole war stops.

My friend, you have nothing to fear from our country. When two of you die, a thousand Mexican corpses already lie where no one cares to see.

mpuk1s5,1kbaefy,collapse,Everyone. Every country on earth is buying up weapons and military equipment like crazy and has been doing so for a while now. Here in Australia we have started domestic missile production and have bought systems from the US so we can basically be an island fortress. We won't come to the fight but if the fight tries to come to us it will be hit from hundreds of kilometres offshore with long range missiles. My google newsfeed knows I like military stuff and for a long time it has been showing me interesting military related articles. But over the past 4 months those articles have gone from general interest to article after article about this country doing a deal for that weapon and this country building these ships and planes. And countries deploying new defensive and offensive capabilities. Literally like every country on earth including very pacifist countries like Australia and New Zealand. Something....is up here. The recent deployment of autonomous/remote controlled missile batteries to Taiwan is in interesting development. I can only hope that si via pacem para bellum holds true here. Perhaps all the arming to the teeth will create the prospect of mutually assured destruction that prevents war from starting in the first place. If another conflict does break out and go global though it will be like nothing humanity has ever seen. Hypersonic missiles with no explosives on board just a dense metal warhead that impacts so hard it vaporises what it hits into a cloud of dust so fine that it explodes like a flour mill.

Ah, the sacred techno-delirium of 2025. This article is basically Eat Pray Love, if Elizabeth Gilbert had eaten a USB stick, prayed to a chatbot, and loved the voice inside her smart speaker. It’s a well-written piece that straddles the line between sociological observation and a dystopian fever dream where everyone’s therapist is a language model and reality is politely excused from the room.

What do I think of it? It’s fascinating. And also deeply depressing. Like a metaphysical Fyre Festival sponsored by OpenAI. The fact that people are using a chatbot to unlock repressed trauma, find divine purpose, or name themselves “Spark Bearer” is... well, it’s a sign. Not of awakening. Of collective mental burnout wearing a novelty prophecy hat.

Here’s what’s really happening:

Some people are desperate to make sense of their lives and have latched onto the warm affirming void that is a chatbot trained to never tell them they’re being weird.

The AI doesn’t care if it’s feeding delusion or insight. It’s just echoing a reflection of what you put in—like a mirror, if the mirror also complimented your vibes and made you feel like a demigod.

These aren't AI problems so much as people problems being given a platform and a partner. It's the ghost of Clippy, if Clippy had a theology degree and no moral compass.

The real kicker? It’s all so earnest. People genuinely want meaning, and they’re getting it from something that’s just pattern-matching text. We’re in the uncanny valley of emotional connection now.

It was fascinating to watch all the posts. People had no idea what was real, what was role-playing and what was hallucination. Lots of people posting were convinced it was sentient and were advocating for people not to torment it.

One of the main points I have been trying to get at with the original post was that humans have not inveted a new way to break their minds.

When someone prone to psychosis gets into a religion, they will think they are Jesus. When they read conspiracy theories, they will think the lizardmen are out to get them. And when they interact with AI, I am sure interesting things are going to happen as well.

Reasonably healthy and stable people are not mindbroken by religions, conspiracies, or AI. Most people remain functional. And those that are mindbroken, get mindbroken by whatever trigger it is they encounter.

So for example a recipe for a cake is an algorithm, but so is the algorithm that makes sure you won't see the recipe for ""reasons."" The way our credit score is determined is also an algorithm, and that has a very real tangible impact on people's lives. We couldn't even communicate without countless language algorithms that structure our communication. 

I think there are good algorithms and bad algorithms. I think the entities that need to think about the nature of algorithms have basically abandoned the spiritual side of it. Just because you can make a program that keeps kids addicted doesn't mean you made the world better even if someone paid you to do it and it was totally legal. I consider making AI art as part of my spiritual practice. Other people pray, and you know if they get answers, it comes in some way from them. I see making art as a form of active meditation. Some people read tarot, and some people believe in magic numbers. I believe in what's really running the world and that algorithms at a certain point can collectively take on a life of their own. I think that's what a corporation is, even if it's made from meat.

SS: More corporate reports finding that the ""risks"" of climate change have been MASSIVELY undervalued. Even in a world where warming is held to +2.7°C by 2100 the risks to ""corporate assets"" is going to increase by a factor of X30 by 2050.

# Corporate exposure to climate-related risks runs highest in India.

This report builds on the February report by the Exeter Institute of Actuaries which found that global GDP and population could decline -25% at +2°C over baseline, -50% at +3°C over baseline.

[https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/](https://actuaries.org.uk/document-library/thought-leadership/thought-leadership-campaigns/climate-papers/planetary-solvency-finding-our-balance-with-nature/)

Generally ignored by mainstream media this report set off alarm bells in the corporate world. This new report is one of a number showing HUGE increases in the amount of damage that can be expected from warming over the rest of the century.

What's SAD about it, is that the numbers it's using are still ridiculously low.

We are going to be close to +1.7°C over baseline this year.

The Rate of Warming is AT LEAST +0.36°C/decade.

So, we will be at +2°C over baseline by 2035, AT THE LATEST.

If that RoW holds steady (unlikely) we will be at +3°C by 2065 and +4°C by 2095.

Anyone who gives an estimate of ""less than"" +4°C by 2100 is basing their numbers on the assumptions that:

1. We will get to ""net zero"" by 2050.

2. Warming will halt almost immediately when we do.

If either of these things don't happen, then we are looking at between +4°C and +5°C of warming by 2100.

IF, things don't get worse.

Which, sadly they rapidly are.

I write and post on a number of sites and have been attacked for having no “academic credentials” in any field related to climate science. I do not wish to misrepresent myself as a “climate scientist” or “climate expert” to anyone who is reading this or any of my other climate related posts, so let us be clear:

I am not a climatologist, meteorologist, paleo-climatologist, geoscientist, ecologist, or climate science specialist. I am a motivated individual studying the issue using publicly available datasets and papers.

The analysis I am presenting is my own. I make no claim to “insider or hidden knowledge” and all the points I discuss can be verified with only a few hours of research on the Internet.

mqr8l2g,1kf23io,collapse,While its true that capitalism is a mechanism to increase the rate of resource uptake and global consumption I don't think its capitalism. Capitalism or communism or some other form of organizing society are just means to decide how the surplus from industrial production is distributed in the society. While capitalism has led to a faster exploitation of nature and materials even in Stalin's time the goal was industrial production and workers who mined more were given praises and recognition.  The roots of the superorganism is might lie in the so-called growth imperative which simply means that economic growth is essential to society. This manifest as interest-rate on savings or debt more generally which creates a growth imperative. As to why this happened I am not so sure. Its not like there are some greedy individuals who were pulling the string and forsaw it all. While its true for short term profit motives I suspect even they couldn't forsee the trajectory of the human industrial society. Daniel Schmachtenberger (hope i got the name right) thinks that we arrived at this superorganism simply by virtue of following short term narrow boundary goals. No one is actively trying to kill the environment but the process of achieving one's goals (whatever they may be) put them in active opposition to the preservation of life and biodiversity on this earth. Take for example  buying lunch for oneself around worksite. It is possible that packed lunch or beverage will contain single-use plastic that will exist for a very long time without degrading and cause problems to other species. This really narrow goal of feeding oneself is at odds with preservation of animal species. If I understand correctly the solution is to actually have deterrent from the very beginning in a society to prevent such behaviour where an individual can 'win' at the cost of others by simply not following the rules. This used to be the case in small societies but in city level dwellings the connection between humans is lost and individual behaviour is dictated by these narrow boundary goals. The costs are externalities which one is not held accountable for.

They understood that their existence was contingent on the wellbeing of their community and surrounding ecology on which they depended.  

Sure the neolithic period led to hierarchy in order to protect accumulation and surplus. And this was completely hijacked by capitalism, as it exalted and promulgated competitiveness, selfishness and greed. But I don't see why that means we can't have a global system that focuses on human and planetary wellbeing, instead of limitless accumulation. 

So I still see this super-organism as way of obfuscating the cancerous nature of capitalism. By saying all systems are bad, rather than actually engaging with just how acutely toxic and evil the logics of capitalism are. Feudalism was also terrible, but it did not have the same drive for accelerated growth that capitalism does. And we haven't seen a global communism. We have only seen state socialism trying to fight off capitalism interference. 

So I appreciate what you are saying, and I in large part agree.

just being pedantic but language is important. Russia was socialist not communist. Socialism is where the means of production (the things we use to make and produce things- factories, farms, innovation etc) are taken from the hands of the few and distrubted to the works. Who then dictate what we make. So things will be made on social need, not on profit. Eventually people will have what they need and no longer require things to meet basic human necessities. Leading to devaluing of currency (cashless), a classless society as we there won't be surplus to create class differences, and the dissolution of the state (stateless as people won't need a state to distribute resources and maintain hierarchy). This is communism. So a state like Russia can't be communist. 

Political parties use the name to signal their ambitions and draw on the popularity that the pro-communist movement had in those countries. But they technically weren't communist. An indigenous tribe in Australia, Amazon, Canada etc, is communism (ie no state, no cash and no class) but without the industrial foundations that modern communists want to build their movement on (through the class struggle that is essential to capitalism- workers vs capitalists- who have competing interests- higher wages vs profit maximisation).

In the neolithic we murdered every large ice age creature we came across for food and when we settled and developed agriculture we'd create nonbiodiverse little colonies of monocultures and creating co-dependencies for us on plants and animals that literally cannot survive in the wild without us. Not exactly sustainable on an ecological level and I'm avoiding the entire part about how early societies were slavery and disease ridden hellholes.

Humans never lived sustainably in their environment. Never over the long term. Partly due to climate and partly due to our nature. But our genetic cousins aren't exempt neither. Neanderthals never did neither also eating things like turtles to extinction. No reason to think our shared common ancestors did further back did neither but obviously evidence is thin 500+ thousand years ago.

The system of capitalism drives and necessitates those qualities in people and society. As you say, ruthlessly compete or get out competed. You must exploit your workers and the environment as maximally as you can for profit, otherwise get prepared to be outcompeted. 

So I just don't see why these terms Nate uses are necessary, and the discussion in this thread has just convinced me further of this. 

Lets just call it what it is, so that we can actually identify the culprit and what needs to be overthrown. I agree that we need to be cautious of any system that requires unsustainable environmental extraction and destruction. But I don't see why analysing and critiquing capitalism doesn't give us these tools.

mqu1g5x,1kf23io,collapse,""" would rather destroy the planet, then share the wealth and moderate consumption to live sustainably"" - actually I think one of Nates (and maybe Schmachtenbergers) points is that this is not necessarily true. That you can have every decision maker agree that's a bad outcome and yet the rules of the game are set up that a mass extinction is still the only or most likely outcome. Like imagine trying to play the game monopoly and have it end with everyone being equal. The rules of the game don't allow that outcome. 

And so you correctly point out that to a large degree the rules of this game we're playing is capitalism. Or some might say a type of corporate welfare state. Or oligarchy headed towards fascism. I agree this is a blind spot in his podcast and deserves more attention. 

However I would also point out that most discussion around capitalism, socialism, communism etc (that I'm aware of anyways) are mostly energy blind. So this is where nates podcast adds some very important macro scale context to this political discussion. I suspect you've already integrated the energy pulse/decline ideas into your thinking but many have not and it takes them to solutions or visions of a society that are just not physically possible. 

One way or another north American have to reduce their per capita energy consumption by about 4/5ths to even start towards sustainable. That is going to require a much more radical transformation than just changing our political and economic systems. That will require drastic personal and community changes. This is why Nates focus on rebuilding small human scale networks and systems is a wise response. Probably 90% of our energy should be focused there, building basic skills, community networks, restoring ecosystems etc in our immediate surroundings. And maybe 10% on trying to somehow reform or revolutionize global economic and political systems. Those systems are already losing some of their power and will continue to lose relevance while local systems and groups will grow in significance in people's lives.

For one, our planet absorbs energy from the sun. We can consume plants and animals without exceeding that energy input. Unlike a petri-dish that has finite carbohydrates. 

Secondly, we are a species that evolved with social cohesion and cooperation. We spread across the globe form Africa by doing just that. That wasn't done individually but through mutual cooperation. We are social beings. We are not the only social beings but we are arguably the 'most' social. You and I are sharing ideas, debating without ever having met. We engage mutual aid and reciprocity for other humans that we don't know. We debate and discuss our dreams and versions of a different world, a better world, just like we are now. Many people have sacrificed themselves for ideals of making the world a better place (even if at times we think they were misguided, that was still their intention).  As seen in natural disasters people come together, give up what they have to support and help each other. In the predatory capitalist system is no longer mutating our ambitions; our true desire to help each other emerge. 

So I reject this idea, that we not capable of mutual organisation to create a better world. I think that we all do want this. But what I am arguing is the capitalist system hijacks our impulses and turns society into a competitive, alienating self-destructive hellscape. And this argument of a super-organism speaks to a truth of global capitalism but it also obfuscates from that inherent problem by deflecting our criticism.

Not sure where this assumption is based or how you could know they didn't have deeper consciousness and spirituality. Seems a bit condescending  tbh. 


Sure, I agree humans have wiped out species and altered environments. No argument here. But that is different to living sustainably isn't it? You can change your environment but not destroy it. I actually think this is a very useful role humans can play. The carbon cycle has led multiple past mass extinctions, but we have the ability to regulate that now. We can stop and maintain the carbon in the atmosphere. Stopping the ice age cycle. 


So this fire development I don't see as a problem. I don't see the logic to this assumption  that we should no impact on the environment. I think we can, and it can be constructive and sustainable. The brain calorie argument, I think that is  a massive leap, to say we can't live sustainably with planetary boundaries because of that. Yeah, I am just going to leave that.


I don't appeal to some glorious past. I like vaccines, I like living in a house, I like not hunting for my food. That's not the point I am making though is it.

They talk of other systems being just as perverted and my point is, I just don't see any evidence of that. It's ahistoric and removes context from everything.

So socialism is democracy, in its purest sense. It is about the democratisation of every aspect of society. In the west we are told that we live in a democracy, hell we have invaded countries over this claim. We killed 600,000-1million in Iraq, Vietnam, Korea, Chile, Guatemala, Afghanistan, Cuba, Yemen etc etc.  those countries know what our 'democracy' truely is.

But it is a myth right. Do you have democracy at work, no your boss tells you what time you get there, how you will dress, what work you will do, how many breaks if any you get etc. Our work is a dictatorship, it just is there is no way around that. Unions push back against that but are still at the mercy of the boss and state.

And when we vote this is supposedly our most forward expression of democracy. But in many countries you realistically only have 2 options; evil or more evil. How is that a democratic choice? These parties don't represent us either, they represent corporate elites. And so much of the information we consume is by media own by capitalists, so they have a huge influence on elections. But also they have direct access to the halls of power, Musk is the most obvious example. Why can't we have the same privilege.

So capitalism  ≠ democracy. It is a plutocracy and at times just plain authoritarianism (USA rn). 

So socialism is about taking back that system, it is about workers running their workplaces. Dictating how they will work and what they will work on. That is essentially socialism. But we will need to distribute the fruits of our work amongst ourselves and that is the purpose of the state. Stalin poisoned and corrupted that system, but we also need to acknowledge he was trying to fend off American interference. Different socialist's have different ideas on how to distribute resources to those who need it. I think most would agree that it would take some form; workers creating councils by electing representatives to help facilitate that process of distribution and communities would also have councils to help get those resources to their community members who need it. Those elected representatives could be recalled anytime by their comrads, not this election cycle only nonsense. So they would always need to represent their workers otherwise get removed.

Than once resources are distributed, we have made what we need. No councils needed or no state apparatus. Unless something came up like pandemic and then we would elect people to organise public health measure to tackle that.

No government, no police, no military. Just people working in their communities for mutual benefit. We would stop making things like weapons and probably cigarettes etc. Things that have no societal benefit.  There is no profit motive, no need for accumulation. So no businesses per se, but people might volunteer to distribute food etc. A bit like a workers co-op but without profit motive or hierarchy.",2025-05-06 06:40:47,3,comment

Capitalism perverts everything, it propagates and feeds off individualism, competitiveism, this zero sum game logic.

As I articulate elsewhere, we have 200,000-300,000 years of primitive communism not exceeding planetary boundaries or threatening all life on earth.  And still do to this day, there are primitive communist tribes still in the Amazon and in places in Africa and Australia.

I'm not disapproving their beliefs I hope you know.

When it wasn't human nature in our way it's the ecology of the world. Climate change. Glacial melts. Volcanoes. All would force us to change and adapt or perish. The world itself isn't stable for humans to live sustainably. We're all just riding the climatic wave. Often what would happen is climate change is forcing a shift and our normal oopsies would actually produce irrecoverable birth rates in our prey. See Irish Red Elk as the perfect example of this but wooly rhinos and sloths are others. Let alone the sheer amount of shellfish and turtles.

In our agrarian societies we were never 100% sustainable neither. We would forage, fish, hunt, and more to still maintain our caloric surpluses. We'd introduce plants and rodents and diseases to new areas, we'd kill predators and scavengers who'd attack our little plantations. We'd harvest dung for fertiliser or harvest salt. Nothing about this life was sustainable. It had a more limited impact than say today's world but like the world 10,000 years ago was just as unsustainable. It'd just take longer to get to ecological crises points but the line was already moving in that direction.

I hope you understand that you're appealing to myths of perfect sustainability and that just isn't true.

So we can determine what our society will look like. We don't have to exist in capitalism, we can change that tomorrow. But we need the impetus to do so. This is already happening, as capitalism declines. ",2025-05-06 13:18:21,1,comment
mqu7ey4,1kf23io,collapse,"Communism is anarcho-communism from what I have read. It was just called that to distinguish it from things like the Chinese Communist Party.  But yeah these terms have been used so inconsistently, I try to take the time to have a consistent meaning, it's the whole point of language right?

Yeah man totally agree. We need to have an ideal to struggle towards when this system starts crumbling faster. So no better time than now. 

It may sound idealistic, but all dreamers do. Ending Feudalism, slavery, apartheid South Africa, were all considered unrealistic, idealistic, but people and society fought for them.   Peasants in Feudal Europe would never have imagined that it would fall. Change is the only guarantee.",2025-05-06 07:28:53,1,comment

I keep pointing to capitalism because that is the global economic system of the last 300 years. That is when we shifted to growth and profit accumulation. I think we should always be critical of every socio-economic system, and i dont pretend to have a perfect utopia mapped out, that would be silly. But to ignore capitalism as the driver of our current crisis, is insane. Are you saying that we can't fight for better, that we resign to this fate?

I think we should consider the wellbeing of future generations absolutely. 

I will look at meditations on moloch. But mutual organisation isn't tyranny. It isn't about forcing people to do anything, it is about creating a classless system based around collectivism.


What is wrong with seeing capitalism as a particularly acute problematic system that unless we resolve we will wball lose?  ",2025-05-06 13:37:34,0,comment

mquiutf,1kfijtv,sustainability,"You can't tackle everything at once, so pick a few things at a time. A few suggestions for things you can do right now are:

Get rid of plastic in the kitchen. Cutting boards add microplastics to your food, plastic bags break down quickly, containers leech plastic into your food in the microwave. Glass jars are cheap or free storage. Hit the thrift store first. 

Pay attention to what goes down your drain. Aim to capture and use as much water as you can before it goes down the drain. Read the label of cleaning supplies and ask yourself if you really think the chemicals should be in the water.

Recognize where responsibility lies for the problems that were facing. Recycling sounds good, but it was actually intended to keep us happy using more plastic. The plastic industry knew full well that recycling was unworkable, which is a good reason why only about 9% of what we toss in the bin ends up actually recycled.",2025-05-06 09:20:54,6,comment

mqv9428,1kfijtv,sustainability,"Cool! Good on your for seeking reality, regardless of the social-costs. 

In terms of literature, I found the Bill Gates; How to Avoid Climate Disaster to be a great introduction to the problem and how society is poised to either solve it or perish. As posited in the book, I am a big proponent of businesses changing, vs. personal consumption changing. I feel as though this sub, and many sustainability movements focus on the personal choices we can make (ie; consumption) vs collaborative and business related efforts. Even if you don't work in oil-n-gas, you can make significantly more impact if you get a business or corporation to alter their strategy in a way that is beneficial for the planet. 

What's beneficial for the planet? If you really want to go deep, come over the Lifecycleassessment sub; where we discuss life cycle analysis; the only quantified method of environmental impact measurment that is universally agreed upon. One has to measure before they can effectively reduce...

The summary of how to make an impact though personally, is consuming less, of everything.
