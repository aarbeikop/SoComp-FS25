The IPCC estimate range for ECS is 1.5 to 4.5 degrees!  There are papers that put it at crazy high values, like double digits due to the (debunked) calthrate gun or the like.

As a practical matter, the world will likey use geoengineering to prevent warming beyond 4 degrees over preindustrial, should that become a possibility.","2018-07-13 10:36:14","3","technologyisnatural","1747897889.4137323","CO2 is good","manual"

Even if we continued emitting at the current levels for the foreseeable future (~100 years) we would come no where near 5C. Yes, we have 'locked in' a certain amount of warming, but it only takes around 30 years for the current CO2 levels to have their full impact which is no where near enough time for 5C of warming. 

Do yourself a favour and stop visiting /r/Collapse and read the IPCC reports if you really are worried. This is what actual climate scientists have reached a conclusion on. ","2018-07-13 13:51:13","2","unmistakableregret","1747897889.423256","CO2 is good","manual"
"e3b53ic","t3_936w9x","936w9x","climate","scientific","Yes, the evidence is overwhelming that humans are the cause of the current global warming. There is no serious academic debate about this issue, and there is no alternative hypothesis that explains the observed facts. We know that CO2 has been a major factor in natural climate change before humans, and that now humans are responsible for the present CO2 imbalance mostly through burning fossil carbon. The warming matches what would be expected from our CO2 emissions. 

Skeptical science is a good site for introductory material on global warming / climate change, it also has a good section that addresses the many denialist myths/talking points on climate change. 

[The Big Picture](https://skepticalscience.com/big-picture.html): The Earth is warming, CO2 is responsible, and we're to blame.

Human induced climate change happens in a completely different time scale than the transitions from ice age to not ice age. The glacial/interglacial cycles happens at a scale of thousands of years. To you and me any climate change induced by the glacial/interglacial cycle would be imperceptible.

Human induced climate change happens in the scale of decades, not thousands of years. IMHO the best way to illustrate the difference in time frames is this [graph](https://xkcd.com/1732/) from XKCD.","2018-07-30 20:57:56","4","Archimid","1747897953.8005052","CO2 is good","manual"

So the only way to max out this potential using trees is to plant them, grow them as saplings, then harvest them while young and bury them deep underground while planting more. Without causing emissions with all that planting, cutting, and burying. Doing a similar thing with simpler plant life such as algae that has a faster life cycle would be better, but the same emissions restrictions apply, otherwise you're wasting energy and time canceling out the effort.","2018-07-21 17:07:37","21","Rhaedas","1747898463.455022","CO2 is good","manual"
