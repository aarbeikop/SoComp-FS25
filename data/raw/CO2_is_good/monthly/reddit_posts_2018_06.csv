"8qnq31","climatechange","action-oriented","What is wrong with these arguments?","Until recently, I never read much about climate change other than standard newspaper stuff. I think I have heard most of the arguments for it. I've also heard people say stuff like ""everyone who actually studies/is an expert on climate change agrees"". Well, Judith Curry studies it and doesn't. As I read through this presentation, it seems balanced and well thought out. In fact, searching through ""climate sceptic"" sites on the web, I find surprisingly sensible-seeming people with logical arguments and data references. [This walkthrough is a good example](https://judithcurry.com/2018/06/12/the-debate-mann-titley-moore-curry/). So can anyone tell me; am I missing something obvious? Why are the arguments for climate scepticism wrong?

Any feedback is appreciated.","2018-06-12 23:31:55","9","99","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/8qnq31/what_is_wrong_with_these_arguments/","True","HCAndersAnd","1747896908.4949968","CO2 is good","manual"
"8qh2u2","climatechange","action-oriented","What positive effects would we see with a rise in average global temperature?","Just to start out, I hope we can avoid arguments here about if global warming is happening, if it is human caused, if the pros outweigh the cons, etc. and discuss the question. I hope that doesn't come off as rude, but these things get derailed easily.

That said, there's plenty out there about the negative consequences of global warming. What about the good? Obviously there would be local benefits in certain regions (and that would be an interesting aspect of international relations if we were able to intentionally significantly alter global temperatures one direction or another,) but what about overall benefits?

I've done a bit of research before posting and found things like net decreases in energy consumption, fewer weather related deaths, overall benefits to plant life and agriculture, ~~Northeast Passage~~ Arctic shipping, and an increase in 'useful' land. I don't know enough to judge these sources though, and am hoping to get some input from people more familiar with the subject and research.

If anything in my question seems to communicate a bias, it was unintentional. My goal was to be as neutral as possible.","2018-06-12 07:35:05","12","43","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/8qh2u2/what_positive_effects_would_we_see_with_a_rise_in/","True","Hatsuwr","1747896943.5168302","CO2 is good","manual"

"8tnx5g","collapse","skeptical","If you could prevent collapse what would you do?","I'm sorry the grass roots vegan anticonsumption isn't working quickly enough.  CO2 is rising once again.

What top down approaches would you propose to prepare the populace for the changes indicated in this sub?  And what can be done to enact them?

I think a third party in American politics is needed to counteract trump's agenda.

Off the top of my head:

1. Green city building spree to deal with high rents- moving the US Congress would provide a safeguard against FL aquifer loss.

2. Combining solar panels with the border wall.

3.  Carbon tax, good luck with passing through oil lobbyists

4. Electric vehicle grid

5. Desalination plants fueled with nuclear power- I hear Lockheed Martin is working on fusion

6  Rushing green tech R&D to third world countries by diverting the military budget:  A happy and well fed populace is less prone to violence and migration 

7.  Interdisciplinary working groups at Universities to be tasked with technical challenges of mitigation.

Any criticism would be cool too.  It'll be hard, I understand, it's harder doing nothing while preparing for collapse.","2018-06-25 05:08:44","0","35","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/8tnx5g/if_you_could_prevent_collapse_what_would_you_do/","True","rowdyrider25","1747897624.571984","CO2 is good","manual"
