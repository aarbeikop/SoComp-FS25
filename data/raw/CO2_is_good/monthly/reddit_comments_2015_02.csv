"coi1tno","t3_2viqtb","2viqtb","environment","emotional","I guess I'm with you. I basically do this for a living already. 

Do you really think that just planting can stop climate change? The Holocene era has been on this path before we kicked it up a notch with industry and modern agriculture. What are your plans? How are you going to go about it? Most of my work is mitigating the damage and managing reclamation projects. The volunteer work I do is a lot for one person, but will have minimal impact overall. So I'm open to ideas. 

I have personal goals for habitat where I live, but again, minimal overall impact.","2015-02-11 12:08:33","2","k0m0rebi","1747861020.7460246","CO2 is good","manual"

sadly, as einstein predicted, we will try to solve the problem by using the same flawed thinking that created it.","2015-02-12 04:27:54","3","PuP5","1747861020.7490249","CO2 is good","manual"
"coie187","t3_2viqtb","2viqtb","environment","emotional","I feel much the same, but why can't this be a part-time avocation while you do the world a larger favor in developing better solar power? Anyone can plant trees, but very few can design a better solar panel. 

And, yes, as someone who has planted thousands of trees, I know how gratifying it can be. ","2015-02-11 19:02:14","2","Splenda","1747861020.751025","CO2 is good","manual"
