At 21:33 you can see how CO2 levels are running up off the chart and temperature should follow.

The complete carbon cycle has other inputs and outputs as well and here is NASA's page on the carbon cycle.

""Carbon is the backbone of life on Earth. We are made of carbon, we eat carbon, and our civilizations—our economies, our homes, our means of transport—are built on carbon. We need carbon, but that need is also entwined with one of the most serious problems facing us today: global climate change.""

There are mitigation steps farmers and foresters can take in how they do their business, but at global levels, it will take vasts tracts of forest, cooked into carbon (like charcoal) and the carbon gets buried.  The exhaust gas can be captured and liquefied and buried.  It's expensive business.  It will cost more to put the carbon back in the ground than it cost to get it out.  It's more effective to just stop taking it out as soon as we can.   I'm dubious about the science because rotting vegetation puts more into the soil than carbon and that would be lost.  I think we would be trading carbon sequestration for soil nutrient loss. 

In your example, cement, metal and plastic production all contribute in their own way to green house gasses so that also seems self-defeating.","2016-10-06 23:16:55","2","StuWard","1747879550.4035125","CO2 is good","manual"

You should know that the mod team is united on this and that this decision was not come to lightly. At /r/Collapse we strive not stifle discussion on anything, while at the same time keeping the conversation relevant and from steering into conspiracy theory territory. During the last few months a user or users have been abusing the report button writing us at the mod team loving messages like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/ry9ltnV.png) from this thread alone. In fact, it's become such a headache that it forced us to take the approach that you are seeing now. It is not our intention to stifle discussion, but for rather us on /r/collapse to take an official stance in an effort to curtail what has been going on and to keep the content relevant. Like /u/babbles_mcdrinksalot has said, you are free to post about not buying into climate change in the comments and we will not stop you (assuming that you are doing so in a way that is in line with the other rules). Also, we do not like instituting unilateral changes to the subreddit without the input from those in our community. This subreddit isn't just for me or the other mods, but rather for all of us to come and discuss these things. If you would like to view the other reports we have been getting, please see them here: http://imgur.com/a/D6mwN

In all seriousness, much as I think climate change denial is a ""bad"" thing, I would rather it is dealt with by universally condemnation and an attempt to reason with the offender (unless they are clearly trolling when a ban is appropriate). Some of the best information on here is in those exchanges, and we lose them with this rule. Even if the offender may never be be converted to rationality, others will read the post and may rethink their position.

I have been on some online prepper/survivalist forums where the opposite view prevails.  They have created an echo chamber where nobody can be reasoned with and members will stay ignornant indefinitely.

Is that what r/collapse wants to be? 

My personal opinion is that rules on trolling and conspiracy theories, as well as the prevailing bias on here, should be sufficient to handle this. We don't need censoring.

Imagine then when we got to a point in economic and physical growth, where profits for global corporations and stock markets in general became so low, that it was more profitable to just strip the wealth (even enough that you knew it would kill them) straight off of the public. In essence this is how to profit from collapse.

This collapse would require a name that scared the public into giving up it's wealth, so whereas 'climate change' was used to disguise 'global warming,' 'global warming' is going to be used by the same people to disguise 'collapse'

So do I deny climate change is happening? I just always thought it was a phrase used by fools who never did anything anyway.

I think it's clear the mod team deliberated this, wants to preserve impartiality and encourage rationale/civil discourse on the issue.  I hope the mod team has the educational background and experience to analyze complex climate data studies, particularly their methodologies.  (Anyone got a strong background in statistics?)  How will you vet legitimate research from ""crap""?  I'd argue the majority of the subscribers to /r/collapse lack the ability synthesize such data into something they truly/intimately comprehend.  This is best evidenced by the comments themselves.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen comments cite a **single** warm/cold winter, active hurricane season, unusually wet/dry year as validation of climate change...That's about as fucked up as me spending a single day in Phoenix, AZ when it just happens to be raining and concluding it rains daily in Phoenix AZ...It most certainly does not.

That said, I'd propose:

1. Only restrict ""denial"" posts from organizations/scientists with a well established historical record of producing fraudulent and thoroughly debunked ""science"".  Such a list will likely have to be routinely revised as it's probably pretty easy to create a sciencey sounding blog or think tank, rehash and republish essentially the same misinformation.

2. **DO NOT** limit/censor discourse on the **effects** of climate change.  I think most climate scientists would agree there is a great deal of uncertainty to this aspect.

3. If you're going to censor poorly supported anti-climate change crap, apply the same standards to poorly supported climate change advocacy crap...Which often presents itself as little more than an emotionally driven rant by someone parroting something they heard from someone they think is credible that portends the apocalypse will occur next Thursday at 11:43 am.

Maybe you could build a rack to torture people until they submit to your belief system.  At least that wouldn't be as bad as killing people because of their failure to endorse your religious views as is the admitted desire of Radical Islamists.  

As far as your restrictions to peer reviewed papers or studies, you severely bias the debate because when most of the climate scientists are on the government payroll, either directly or from government grants to institutions for which they work, there is little that gets published in peer reviewed journals that contradicts the idea that it is the burning of fossil fuels by men that is the cause of climate change.  The CO2 induced climate change hypothesis is after all a political movement, not a scientific one, and when politicians and bureaucrats take over ""science"" what do you really expect the answer to be?  The answer is that the science is whatever supports the motives of governments and that is increased taxation and control.  Isn't the IPCC a political organization that hires scientists and even modifies their studies if they don't fit the hypothesis?  

Are you requiring that any post submitted in support of  anthropogenic global warming refer to a peer reviewed paper or study, else you will delete them, too?  

I suppose I shouldn't really complain about your obvious attempt to control peoples thinking without letting them be exposed to alternative views.  Whether you realize it or not, that is a big put down of the ability of people here to critically think for themselves.  If you need to filter thoughts before people are exposed to them, all that says is that you don't think much of their ability to reach conclusions themselves, and that also says that maybe you are afraid that your ""science"" really isn't good enough to withstand opposition.    

I can't help but be reminded of a Stanley Kubrick short story, set in a future authoritarian society where everyone had chips planted in their brains which transmitted their thought back to a central computer.  If someone had a thought unacceptable to what was allowed, an electrical charge would be triggered in their brain, erasing the unallowed thought.
