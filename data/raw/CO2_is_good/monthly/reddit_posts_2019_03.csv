I’m 16 years old and I’ve always been passionate of keeping our earth a home, ever since I was a child I knew how important and special life is, how special our place in the universe is and now that I’m old enough to try and help our home I feel like I should be doing more than I currently am (which is nothing). A bit of personal information that may help me

* I have quite a following on all social media platforms that I hope I could use to raise awareness. 
* I live in then United Kingdom, Scotland to be more precise. 
* I’m not really in a place to help anything out financially but would still like to help anyway I can. 

Again I apologise if this is not the correct place to post and if asked I will remove the post. Thanks in advance for any advice!

"b6ygq0","environment","emotional","The positive effects of a slightly higher temperature","I will cede the point that the carbon dioxide levels have risen much quicker than any time in history.  I will not however agree with the point that CO2  is somehow massively increasing the temperature.   there just isnt enough concentration of it to increase the specific heat requirements of our atmosphere by any meaningful amount.  I personally believe the increase in temperature is due to natural cycles of increase solar activity,  slight changes in the earths orbit, and the strength of our magnetic field.  (PBS Space time had an excellent video on it, you'll have to search for it)

But lets agree that it is trending upwards in temperature.   Is that really such a bad thing?     its a fact, and mandated by physics that warmer air holds more moisture, and that warmer climates have more precipitation.   As our population grows, we can all use more precipitation. This is clearly evident by the slow greening that's currently occurring in africa. A wetter warmer climate has had positive effects there.    Secondly, plants love co2! In fact many greenhouses inject co2 to increase crop yields.   More CO2 combined with a wetter atmosphere can and will lead to increased plant growth.  If you look at the ""design"" of the earth and its capability to maintain life, there is a good bit of negative reinforcement to stop things (like co2 levels) from getting out of hand.   Honestly, how much plant life would die stopped emitting so much CO2?    Honest question.   In fact hurricanes, these so called killer storms are one of them.  The oceans may get warmer but lets think in terms of BTUs (or joules if you want)... how many BTUs does it take to power that hurricane? Thats sucking all the energy and heat right back out of the oceans. Sure hurricane suck, and arent exactly good for the environment, but it is a natural mechanism.

&#x200B;

And ocean rise. Yes it is rising.  But seriously, its the boats!! all the damn boats!   (displacement lol)     Look at places like the aral sea.  The carson and humbodlt sinks completely dry. Prehistoric lake Lohontan completly baren.  The great lakes down a few inches, and the increase in hard non permeable surfaces that send water directly to the ocean. Dont forget the massive amounts of water we have pumped from the ground!   All this water has to go somewhere,  it can only be a few places.  In storage, in animals/plants, in the atmosphere, or  in the OCEAN.     isnt it a natural phenomenon that when you drain huge sea's like the Aral,  the ocean will naturally rise?

&#x200B;

Now I am not advocating that we just pump whatever we want into the environment.  In fact, I believe our biggest challenge is the health of our oceans. we need to clean them up, and pronto.  I also think we need to get a grip on genetic alterations before it gets a hold on us.  But I also know that as a race, we are doing a piss poor job of getting nature to work for us.  California is in constant drought, but during the last few years of rain, 90% of the water that wasnt absorbed by the earth made its way to the oceans.    Why dont we have pipelines from  flood plains to the desert?  The pumps can be solar powered!

Anyways, thats just a few thoughts I have. I do think we need to care for and nuture our planet, but I think alot of people are trying to push an agenda using unrealistic scenarios that arent based in the facts of the world we live in.   thats all. good day.

"b3py1c","environment","emotional","We are feminizing vertebrates and sterilizing ourselves with the cumulative effects of petrochemical, pharmaceutical and wifi demand which are all growing in Africa and Asia","The recycling program is revealed for the fraud it is. All our plastic is spreading throughout the food chain. I've even heard said there's micro-plastics lodged in our brains. 

Most Euro/American men will be sterile by 2050. Euro/Americans are more feminized than Africa and Asia. We are dulled depressed and sickened by our own air water and food.

There are maybe a billion Euro/Americans, so maybe 5 billion African/Asians. They are more young virile and male due to limited multiple exposures so far. China is building massive infrastructure to serve these markets, and those young billions will not be socialist during the boom phase. 

We can't flood the world with sex robots and drones. We are not going to live on Mars and big fast EVs won't change anything. After 30 years of trying, solar and wind are only 1-3% of the world's total energy use. 

We have to destroy demand within 10 years. When people say we got 10 years to fix the climate, it doesn't mean we got until the last day of the 9th year. 

It is not only PFAS feminizing species, it's the combination of petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and wifi in the air water food.

Every toy drone is made of plastic and trace metals. Every fitbit is killing the earth. Urban classrooms can be 1,000 ppm CO2 and filled with off gassing PFAS that are also found in drinking water. Herbicides rot your gut and pesticides make males infertile and mentally ill. Dow gave us this with their non-stick, stain-free, fire-proof, waterproof clothes and furniture because cigarettes kept burning down houses back in the day when everyone smoked.

Video time turns kids myopic, rewires their brain and causes them to become addicted to ideological fantasies. The pollution in urban air is like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, and makes us stupider. Urban classroom air at 1,000 ppm CO2 makes kids 15% stupider. Kids drink juice and water are filled with toxic metals, which make them stupider. Imagine how smart our kids would be without all this. Of course if affect poor blacks more than rich whites, but that's not what matters anymore, because its spreading to the rest of the world, and they're all the same race.

Wifi is a brand new experiment the human race can't give up. The 5G rollout will be like sticking our testicles and heads in a microwave. 

5G IOT AI WIFI is why China is buying up oil, instead of burning oil in cars, we can now turn oil into ipads and phones. Petrochemical demand is growing 7X faster than population growth. 

By assigning fake safe limits to everything we've ignored how much of everything there is everywhere, and their cumulative power over our evolutionary destiny. We can't escape our race sex class or even geography, but we can tax the rich without the government. Here's how...

I am a delusional optimist because I believe 100% private carbon taxes on the rich can fix avarice. By taxing the rich we can sublimate deep state surveillance/targeting AI into a universal basic income worldwide. Taxing the rich with 100% private carbon taxes means 100% of it goes back to the poor, no middle man. 

We have the computing power to keep track of every dollar on earth. This means we can eliminate tax havens, if we transition from oil security dollars to a world basic income. World socialism will take decades, we can tax greed in just a few years.

I am not educated, so if you are, then spread this topic, but don't expect any success, and lots of blowback. I know because denial is something I'm good at.

China will become the dominant user of petrochemicals.

I don't believe PFAS, pesticide, herbicide and pharmacide regulation is high on their list of priorities. Only by taxing the rich can prevent psychotic behavior.

Do you know that 3.5 billion people fly each year? That's half the people on earth. Corporations NGOs and governments have been fighting climate change for 30 years, and emissions went up 60% in 30 years. Socialism and capitalism have been at odds for 100 years. It will take 50 years for socialism to spread worldwide if we don't shut down tax havens for the rich. You can't put the cart before the horse.

Thiamine deficiency is affecting life at the top of the seafood chain including seabirds etc., and scientists don't know which pollutants are the cause, which also means there are other likely causes. 

Researchers also flagged increasing evidence of thiamine deficiencies in a range of taxonomic groups and in ocean waters as a possible driver of wildlife declines. This is especially worrisome how it affects plankton. We can't figure out if its pollutants or climate change or both.

Yesterday, over at /r/science, below caused a stir:

https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/b1415h/a_new_study_claims_earths_last_three_major_ice/

> A new study claims Earth’s last three major ice ages were caused by tectonic plate collisions that brought fresh, carbon-hungry rock to the surface. Over millions of years, these new rocks sucked up enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to cause temperatures to plummet.

I read the article.  It looks OK, but actually not a solution because it takes too long to suck in CO2 via that method (as stated by the article).  Then, this comment...

https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/b1415h/a_new_study_claims_earths_last_three_major_ice/eikjzan/

> 1 ton of olivine rock weathered = 1.25 tons of CO2 sequestered

> The rock, olivine, is not only the most weatherable, it is also the most abundant mineral on earth, making up more than 50% of the upper mantle. It is cheap, at less than $25 dollars a ton and could go way lower if there was more demand (right now it is only used in blast furnaces).

> The other amazing part is that the chemical reaction greatly benefits the ocean. It locks the CO2 in bicarbonate, which is then used by corals and other marine animals to form their shells, and when they die the shells turn into limestone. Another further benefit is that the solution is alkaline, so it combats ocean acidification and helps those corals even further. And if that wasn't good enough, another of the breakdown molecules is silica, which is the limiting factor for a crucial type of plankton called diatoms. Diatoms make up the base of many marine food chains and they are also under assault from climate change and ocean acidification.

The comment goes into more detail, and I did some Googling:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine#Uses

> Removal by reactions with olivine is an attractive option, because it is widely available and reacts easily with the (acid) CO2 from the atmosphere. When olivine is crushed, it weathers completely within a few years, depending on the grain size. All the CO2 that is produced by burning one liter of oil can be sequestered by less than one liter of olivine.

So, not just sequesters CO2 but also combats Ocean Acidification... and does other good things for ocean life...

Right now, my brain's seesawing between ""I WANT"" and ""NO, it sounds too good to actually be that good..."".  What about the CO2 cost of acquiring the olivine rock in the first place....?

https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/b1415h/a_new_study_claims_earths_last_three_major_ice/eil7hvs/

> Olivine is the most abundant mineral on earth, it makes up more than 50% of the upper mantle, the problem is right now the demand is fairly low, so there are no large mines. There are huge reserves close to the surface on every continent. Basic calculations for mine in the US that generates 5,000 tonnes per day, shows that the price would be $7.32, and can go even lower at scale and/or if it were done in a low-wage county. Also, what is cool is that there are huge piles of the rock sitting as waste on the sites of existing mines because it was on top of the rock (like that containing diamonds) that they were trying to recover. Presumably, those piles of ""waste"" rock can be acquired even more cheaply. The other cost is transport fees, so ideally we would find a beach to use near a mine or vice versa.

Folks, if you have the time and the interest - please look into this and tell me all the bad things about it, cause hope is definitely short-circuiting my upper cognition section right now.  *For the first time ever, I want to stalk a redditor...*

Oh Lord, maybe we can even use olivine rocks to control coastal erosion and slowmo land reclamation instead of those giant concrete tetrapods....

A [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1472-5) in 2015 emphasized the following fact:

>We then present empirical evidence for the role of specific fossil fuel corporations, including many of the 90 largest industrial carbon producers whose products are responsible for nearly two-thirds of all known industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1751 (Heede [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1472-5#CR27)). **We emphasize that more than half of all industrial emissions of carbon dioxide have occurred since 1988**: after the establishment of the IPCC, after leading scientists had stated publicly that anthropogenic climate change was underway, and after a vigorous and visible public discussion of its causes and risks had begun.

And the year before, the Union of Concerned Scientists talked about it...

>By the end of this year \[2014\], *more than half* of all industrial emissions of carbon dioxide since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution will have been released since 1988 — the year it became widely known that these emissions are warming the climate.  
>  
>I recently learned this startling fact from my colleague Richard Heede at the [Climate Accountability Institute](http://www.climateaccountability.org/). Heede drew upon historic estimates of annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing by the U.S. Department of Energy’s [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/) (CDIAC) and the 2014 annual update on the global carbon budget and trends published by the [Global Carbon Project](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/index.htm) (GCP), an international scientific research consortium studying the global carbon cycle.

Here is the Climate Accountability Institute from which that information was calculated:

>Since 1751 just over [400](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/graphics/global_cumulative.1751_2014.gif) billion metric tonnes of carbon have been released to the atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and cement production.

And more recently, the author David Wallace-Wells in his 2019 book **The Uninhabitable Earth: Life after Warming** writes...

>In fact, more than half of the carbon exhaled into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels has been emitted in just the last three decades.

If we add the roughly 200 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in just the last four years since that report by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, then the date continues to move forward marking when more than half of all CO2 emissions have occurred in human history. 1992 would be correct.

"ay080w","collapse","skeptical","We are following the growth, decline, and death cycle that any organism or civilization goes through","I have been studying environmental and sociopolitical news for nearly the past two decades as it pertains to the life cycle of modern civilization. We are following the growth, decline, and death cycle that any organism or civilization goes through when it finds a rich energy resource to exploit and eventually overshoots its environment's carrying capacity, this time on a global scale. Essentially all organisms will expand their population to the maximum that available resources allow. Environmental constraints are beginning to bite, outstripping our technology's capacity to overcome them. According to the study 'Limits to Growth', human population should level off and begin to decline around [2030](http://donellameadows.org/archives/a-synopsis-limits-to-growth-the-30-year-update/) with complete collapse of modern civilization happening some time around mid century. In *Immoderate Greatness: Why Civilizations Fail*, William Ophuls wrote:

“Civilization is trapped in a thermodynamic vicious circle from which escape is well nigh impossible. The greater a civilization becomes, the more the citizens produce and consume—but the more they produce and consume, the larger the increase in entropy. The longer economic development continues, the more depletion, decay, degradation, and disorder accumulate in the system as a whole, even if it brings a host of short-term benefits. Depending on a variety of factors—the quantity and quality of available resources, the degree of technological and managerial skill, and so forth—the process can continue for some time but not indefinitely. At some point, just as in the ecological realm, a civilization exhausts its thermodynamic “credit” and begins to implode.”

Nothing lasts forever. For modern man to have extended his reign would have required a herculean exercise in self-control and sacrifice for long-term gain and good —not a natural proclivity of humans. Notice that I said ""would have,"" because it is far too late to reverse what has been set into motion. The Earth cannot even begin to reach a new climate state until humans stop emitting the roughly 40 to 50 gigatonnes of CO2 per annum and stop altering and destroying global ecosystems. Climate change might as well not be real to humans because we have literally done nothing to stop it even though we knew it was real for decades and even suspected it to be real for far longer when Svante Arrhenius published [this](http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf) paper in 1897. The Fossil Fuel Age would not be stopped by any [scientific consensus](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-as-sure-as-you-can-be-in-science-that-humans-caused-climate-change) on climate change. There were profits to be had. The wonders of plastic were coming to fruition. And consumer capitalism was spreading throughout the globe. Humans even [reset in their minds](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/its-getting-warmer-but-americans-may-never-notice-climate-change/583570/) what they perceive as normalcy in their environment, accepting the ever-shifting baseline of anthropogenic climate change.

When renowned paleoclimatologist Lee Kump was asked whether comparisons to today's global warming and that of past mass extinctions are really appropriate, he ominously said, “Well, the rate at which we’re injecting CO2 into the atmosphere today, according to our best estimates, is ten times faster than it was during the End-Permian. And rates matter. So today we’re creating a very difficult environment for life to adapt, and we’re imposing that change maybe ten times faster than the worst events in Earth’s history.” Four of the last five mass extinction events were preceded by a disruption of the carbon cycle. All the conditions that existed in previous extinctions now exist plus novel new ones created by man, and they’re worse than ever. The stable Holocene climate which has allowed mankind to flourish is coming to a close and with it [we may be going as well](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/06/18/a-child-born-today-may-live-to-see-humanitys-end-unless/).","2019-03-06 15:45:53","57","31","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ay080w/we_are_following_the_growth_decline_and_death/","True","xrm67","1747909153.1585653","CO2 is good","manual"
