Nope, cowspiracy has highly misleading/false statistics. Livestock is not the number one cause of climate change.

Because it was never about the ""science""... It's about funding and/or the ""feelz"". Mass hysteria in populist science is nothing new.  Climate change just took it up a notch with a few 10s of billions in government funding.

>In spite of overwhelming evidence towards the livestock industry being the number one cause of climate change

This is blatantly false. If you get your info from populist documentaries... your gonna have a bad time.  https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/

PS, this is why people are not vegans. http://imgur.com/a/P8sxA","2016-05-18 02:17:20","1","FireFoxG","1747874791.4212413","CO2 is good","manual"
