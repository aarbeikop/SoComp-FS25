Let’s say I am wrong and you are right, that AGW is a total hoax. What do we get if we treat it as if it's real? Cleaner air to breath? Cleaner water to drink? Less pollution in the world? People using a lot less gas, saving money from going to Saudi Arabia? More people employed by Solar, Wind and Renewable Energy than coal and gas? Less coal miners dying of black lungs? Less Exxon Valdez and Deep Horizon oil spills? What is so bad about that? But what if you are wrong and I am right, the world will be just as polluted today or worse. And we produce less food. Farmers in Ohio and the Mid West already planted 28% less corns and soy this year due to the flooding. What we are doing now is more important than ever. Join us.

As the climate crises deepens, I'm finding myself more and more uncomfortable with how ignorant I am of the details surrounding it. I'm by no means a sceptic, but I'd definitely like to educate myself more, as I'm definitely naive to a lot of what is going on and being talked about.

Can anyone recommend a resource I can use to get knowledged up on the basics? I don't even know fundamental things like the actual science behind it, which countries are the biggest contributors, what policies are being recommended/introduced, the most effective ways to make a difference myself, etc etc.

I realise I can answer all those questions with a bit of Googling, but will obviously be lots of things I didn't even know I didn't know, so it would be good if there was a single place I could get stuck into. Like a 'climate change for dummies' type thing.

Like in any war, the first victim of collapse is the truth.

"cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","It is unfair. We will all die unhappy because 95% of the population is not aware of the collapse.","Inspired by this beautiful [topic by /u/Sabina090705]( https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ceum0y/i_flaired_this_post_coping_because_to_me_its_not/) I decided to pitch in my 2 cents.

I do not live in the United States, I am 10 years younger than the above user (30 yo vs 40yo) and I am afraid. But not afraid of the collapse, or of an authoritarian US or of the ongoing destruction of the planet. I am scared by the simple fact of being unhappy until death comes for me. My whole life I was a pessimist, you know, the typical dude “better be safe than sorry” or “it’s better to be prepared for the worse and be happy when it turns out well”, but never was I so afraid. 

I come from an academic family that is very politic-centric, watches the news and reads whitepapers constantly. In the last 10 years, I finished 3 master degrees, learned 3 foreign languages and started a family. In comparison, you may say I’m well off, no debt, no illness and a pretty nice “social parachute”. But that’s all lies. Lies told by politicians how well we have, how we should be grateful and enjoy the meme/movies/eating out. How we will enjoy our retirement. But I know that we current state of affairs, everything I do, like savings, being a responsible buyer will be useless in 10 years. To be honest, the grey mass of uneducated/carpe diem people that live by maxing CC will be far better than I am. At least they are enjoying themselves now and I in the meantime I’m worrying for the future.

> First small digression: I lived in Poland for quite some time. The current polish govt is pro-nationalist, is destroying the rule of law left and right, is pro-catholic, doesn't care about the environment and is buying votes by having a ""great"" social plan. Just to show you how Poland is fucked, almost 50% of citizens between 18 and 65 are not working, there's 4M of Ukrainian migrants in Poland and with an average salary of 3000 PLN net (around 800 EUR) the govt. decides to give 500 PLN per child every month. [My gilded comment about the current situation in Poland](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cb3yfo/poland_to_eliminate_income_tax_for_all_workers/etdpac7/). How do you sustain such a country when 100% of your powergrid is dependent on Russian Oil and  on the import of power from Germany and Sweden? You just can't. There's no plan to build any wind farm, solar panel farm or nuclear plant. And for some amazing reason, the housing market in Poland exploded (it's impossible to buy a flat) and every one is somehow ""living the dream"".

When I still had friends, I tried to talk to them about climate changes. That half of all the CO2 emissions were done post 1990, that rising temperature will have a cascading effect on all the power plants and blackouts will be frequent. The equator belt will be hit by such a heat waves and a wetbulb event that the ensuing African, Indian or S.Am. migration will be the downfall of the US and EU. Already when traveling in Greece, Italy, France or Germany you see plenty of Africans in the streets not working and just “being there”. Now imagine this coupled with a blackout, water crisis and crop destruction. It is an apocalypse. 

> Second Small digression, Referring to the above post in the first paragraph – I totally agree that closing and guarding the border is not a solution. The isolationism coupled with nationalism policy never worked and always sparked devastating wars. But accepting everyone is also not wise, we should be helping the migrants by having a plan.

Anyway, there are not enough resources to build all the renewable electric powerplants and grid to sustain the current energy needs of the world. Moreover, China, India, and all the developing countries won’t be so eager to implement western ecological rules. Drinking water shortages will be a daily occurrence, revolts and rebellions will happen every day. Do you see what’s going on in France? They have a weekly yellow vest protest for the last 6 months just because Macron wanted to RAISE THE TAX ON FUEL. I mean… sometimes I fell like living in on another planet (third disgression: [How many liters of fuel can you buy with the average salary](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8pc94k/how_many_liters_of_diesel_can_be_purchased_with/) France: 1457 liters, Poland: 699. And the French have the audacity to protest? Why Poland is not up in flames?). And I won’t even mention the epidemics, the rising sea levels, Russia trying to meddle into every country and create chaos [my gilded comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cbja9x/some_of_putins_top_cops_are_mobsters_even_kgb/etgcv3l/), the wars sparked by the lack of resources (read about the Indus river threaty and how it will impact Pakistan if India decides to reroute the river. Or about Sudan and Egypt) and the automation that will take our jobs. The capitalist overlords are just waiting for automation to be able to show better quarterly revenues to their shareholders. [John Oliver on Automation](https://youtu.be/_h1ooyyFkF0). About 8M of bread earners in the US will lose their jobs in the next few years. 3M truck drivers, 3M working in retail, 1M working in warehouses, 1M of office admin. That's 8M*4 (a typical family of 4)= 32M without anything to eat. That's almost 10% of the US. [Income inequality Vox video on 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xa9T2OMzmw) and [Curiositystream wealth inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caBDPFx2et4)

On another note, my grandparents were Polish (Bless their souls), they witnessed WWII first hand. I can still hear the stories they would tell me when I was younger. Of the time when my grandma as a little girl had to run in a field with her whole village because the Stuka’s where strafing it. And then a year or two later, to hide in barns because Russians were raping whole villages. Or of my grandpa fighting in the Warsaw uprising on ’44 as a young boy. War is terrible and war brings the worst in us. That’s why, our grandparents, when they came home from this war or the following ones, were not preoccupied with the climate change. They wanted the best for them and their children by building a home, having a car, being able to travel. We can all understand it somehow that the terrors of war were so profound that CO2 – something you can’t even see – was not on their priority list. 

But when the Boomers went on a crazy spending spree they left us with nothing. The minimum wage in the US should be 4x higher to match the minimum wage of ’60. It is harder and harder to find work because of automation. The population of every country is getting older and older and fewer kids are born. [My post about economiccollapse]( https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/ceenp0/something_to_think_about_the_current_state_of/)

And my hard to swallow pill is the fact that everyone around me is happy and I’m not. Just because I know 10x more than them I will die unhappy and afraid. They live their life, they post on Instagram pictures from Tokyo or Maldives, they are building houses, buying new cars and spending, spending, spending. Some of them will watch and repost a Vox or Vice video about climate change and that’s it. It is far more important for them to watch the latest Stranger thing or to badmouth a colleague at work to get a promotion. I don't have a car, nor a house, nor spending thousands on holidays. I try to live responsibly but I see it is pointless.

We are living in a dystopia where the whole society is telling us “work, save, and at the ripe age of 65, you will retire and travel the world” or “Study STEM, work a lot and retire early at the age of 40 or 45”. But what if you won’t make it even until 45? What if there will be such a strong recession or war that everything you saved during your lifetime will be erased? What's the point of working or trying to be a better human or trying to learn a new craft if everything is pointless.

Please, I really would like to bank on the fact that I know (knowledge is power, isn't it?) what’s happening. How to make enough money now to be still able to enjoy the last years that we have on this earth? I would hate to die in a couple of years knowing that all my /dumb/ friends enjoyed life. I was the one saving but in the end we all died thanks to them and their peers spending.

PS: the sad part is that the general population is more and more “woke”, r/worldnews is almost a copy of r/collapse. More and more people are being conscious of what’s happening, but they are still hopeful that we can change the direction we are heading. If more people are conscious then the collapse will happen sooner than later. More people will start panicking, sparkling rebellions and revolutions. So the collapse maybe sooner than we think.

"ce5m4z","collapse","skeptical","Does anyone else think that the aims of Extinction Rebellion are in fantasy land?","Although I agree with Extinction Rebellion on halting biodiversity loss and zero emissions, I think their aim of trying to achieve both of these things by 2025 is very unrealistic. 

Based on their demands, we would need to completely transform our societies in every way. We would need homes, businesses and agriculture, across the country, to stop the emissions they use. This would mean that: everyone would have to go vegan in five years, every business and home would have to stop their c02 emissions and work in a completely different way, it would require no flights and telling people they can't take a holiday on a flight once a year. I just don't see how most people are going to accept this radical change in life - especially in just a short space of time -  and that's one of the reasons I feel that ER is demanding something very unrealistic. 

Add to that; you have millions of people who are in poverty. ERs demands would mean that you would be pushing these people further into poverty. How can poor people afford organic food when they struggle just buying food? How can you get poor people to pay for solar energy or wind energy to power their homes when they already struggle with gas and electricity? It's these things - the societal impact - that makes me think the demands are unrealistic. This kind of shift would affect the middle-classes too. Based on this, I feel that their demands could cause unrest (unless they have a plan to completely end poverty, which they don't). Therefore, their scope is too narrow: they are only focusing on the climate and not on the way society is; we'd *need* to completely change society for their demands to come to fruition, and I just don't think that's possible in five years time. 

Then, their demand is to stop biodiversity loss within five years. Again, this is very unrealistic. We have a population that continues to grow and governments which continue to encourage population growth -  that is going to result in more biodiversity loss. Not only that, you'd have to get every government on board with stopping the destruction of nature within just five years, and that's not going to be possible - especially with the elected leaders we have today. 

Their target of changing everything by 2025 isn't going to happen. Their demands are far too unpractical to work in the real world. The reason why governments don't tell people they'll need to drastically change the way they live is because no one would vote for them. And this is what ER needs to do...good luck to them convincing people to ditch their lifestyle and ditch the only holiday many people get abroad once I year...it's not going to happen; they already annoy people just for blocking traffic. ER is right that we need to reduce our emissions and the loss of biodiversity loss quickly, but I don't think people will accept the drastic change that would be needed to meet this demand, I also think that the changes that they want to make in society (and need to be made in society) would take several decades to complete - we are not going to change the way society is structured within half a decade. 

Finally, ER doesn't address the fact that we've caused irreversible destruction, both to the natural world and to the climate. How can you rebuild rainforests which took millions of years to evolve, where we've created extinctions that we don't even know about, because of deforestation? How can you reverse coral bleaching? And how can you reverse the 1c warming we've already created? We are more likely to see 1.5c within the next few years than ER being successful. 

If we say that ER is successful in their demands for the UK, it's still nowhere near enough to prevent climate change and biodiversity loss when you have China and India causing damage to the climate. Suppose we say they are somehow successful in getting India to meet their demands - which is highly doubtful - they would never get China too; this is a country which is a totalitarian state and is notorious for its human rights abuses, the government doesn't even care about its people, so it's highly unlikely it's going to care for the environment.

There are so many things that ER doesn't address. Their position seems to come across as a kids answer in a school project on how to deal with the environmental crisis, it doesn't take the world as it is and the realistic challenges that would be faced in many ways for them; if they were to achieve this goal. They are viewing the climate crisis in a simplistic way that has a simple outcome - it doesn't. Itt doesn't have a simple outcome because there is no simple solution to dealing with this crisis. Furthermore, they don't seem to have any plan of how to achieve their aims of zero emissions and a halt to biodiversity loss. Everyone knows what needs to be done, that's the easy bit, it's a lot more difficult to implement what needs to be done in reality. 

Had society worked on it and changed in the 1970s, then we could have changed society, but it still would have taken decades to change. Many of us were already born into a world where it too much of the damage was already done. I think that's the reality that too many people can't accept or won't see.

"ck46c6","collapse","skeptical","Should society encourage suicide as part of the solution?","Human societies have traditionally frowned upon the idea of suicide. It's a taboo-topic, viewed as something negative, 'sinful', whatever. A person's close circle would consider suicide bad considering the grief it would create for the loss.

However, we have close to 8 Billion people on the planet. The lives of vast majority of them are dependent on fossil fuels in one way or another. The planet can't sustain that many people, this has become obvious. 

There has to be a massive mental shift in the society for the change and one important shift is about the topic of death. Nowadays death is a taboo topic, something people fear. But for the first time ever 'death' would be a positive outcome, a necessary sacrifice for the future of the planet. Should society encourage euthanasia for everyone, who would want it?

Heck, I myself am still using tap water, I'm using electricity, I will be using heating in winter. These are my big ""sins"" at this stage. I'm not interested in attempting to survive alone somewhere in the forest. What's the point? For the first time ever I'm concluding that suicide is the ultimate ""good"" solution in reducing the carbon footprint, which would be the best possible outcome for the greater good of the planet.

Generally speaking I still think the decision of suicide should be well argued, it shouldn't be used to as an ""easy way out"" in solving every life matter. Killing yourself on the back of every small problem which you don't want to face. However, we have reached an era, where the arguments that can be put forward in favour of suicide have become significant, and could be encouraged to use as a shift in the society in general. After all, I view euthanasia as a better solution than the looming resource wars, where many people would be killed anyway, but much more violently.","2019-07-31 05:44:34","25","35","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ck46c6/should_society_encourage_suicide_as_part_of_the/","True","202020212022","1747912495.7507157","CO2 is good","manual"
