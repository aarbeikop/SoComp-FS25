It is a misconception that natural conception is somehow preserving a blood line. The sperm only carries a haploid from the male, and the egg has a haploid from the female. The egg is X, the sperm is X or Y, so it means the male is also passing on some female ancestor traits when it is an X haploid. The description of what happens at conception is compared to a salt shaker and pepper shaker. Conception is like pouring a pile of salt and a pile of pepper, swirling them together. To determine what is carried on is like separating the individual grains of salt from the pepper and determining which order they came out of the shaker.

"e8alv5c","t3_9qkt88","9qkt88","collapse","skeptical","I understand your point but would like to respectfully offer two counter arguments:
1. Having a child presents the opportunity to shape the future. You can raise them with your values, to be respectful, to conserve, not to be a consumer for the capitalists. If humanity is to survive the collapse, and exist afterwards, we will need these kinds of people. While it might be seen as a kindness to this next generation not to birth them, it also robs the species of the opportunity to learn from our mistakes and grow. It's not our species as an innate whole that's to blame, but the economic systems we have chosen (for lack of a better word) and the elites that perpetuate it. It's not like the rich are going to stop breeding.
2. Not having children as a means of reducing ecological impact on the planet is, in my opinion, placing (too much of) the blame and responsibility on the individual as opposed to the governments and corporations that have a much larger, unchecked, often purposefully malicious effect on the environment. It's reminiscent of the argument to turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth to conserve water, as if that's the cause, and not industrial wastefulness or desert golf courses. We should focus our attention where it will have the largest impact.
Thats why I believe if you want to have a child, and can afford to raise one, you should go ahead. ","2018-10-23 13:07:35","3","ToppJeff","1747904727.2165349","CO2 is good","manual"

He worried little of worldly things as he paid for none of the children he made with an anonymous pack of welfare mothers.

It wants to undermine social bonds and legal restraints so that corporations can squeeze the most amount of value possible out of the people without facing significant unrest. It wants us scared, and divided, and happy to make do with crumbs like minimal education, ruinously expensive higher ed and healthcare, and so on. It's scared of provoking pitchfork mobs to eat the rich if it moves too quickly. Neoliberalism knows that the biosphere is failing, and doesn't much care -- that's a problem for a quarterly report somewhere down the line, and 90% depopulation needs to happen somehow anyway. Neoliberalism has been absolutely crushing it all over the place since the mid/late 70s.

The other faction is authoritarian, and it's more recent. It's decided that it doesn't matter if the populace get angry, because they can just be crushed. It doesn't think the pitchfork mobs are a real threat, and it thrives on chaos and division. It's psychopathic at heart, and one of the more interesting things about psychopathy is that it lives in the moment, with no real thought of consequence. It moves much more quickly than neoliberalism, and it's doing really well at the moment. Trump, Putin, MbS and Premier Li are leading figures. Hungary, Italy and Poland are all sliding this way fast, and Brazil might be about to become the latest recruit.

The EU is staunchly old-school Neoliberal, and it's not alone in that. Macron, Merkel, Obama and Trudeau are the Neolib poster children -- people who can smilingly and compassionately ravage countries and destroy the lives of the unfortunate and still smell of roses thanks to their great charm and wonderful PR. 

So you're absolutely right not to trust the EU -- they're a pack of charming poisoners, slipping arsenic into the champagne flute they're handing you.

Brexit, however, is an authoritarian construct. Cameron didn't expect it to win -- and neither did Boris, for all his long-standing anti-EU parasitism. But the leave campaign had the benefit of vast amounts of propaganda, both open and covert, funded through that genuinely traitorous asshat Farage, and the contemptibly hate-obsessed DUP. Strands of that money have been repeatedly traced back to Russia, including direct donations from Russia to May.

The Brexit strategy that the authoritarians want is a no-deal crash. No adjustment period. No backstop. No restraint. Nothing but chaos. This has the dual benefits of damaging the EU, making it easier for the authoritarians to snatch it from the neoliberals, and also permitting London to stay as the major money-laundering hub for Russian dark money. We currently wash hundreds of billions a year for the kleptocrats alone. Dark-money analysts suspect Putin of being the actual richest man on Earth. If Britain (or, more likely, just England) gets washed down the pan into third-world status as part of the process, that's our just desserts for the hell we dished out over the last 300 years.

May was the only person vicious and power-craving enough to blight the UK for the authoritarians, which is why she alone survived the post-vote Week of Long Knives. It's why all her suggestions to the EU for a deal have hinged on the UK retaining some of the EU's core ""six freedoms"", but not all of them -- the EU is required, by its own founding treaties, to keep the six undivided. No deal is ever going to be possible on that basis. 

No deal is great for May. She gets to blame labour, her own rebels, the EU, everyone, all the while making damn sure that the UK collapses out of all its foreign trade, then when the chaos turns nasty (in about 72 hours after no-deal exit), declares a state of emergency, suspends parliament, and takes over for as long as she can keep her withered claws sunk into England's carcass. (The Scots, Welsh and Irish can go hang as far as she's concerned.) That's her game-plan.

Boris has other ideas. The Neolibs are attempting to fight back and get some sort of less-damaging outcome, but their own past strategies are hampering them greatly. Divide and Conquer is the Neolib motto, and Boris -- who is frighteningly clever beneath that facade -- has been on that team for years. That's why he's been so dedicated about smearing the EU for so long. Divide, divide, divide. But that is fuel the authoritarians can run on, too. So at the moment, he's trying to seem hard Brexit enough to woo the frothing hard-right (and hard-left) loons into letting him take over, and then he wants to try to salvage something, but he's up against a very wily, well-financed opposition with fantastic propaganda skills. Besides, the DUP will joyfully crash the current government entirely if the conservatives look like pulling back from a no-deal, so the MPs are scared to side with him. He's fighting a losing battle.

>I'm sorry if it's not completely on topic for the sub.

But it is. You may not even be aware of how on topic it is. Very, very few are.

>His name was Boris Johnson.

You summarize quite accurately what he was doing before Brexit and how he helped leading to it but you don't mention what he did \*before\* that and how that is, imho, a significant driver for his position regarding the EU and Brexit.

>Leaving the EU will definitely be a short term disaster for the UK, but that still leaves the question ""what will remain bring? Might that also be a disaster over a slightly longer term""?

You are touching a key point here, which continues on

>Egypt, Turkey and Iran have enormous populations, all within relatively easy migration range. What will happen to the populations of these countries when they become desolate, due to a combination of high temperatures, lack of water, warfare and collapse of local economies? Can the EU withstand the potential migration of hundreds of millions?

But you still don't tie these together. While it's all quite obvious if you make the ropes a little longer so it's easy to tie them into a knot. So here's my reasoning:

&#x200B;

First of all, Boris Johnson studied Classics. he published about the Roman Empire and compared it to the EU. He's also acutely aware of how and the why (or possible why combinations) the Roman Empire collapsed.

Secondly, you mention climate migration from outside of Europe but what about \*inside\* of it? How long will it take for the South and Central of Spain, or Italy, south of France etc to suffer to such an extent big swatches of the population will decide 'up North' is a better plan? The four freedoms of the EU are 'free movement of goods, services, capital and persons'. And if you've paid attention, the only thing that's the real issue is the 'persons' part. Brexiters or no, they prefer free movement or as free as possible of goods, services and capital (especially capital, City of London and all), just not people. Because the UK as a whole and Scotland in particular is globally relatively buffered against the worst effects of climate change. (An interesting link here is the desperate insistence to keep Scotland in the UK, but that's beyond this reply). Scotland sits in the 'open door' of the refrigerator called Greenland. Look at any map. So what is the UK going to do with millions and millions of Spanish and French and Italian people who've seen those same maps and arrive because they can use their freedom: free movement of people? In that perspective the UK just gotta get rid of this freedom while trying to hang on the others as much as they can, which will decide how hard or soft Brexit it's gonna be.

&#x200B;

Boris Johnson presents himself as a harmless buffoon but I think that's all fake. I think he knows what he's doing and also why. I also don't think governments (or more specifically, the mandarins that hold the positions and information independent of who's elected last time) are as willfully ignorant of climate change as they appear. And so this entire Brexit thing is also or perhaps even mainly about how this nation is subtly preparing for a climate change (collapse) scenario they'd ignore or even deny in public. Now, who else is? And how?

It seems unlikely that the EU would have agreed to that either without still trying to fuck us over and make an example of us to keep their failing coalition alive though.

Most governments tend to be full of complete arseholes because those are the only people who would actually want the job but the EU is just arseholes all the way down. Having to follow ridiculously poorly conceived rules that they come up with in Brussels that we ultimately have no say in is not how a system should work. I think other countries in Europe know this better than us because whilst they agree to them they often don't even bother to enforce them when they clearly aren't in the public interest.

"e85dvdz","t3_9pyai8","9pyai8","collapse","skeptical","I think EU is being weakened with the UK exit. We need it to collapse so there is no standards and no competition with the dollar. I researched this topic extensively and thought it was incredible that the UK was able to push this topic to a simple referendum. There are no safeguards or limits to these referendum. No second vote no large majority to make monumental changes to the country. Its as if it was planned in the long term. You guys did have another referendum in the past on this same issue. Good luck. 

You are confused because that is how propaganda works. At least you are not so brainwashed you wanted brexit without actually researching the effects. Remember UK has been part of the EU for decades. A hard exit is going to really hurt UK’s trade. There are numerous treaties the EU is part of with other member states, so all those favorable trade practices will have to be renegotiated. I checked the statistics and young people, who will enjoy the brexit effects, did not vote nearly as much as old farts. 

I believe you guys are following our plan excellently. You can’t have all pros in all situations. Africa would love to have a trade bloc, but the guy who asked for this was assassinated and his state became a failed state. Latin america would love it too, but standards for working people, health care? No, you should only get paid and you go home. Let others be concerned about climate change.

Welcome to American politics!

Learn something new every day, this is considered right wing in the UK.  It's left or moderate in the US.

Same players being the bad guys' in the US...me thinks n international cabal is playing the nations against one another...the whole Russian thing sounds like pure fantasy though...here and there.

So typical politics eh?

> Many of the tactics used by Brexit campaigners are reminiscent of those of Trump, and it's not by accident that figures such as Steve Bannon have visited our shores.

Trump thinks so little of the U.K. he mad eth queen follow him and assessed her soldiers for her.  I doubt he had anything to do with your internal issues.

> The EU was initially founded in the aftermath of the second world war in order to promote peace and trade between European countries.

And here I thought it was a late 80's or early 90's thing that was dying and almost over with...pity me, I am not well educated on international issues.

> However we are entering a new era with an extremely different challenge. Instead of wanting to maximise growth we want to limit it and focus on sustainability. Is capitalism still the best system for this new goal? 

I know for a fact that is NOT everyone's goal, so who is this we you speak of?

> Political parties have learnt that all you need to do to win an election is to focus on a few marginal ""swing"" constituencies, which massively amplifies the effects of campaign spending whilst effectively disenfranchising the vast majority of the population that don't live in swing states / constituencies.

Laughing now, the left makes the same argument here.  If you look at the MAP of who voted for Trump, geographically, it was most of the US.  It was made that way on purpose.  BTW, the US is NOT a democracy, it is a Republic if we can keep it.  

> In the states we can see this with the growing power of federal government at the expense of the states,

Which Trump is reversing, just saying.  

> Which brings us to the nature of politics in the EU. It's a complicated system and most people only have a vague understanding. There are three main decision making bodies - the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission, each with different powers. Only one of these bodies is directly elected.

That there is a problem, only one body is elected? That sounds like rule from on high to me.

> So if voters don't know who they're voting for, and don't know which policies they are voting for, then is it really a democracy?

In a demcracy you do not vote for someone to represent you.  You vote what you want.

>  What if the only way to avoid collapse is for us to all become poorer, to voluntarily lower our standard of living, not just for a single parliamentary term, but indefinitely? 

What does voting do for this?  Just stop working and go on benefits.  There problem solved.

> We have already seen it treat Greece extremely badly in the wake of its recent financial disasters. An independent country in a similar position would have simply declared bankruptcy and got on with trying to rebuild its economy starting from a lower level.

Yes, like Iceland did.  Now they are fine and Greece is screwed.

> So what will happen in the future if there is another financial crisis? What if a major economy, such as Spain or Italy, finds itself in similar difficulties? Could the Euro even endure? It seems doubtful to me.

There will be another.  Italy will probably fucking go.  The Euro will be trashed.  

> Can the EU withstand the potential migration of hundreds of millions? In some ways I feel sorry for the immigrants of recent years, such as those from Syria. They are just ordinary people trying to survive in a hostile world, and in many ways demonised by the right.

Have you read the number of rapes in Sweden lately...?  It's all facts man.  Demonized hell...they try to cover up the shit the migrants do to keep the numbers low.  

> If we believe that the states nearby will collapse then at some point we need to say ""No"" in order to defend ourselves, and that is easier done sooner than later.

Yep.

>  So I feel like I'm obligated to take a side on the issue, but I can neither agree with the machinations of the right, or the liberal capitalist utopianism of the centre left. So I'm left in a limbo, unable to explain my position to those around me on one of the most important topics of the day without writing a two thousand word essay.
