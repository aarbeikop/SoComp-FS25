Mann, Dr. Robert Bullard, and Ploy Achakulwisut. Ask us anything about the Peoples Climate March, climate science and why we march!","On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, people will come together from across the United States in the streets of Washington D.C. to resist attacks on people, communities and our planet. We invite you to join the Peoples Climate Movement on Saturday, April 29th as we march to:

  *   Advance solutions to the climate crisis that are rooted in racial, social and economic justice and committed to protecting front-line communities and workers.

  *   Protect our right to clean air, water, land, healthy communities and a world at peace.

  *   Immediately stop attacks on immigrants, communities of color, indigenous and tribal people and lands and workers.

  *   Ensure public funds and investments create good paying jobs that provide a family-sustaining wage and benefits and preserve workers’ rights, including the right to unionize.

  *   Fund investments in our communities, people and environment to transition to a new clean and renewable energy economy that works for all.

  *   Protect our basic rights to a free press, protest and free speech.


My name is Michael E. Mann. I use theoretical models and observational data to better understand Earth's climate system. I’m perhaps past known for the so-called “The Hockey Stick” curve that my co-authors and I published in the late 1990s, which has become iconic in the public discourse human-caused climate change. The Hockey Stick quickly became a central object of attack by those looking to discredit the case for concern over human-caused climate change.  As I describe in my book ‘The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars’, many of attacks have been directed at me personally, in the form of threats and intimidation efforts carried out by individuals, front groups, and politicians tied to fossil fuel interests. I use my personal story as a vehicle for exploring the role of skepticism in science, the uneasy relationship between science and politics, and the dangers of special economic interests to skew discourse over policy-relevant areas of science.


I’m Dr. Robert Bullard. Some often describe me as the father of environmental justice. I have written eighteen books that address climate justice, environmental racism, and regional equity among many things. I have testified as an expert witness and served as a technical advisor on hundreds of civil rights lawsuits and public hearings over the past three decades.


I’m Ploy Achakulwisut. I'm a PhD candidate in Atmospheric Science. My research focuses on improving our understanding of the interactions between climate change and atmospheric chemical composition, important for climate and human health. Currently, I'm investigating how future climate change will affect levels of airborne dust in the western US. I'm also interested in climate policy, communications, and activism. I was a SustainUS Youth Delegate to the 2014 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru. For the past four years, I've co-organized several campaigns to mobilize scientists to engage in climate advocacy.

**UPDATED (1:00pm ET):** That’s our time for today and so we’re signing off. Thanks everyone for the great questions. We really enjoyed them and we hope our answers were helpful. Keep the conversation going here and on Twitter and Facebook. We’ll see you at the march!
