"31891t","climatechange","action-oriented","Fossil Fuel Fact: 1 kWh useful energy = 1 MWH global warming. Why are we doing this, and not doing that?","Every time you burn fossil fuel, you add CO2 to the atmosphere that traps more heat energy onto the earth because CO2 is a GHG. Within a year, the CO2 from roughly 1 kWh of fossil fuel burnt will trap an additional 1 kWh of heat via atmospheric warming. The CO2 will continue to trap heat for 1,000 years, trapping a total of 1 MWH of energy for every 1 kWh of energy that you actually use today.

These numbers I've just stated are rule of thumb numbers. I'm sure some will want to argue about the way the calculation is done and try to poke holes in it. Before you do that, I suggest doing your own calculation. Sure, some fossil fuels emit less CO2 for the useful energy they provide. Some of CO2 gets absorbed by the ocean. So, the conclusion you come to if you do your own calculation may be off of this rule of thumb by a factor of 2 or 3 either way - but I doubt that its more that that. Also, these assumptions do not include runaway scenarios like changing the earths albedo, killing off the rain forest, or methane hydrate release. That's not the point. The point is this: Why in the world would anyone want to continue down this path where we do 1,000 times more harm than good in the long run? Shouldn't we hurry up and find a way to remove the CO2? Haven't we mortgaged enough of the future already?

"336c2r","climate","scientific","What would happen to the climate if -hypothetically- ocean desalination was sustainable and thus 'free', and the deserts would become fertile?","I was thinking: Desalination of the oceans is too costly right now, and unsustainable. If, however, the energy/$ cost of desalination becomes so low that it can be abundant,  and water would get everywhere limitlessly, so that we could plant crops all over desert areas that are right now way too arid -- what would happen?

Would more carbon be taken out of the atmosphere and would we solve the problem of CO2 levels? Would we get too much oxygen? Would the climate change because there would be too much water vapor in the atmosphere?

I'd like to hear your thoughts. Especially from people who work/study in the field!","2015-04-19 23:29:14","2","4","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/336c2r/what_would_happen_to_the_climate_if/","True","Andromeda2803","1747863125.471887","CO2 is good","manual"
"32vliv","environment","emotional","How to argue with global warming deniers.","Bit of a rant here sorry: Today I was having a conversation with a few people when the topic of global warming came up. I strongly believe it is a huge problem for our planet, but the others completely denied it. They kept saying ""the oceans have not warmed,"" ""computer models can't predict anything,"" ""people only hear global warming is happening because the only studies that get published are the ones that happen to support their argument,"" and other ideas such as that. I HATE arguing. I am not good at it, and I am not able to effectively communicate my ideas in situations where people are arguing against me. So I just sat their and smiled while they were telling me one day I will mature and understand why I am wrong, and the rage was just boiling up inside me. They were pissing me off immensely, and I couldn't bring myself to say anything back. What can I do next time to be better prepared for idiots like this.

"340def","environment","emotional","Growing Nature in Barren Environments??","So i have an idea that i would like help developing and generating ideas to help become a reality. My idea is to re-grow a forest in places that are barren like deserts and arid environments to help absorb CO2 emissions to replace and supplement disappearing forests. But the question is how? Where do we begin and how do successfully we grow life in a place without life? 

i have an idea to grow in a greenhouse but i dont know much about them or if that's a good idea... any opinions or help?","2015-04-27 08:28:35","4","7","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/340def/growing_nature_in_barren_environments/","True","amcadena","1747863210.7240772","CO2 is good","manual"
