"48sr9y","climate","scientific","Can you tell me how each part of the electromagnetic spectrum affects the climate, and the parts of our atmosphere that interact with it? (more inside)","I'm a climate activist, and I know a good deal about climate change.

But I have a climate change denying friend who is getting his masters in nuclear engineering, so he thinks he knows what he's talking about.

I'd like an overall summary of things but first question:

CO2 traps heat in our atmosphere, right? Is this as infrared light? This is what I assumed. But what's going on?

I'm 99% sure the hole in the ozone layer has nothing to do with climate change but my friend tried telling me something about how UV rays are stronger than infrared, so therefore it has more of an effect on the climate. What's going on here?

And what can you tell me about gamma and x-rays from space? What's stopping these from penetrating our atmosphere? My friend says that because they're much stronger they have far more of an effect on climate change.

My friend said something about how the sun is causing climate change but we didn't go into further detail.

Thank you very much!","2016-03-03 16:40:00","3","5","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/48sr9y/can_you_tell_me_how_each_part_of_the/","True","novelty_Poop_Corn","1747873150.0161521","CO2 is good","manual"
"4b4vex","environment","emotional","What's the problem with sequestering CO2 individually, by simply burying plant matter in a box? Over a lifetime, of course.","So, as most of you know, CO2 only makes up 4 liters of a 1m^3 box. But that's in gas form. In *solid* form it's much less.

This means that on some level, it should be possible to ""individually sequester"" all the *extra* CO2 we release into the atmosphere. We just need a number, say, 2 tons (2000kg), that needs to go into the ground again.

How is amassing 2 tons of dried, compressed plant matter over a lifetime and burying it in a sealed concrete box an impossible task? Especially if you make up milestones on a year-by-year basis. You could literally put carbon back into the ground using grass if you wanted (though I'd say that's not that efficient).

The problems all seem manageable. Gathering plant matter, which is basically carbon (CO2) in solid form, is a cinch. Just grow it and then don't let it rot, because that would mean it releases the CO2 back into the atmosphere again. You simply have to dry it and *not put it on the ground outside*. How hard can that be?

The other problem is to bury it in a box that won't open for 1000+ years, as long as it's not dug up. Cement comes to mind, and I guess it'd take a lot to cover all the people in a society. But it doesn't seem impossible, *at all*.

Practically it probably wouldn't play out like this, but instead you'd get a ""carbon debt"" kind of like your student debt, that you have an obligation to pay off before you exit this world. Taxes would probably take care of it, and it probably wouldn't even need a lot if you industrialize this process.

Imagine a non-profit, government owned, factory that does this and only this. They can use whatever plant matter they get a hold of. Grass, weed, trees they cut down, tree matter left from any tree industry that's not used. There's *bound* to be a lot. Even trash in the form of plastic should qualify.

You pay these guys taxes to mass-produce ""carbon cubes"" that go into the ground, never to come up, over the course of a lifetime. They'd handle all the digging, burying, box-making and the like. Maybe even abandoned mines can be used for ""final storage""?

Anyway, I think it's a good idea, but I might be missing something. Tell me what you think. Realistic or is the carbon released by a country divided by all of it's people so much it's an impossible problem?","2016-03-19 21:30:00","1","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/4b4vex/whats_the_problem_with_sequestering_co2/","True","Ree81","1747873276.5474286","CO2 is good","manual"

Kevin is a surface scientist with a Ph.D. in chemistry from Johns Hopkins and an expert beer homebrewer. Craig is a science writer and editor for Chemical & Engineering News with a background in inorganic chemistry who brews kombucha and hard cider. After seeing some fake helium beer videos online, Kevin and Craig got into a discussion about whether it would be possible to do it for real. Their calculations suggested it was feasible, so they gave it a shot. You can read about the results, and get the recipe, at http://cenm.ag/heliumbeer We’ll be back at 12pm ET to answer your questions!

Edit - We are here to answer your questions! KW & CB

Edit - We are wrapping up. Thanks for all the good questions.  We might be back on later to answer more. -KW & CB","2016-03-15 12:15:19","267","50","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4ai61u/american_chemical_society_ama_were_kevin/","True","AmerChemSocietyAMA","1747873311.7364028","CO2 is good","manual"
