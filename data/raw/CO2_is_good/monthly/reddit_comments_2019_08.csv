In 2017, in the US, carbon dioxide (CO₂) comprised about [82%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases) of greenhouse gas emissions. Other greenhouse gas emissions affecting global warming include methane (CH₄), comprising about [10%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases) of total US greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, and nitrous oxide (N₂O), comprising about [6%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases) of total US greenhouse gas emissions in 2017.  
       
CO₂ emissions cause increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO₂ that will last [thousands](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials) of years, while CH₄ and N₂O have atmospheric lifetimes of [12](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane) years and [114](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#nitrous-oxide) years, respectively.  
        
Several man-made synthetic fluorinated greenhouse gases not occurring in nature comprised about [3%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#overview) of all US greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with atmospheric lifetimes up to [270](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#f-gases) years, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) with atmospheric lifetimes ranging from [2,600 to 50,000](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#f-gases) years, nitrogen trifluoride (NF₃) with an atmospheric lifetime of [740](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#f-gases) years, and sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆) with an atmospheric lifetime of [3,200](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#f-gases) years.

Al2O3 and other metal oxides are much more suitable and few times more effective per unit of mass of the matherial dispersed.

Plus all the already existing particulates which produce global dimming, estimated to be on the order of ~10% sunlight reduction average around the globe.

2nd, in effect, it's already happening on global scale, at very least unintentionally. The effect of global dimming is well known, undeniable, measurable, and exists for decades. Those politicians' debate is merely a cover op (whether they themselves are aware about it - is anyone's guess, but in the end does not matter). The only possible debate is whether to increase intensity of existing global dimming, or keep it as it is. It can't be removed even if desired. Reduced somewhat - yes, but not removed entirely. It will clear up only few years after collapse, once global industrial system stops.

While the latter part is disputable, there is no doubt SRM-like effect, at present, is already delaying the worst of climate change. It's just whether this postponing is more good or bad - is not possible to know at this point: having more time before collapse allows better preparation for it, thus better survival after it; while in the same time, postponing it increases its severity, as every year of ""business as usual"" adds extra emissions, pollution and damages, thus leading to worse survival after collapse happens.

Some form of solar radiation geoengineering is now required. We are currently coasting on significant cooling from the aerosol effect that all our lovely CO2 producing activities produce. If we suddenly cut that aerosol effect to zero, we get fried.

The sensible (which is why I'm fairly sure it won't happen) thing to do, is engineer low CO2 cost methods of continuing the global warming reduction we currently already have while we make big reductions in the CO2 producing activities that also produce the aerosol effect we are now relying on.

But. Like you. I think once the idea of producing a solar radiation reduction method sets in, the impulse will be to produce more aerosol effect than we currently have and simply mask the fact we are doing literally nothing to reduce our CO2 output.

One approach is a sane method of not frying ourselves while we take meaningful action. The other is a method of prolonging doing nothing until we utterly destroy ourselves a few years later instead.

EDIT: For the tinfoil hat version! Investigating solar radiation reduction measures could also just purely be for the rich / powerful elites. The world turns to shit. They retreat to bunkers. Billions die. Now you send up the high altitude balloons with dust for a few decades to reduce the heating effect when CO2 emission is roughly zero. Emerge from bunker. Win.

**Understanding the Permafrost–Hydrate System and Associated Methane Releases in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf** 

> Abstract
> 
> This paper summarizes current understanding of the processes that determine the dynamics of the subsea permafrost–hydrate system existing in the largest, shallowest shelf in the Arctic Ocean; the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). We review key environmental factors and mechanisms that determine formation, current dynamics, and thermal state of subsea permafrost, mechanisms of its destabilization, and rates of its thawing; a full section of this paper is devoted to this topic. Another important question regards the possible existence of permafrost-related hydrates at shallow ground depth and in the shallow shelf environment. We review the history of and earlier insights about the topic followed by an extensive review of experimental work to establish the physics of shallow Arctic hydrates. We also provide a principal (simplified) scheme explaining the normal and altered dynamics of the permafrost–hydrate system as glacial–interglacial climate epochs alternate. We also review specific features of methane releases determined by the current state of the subsea-permafrost system and possible future dynamics. This review presents methane results obtained in the ESAS during two periods: 1994–2000 and 2003–2017. A final section is devoted to discussing future work that is required to achieve an improved understanding of the subject.

**Dissecting Paleoclimate Change**

*Using a core sample from the Santa Barbara Basin, UCSB researchers decipher the history of paleoclimate change with surprising results*

> “One of the most astonishing things about our results is the abruptness of the warming in sea surface temperatures,” explained co-author Kennett, a professor emeritus in UCSB’s Department of Earth Science. “Of the 13 degree Fahrenheit total change, a shift of 7 to 9 degrees occurred almost immediately right at the beginning.”
> 
> Kennett noted that this remarkable record of paleoclimate changes also raises an important question: What process can possibly push the Earth’s climate so fast from a glacial to an interglacial state? The researchers may have discovered the answer based on the core’s geochemical record: The warming associated with the major climatic shift was accompanied by simultaneous releases of methane — a potent greenhouse gas.
> 
> “This particular episode of climate change is closely associated with instability that caused the release of methane from gas hydrates at the ocean floor,” Kennett said. “These frozen forms of methane melt when temperatures rise or pressure decreases. Changes in sea level affect the stability of gas hydrates and water temperature even more so.

No. AFAIK there are no studies that ""determine at what point does Human Civilization collapses and Humans go extinct""

There are way too many variables. It would be like guessing when the next stock market collapse will happen or when to sell bitcoin (except even more complicated, as you probably know because you just listed a big chunk of the variables and all of them are pretty much unknown).

You need to take that bunch of information and group it in to ""maybe this happens next"". Cloud loss for example isn't the next worry. A shit load too many clouds is the worry before we reach that point. By the time the clouds boil off we'll pretty much all be dead anyway. (YAY!)

Heh. Your post is a first. I sort of want to say ""No it's not as bad as that!"" but it is .. except the sequence of events is ill defined and will probably take longer than you seem to think. We will get there. It will be hell on the way. But it's one step at a time. And it probably only takes fairly minor climate problems to kick us towards collapse. You don't need everything to kick in and doom us to dust before society as we know it grinds to a halt.

Activists are largely mis-lead. Sorry. My view. Some may down vote for that. But virtually all the ""green activist"" solutions you see out there are designed around making already rich corporations richer at the expense of poor people. If you look at who actually profits from the accepted main stream narratives on what we should be doing, it's probably someone like the Koch Brothers (yes someone makes money from solar panels, EV's and windfarms, and it's not that ecologically sound at the moment to be making them .. it could be .. if the entire process chain was redesigned to be CO2 neutral! But it isn't). Bottom line. If you're voting for someone to make you poorer to fix this .. then it probably won't fix this. Well ok .. I assumed you didn't already have 10 billion in the bank. For the rest of us, struggling in the 3, 4 or 5 digit range of salaries it's true.

The only solutions we have to get ahead of the curve are profoundly anti-current-capitalist. I'm sure capitalists could make money off the new ideas if we did them, but for now we are stuck with the current bunch. We need a massive change to localised food production and consumption, easily repairable white goods, a huge shift in what we subsidise (air fuel, agriculture, fracking, tax evading corporate profits) to what we actually need to support.

And... it's not happening. So yes. You have a good summary of the problems (you sort of gloss over aerosols, and that's a huge hit on the climate if we ever did cut back our current patterns). And all of them .. in one way or another .. will probably happen (and probably more that we never knew existed).

Back around the beginning of worries about climate change, the concern was voiced .. ""If you wait until you can see the changes happening, it's already too late"". And that was shot down as a pathetic way to get tax out of the public for a non existent threat. Yet here we are. We can see the changes happening, and yes, it is already too late.","2019-08-14 03:31:31","4","mogsington","1747913302.8501208","CO2 is good","manual"

>There is limited evidence and low agreementon the readiness of this technology to contribute to rapid decarbonisation (Williamson et al. 2012). Only small-scale field experiments and theoretical modelling have been conducted (e.g., McLaren (2012)). The full range of CDR potential estimates is 15.2 ktCO2yr–1 (Bakker et al. 2001)for a spatially constrained field experiment to 4.4 GtCO2 yr–1 (Sarmiento and Orr 1991)following a modelling approach, but Fuss et al. (2018b)consider the potential to be extremely limited given the evidence and existing barriers. Due to scavenging of iron, the iron addition only leads to inefficient use of the nitrogen in exporting carbon (Aumont and Bopp 2006; Zahariev et al. 2008; Zeebe 2005). 

>Cost estimates range from 2 USD tCO2–1(for iron fertilization) (Boyd and Denman 2008)to 457 USD tCO2–1 (Harrison 2013). Jones (2014)proposed values greater than 20 USD tCO2-1for nitrogen fertilisation. Fertilisation is expected to impact food webs by stimulating its base organisms (Matear 2004), and extensive algal blooms may cause anoxia (Matear 2004; Russell et al. 2012; Sarmiento and Orr 1991)and deep water oxygen decline (Matear 2004), with negative impacts on biodiversity. Nutrient inputs can shift ecosystem production from an iron-limited system to a P, N-, or Si-limited system depending on the location (Bertram 2010; Matear 2004)and non-CO2 GHGs may increase (Bertram 2010; Sarmiento and Orr 1991; Matear 2004). The greatest theoretical potential for this practice is the Southern Ocean, posing challenges for monitoring and governance (Robinson et al. 2014). The London Protocol of the International Maritime Organization has asserted authority for regulation of ocean fertilisation (Strong et al. 2009), which is widely viewed as a‚ de facto moratorium‘ on commercial ocean fertilisation activities.

4.3.7.3 Soil Carbon Sequestrationand Biochar

>Evidence at global scale for potentials and especially costs is much lower. The literature spans cost ranges of –40–100 USDtCO2-1(negative costs relating to the multiple co-benefits of SCS, such as increased productivity and resilience of soils (P. Smith et al., 2014)and 2050 potentials are estimated between 1–11 GtCO2 yr-1, narrowed down to 2–5 GtCO2yr-1 considering that studies above 5 GtCO2 yr-1 often do not apply constraints, while estimates lower than 2 GtCO2yr-1 mostly focus on single practices (Fuss et al., 2018). SCS has negligible water and energy requirements (Smith, 2016), affects nutrients and food security favourably (high agreement, robust evidence)and can be applied without changing current land use thus making it socially more acceptable than CDR options with a high land footprint. However, soil sinks saturate after 10–100 years, depending on the SCS option, soil type and climate zone (Smith, 2016).

4.3.7.4 Enhanced Weathering (EW) and Ocean Alkalinisation

>In the case of land application of ground minerals, the estimated CDR potential range is 0.72–95 GtCO2yr–1(Hartmann and Kempe, 2008; Köhler et al., 2010; Hartmann et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2016; Strefler et al., 2018)(low evidence, low agreement). Marine application of ground minerals is limited by feasible rates of mineral extraction, grinding and delivery, with estimates of  1–6 GtCO2 yr-1(Köhler et al., 2013; Hauck et al., 2016; Renforth and Henderson, 2017)(low evidence, low agreement). Agreement is low due to a variety of assumptions and unknown parameter ranges in the applied modelling procedures that would need to be verified by field experiments (Fuss et al., 2018). As with other CDR options, scaling and maturity are challenges, with deployment at scale potentially requiring decades (NRC, 2015a), considerable costs in transport and disposal (Hangx and Spiers, 2009; Strefler et al., 2018)and mining (NRC, 2015a; Strefler et al., 2018)6.

>Site-specific cost estimates vary depending on the chosen technology for rock grinding –an energy-intensive process (Köhler et al., 2013;Hauck et al.,2016) –material transport and rock source (Renforth, 2012; Hartmann et al., 2013), ranging from 15–40 USD tCO2–1to 3,460 USD tCO2–1(Schuiling and Krijgsman, 2006; Köhler et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2016, limitedevidence, low agreement; Figure 4.2). The evidence base for costs of ocean alkalinisation and marine enhanced weathering is sparser than the land applications. Theocean alkalinisation potential is assessed to be 0.1–10 GtCO2yr–1with costs of 14–>500 USD tCO2–1 (Renforth and Henderson,2017).

>The main side effects of terrestrial EW are an increase in water pH (Taylor et al., 2016), the release of heavy metals like Ni and Cr, and plant nutrients like K, Ca, Mg, P and Si (Hartmann et al., 2013), and changes in hydrological soil properties. Respirable particle sizes, though resulting in higher potentials, can have impacts on health (Schuiling and Krijgsman, 2006; Taylor et al., 2016); utilisation of wave-assisted decomposition through deployment on coasts could avert the need for fine grinding (Hangx and Spiers, 2009; Schuiling and de Boer, 2010). Side effects of marine EW and ocean alkalinisation are the potential release of heavy metals like Ni and Cr (Montserrat et al., 2017). Increasing ocean alkalinity helps counter ocean acidification (Albright et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2016).Ocean alkalinisation could affect ocean biogeochemical functioning (González and Ilyina, 2016). A further caveat of relates to saturation state and the potential to trigger spontaneous carbonate precipitation.7While the geochemical potential to remove and store CO2is quite large, limited evidence on the preceding topics makes it difficult to assess the true capacity, net benefits and desirability of EW and ocean alkalinity addition in the context of CD

You only have to fix one thing. You have to transcend capitalism, and institute a society that is built on cooperation and without hierarchies, where we joinly own all the resources and where we make decisions based on scientific analysis with sustainability as the #1 criterion, and human wellbeing as a close #2. With all the automation and computerization we can do now, well, the term ""fully automated luxury communism"" is being bandied about, though I really prefer the term resource-based economy.

No more individualism, no more trade, no more currency, no more victimization of the ""weak"". From that, everything else sane would follow. 

Of course, people don't realize any of this or believe it can be done.  Instead they talk about money. Not reality, and not available resources.","2019-08-26 12:34:56","5","cr0ft","1747913362.4335053","CO2 is good","manual"

These fires will accelerate warming, which will kill the crops we need to feed ourselves. It will also accelerate sea level rise to meters per decade by 2060 or so.

The oceans will turn from carbon sinks into carbon sources as plankton are killed off by rapid abrupt acidification.
The natural sources of carbon will overtake human sources and trigger runaway mass extinction and runaway hothouse conditions, both which can't be stopped or reversed.

This disruption would have ramifications to world wide food production, especially agricultural and fishing. Probably resulting in hundreds of thousands if not millions to starve within a few years as the die off takes hold.

Yep, the proverbial ""golden billion"". Make no mistake though: almost all of them are not billionairs. Those are folks who can afford a large car or few, but not any yacht (merely a small boat at best); folks who make the economies going; folks who solve all kinds of problems that really need to be solved, but the poorest 40% just can't solve for the lack of resources and/or education; folks who you can still meet and call and talk with like any other regular person around.

Indeed, those people are exactly ones who could do largest reductions in comsumption without any much hurt to their life style, business and well-being. 

However, it is not them, themselves, who 1st and foremost would need to act, to make such reductions happen. It is instead very few - the elites, which is several hundred to few thousands people in the whole world, ones who actually make top-level decisions about internal policies of the global industrial system - who would need to change the rules of the system. Instead of pushing and motivating ""golden billion"" to everlasting growth of their personal assets - to push and motivate for sustainability and environmental responsibility, etc. Starting with mass media, school system, redesign of tax system aimed to protect the environment, changing whole banking system from ever-lasting debt spiral to flexible steady-state system, etc. 

But all that is too late to do. It'd take many decades to reshape whole system into those ways, and we don't have that much time. 

Brace for impact some time near the middle of this century - is what now needs to be done. Not carbon taxes or such. 

P.S. Imagine: you're in a car with broken brakes, your speed is over 100 miles an hour, your gearbox just broke being stuck on neutral gear, and you see a broken bridge right ahead, with nowhere to turn to avoid going through - and it's Grand Canyon right below the absent middle part of that bridge. Would you then try to fix the car's brakes or its gearbox so that you'd be able to stop the car from falling down? Or would you try to jump out of the car, despite all the speed, while there is still a chance to not fall into the Great Canyon and survive, even if badly bruised and with broken bone or two? That's where we are: the car is global civilization, and it's going to crash and become totally non-functional; the passengers of the car are each of us; and the Grand Canyon is the switch to HotHouse Earth, which will smash global civilization like nothing before, and which will happen in about 30 or so years, if not sooner. Smaller communities still have a chance to make it through, if badly beaten and suffering - this is bruises and broken bones above. Yet it takes time for people to switch from living within global system to living in at least somewhat self-sustainable regional communities, - and this is the jump from that car.","2019-08-02 16:10:08","2","Fins_FinsT","1747913419.200129","CO2 is good","manual"
