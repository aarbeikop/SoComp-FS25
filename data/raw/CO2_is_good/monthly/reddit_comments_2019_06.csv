On an individual level, make all the changes you can to reduce your consumption.

Wash your clothes less, wash them at 30, put a jumper on instead of the heating, get solar PV on your house, get some solar hot water panels and a tank, put a brick in your toilet tank, insulate your house with cavity/draft excluders, get a water butt for collecting rainwater, walk to the supermarket, cycle to work, buy an electric car or find a low polluting one in terms of g/Km Co2 or keep the car you have for as long as possible (if it's not too polluting), go vegetarian etc

Tumblr is not a reliable source of information. Neither is Reddit.

Climate change is not going to kill you. If you want to know how climate change will affect your home, check out last year's [National Climate Assessment](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov). Specifically you can check out the [chapter on the midwest](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/21/). The executive summary? By 2050 it'll be hotter, more rainy, and agricultural productivity will decrease. How much will it decrease? To a level comparable to the 1980s if there are no technological advances (a big assumption). So maybe you'll pay a bit more for food at at the supermarket. You might have to pay a bit more for flood insurance. There might be some more ozone awareness days.","2019-06-20 19:55:54","5","Freeze95","1747911044.4713202","CO2 is good","manual"

I've pondered the same mathematical relationship you have: If we reduce natural emissions or boost total absorption by just 5-6%, then we'll achieve net zero emissions.

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf).

Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)).

But [don't count on someone else to solve this problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility):

Voting in every election, even the minor ones, [will raise the profile and power of your values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U&t=2m53s). If you don't [vote](https://voteclimatepac.org/voters-guide/), you and your values can safely be ignored.

3. [**Recruit**](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/). Most of us are [either alarmed or concerned](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Six-Americas-Februrary-2019.png) about climate change, yet most aren't taking [the necessary steps](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) to solve the problem -- the [most common reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6DoiQM_-is) is that no one asked. If all of us who are ['very worried'](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/03/21/worries-priorities-and-potential-problem-solvers/) about climate change organized we would be >26x more powerful than the NRA. According to [Yale data](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-May-2017.pdf), many of your friends and family would welcome the opportunity to get involved if you just asked. So please [volunteer](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved) or [donate](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/donate) to turn out environmental voters, and invite your friends and family to [lobby Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CarbonTax).

"erazlwg","t3_c11bjp","c11bjp","collapse","skeptical","This anti-capitalist theme pops up on collapse every few weeks which is fine but it seems to be latestagecapitalism threads and users cross-pollinating the idea that capitalism and only capitalism and no other -ism at all for any time period in history is to blame for the shitfuck storm humanity finds itself in now, today 2019. It's pretty much technicallythetruth but capitalism itself is just a small piece of the fuck pie.

Under communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarianism, kingdoms it's always been the same. The truth is societal collapse happens and will happen under any human -ism currently or previously devised, even animals and insects, once a population of an area, region or the globe exceeds that areas carrying capacity. It's a law of nature.

For humans, regional societies have grown and collapsed because they grew in numbers, destroyed their local environment and broke the carrying capacity.  For thousands of years this happened over and over with some growing bigger than others but all ending with collapses. Forest cutting for building, farming, food and energy helped increase the population and their use of more resources which accelerated collapse. Thru that time societies would intersect and war over territory and resources but under previous energy regimes, the environment and their use of energy didn't really result in any global system-wide effects. 

It wasn't until around 1900 and the discovery of oil / fossil fuels instead of human, wood, steam or electrical power that things kicked into high gear with the US, Britain and most first world nations adopting oil as a cheap source of energy. 1900 is used as the baseline for climate models because of the start of the mass adoption of fossil fuels. It's clear as day on the chart. That's when it started. 

It was just that fossil fuel use for the last 120 years by everyone on the planet since, including third-world nations, juiced the ability for all of humanity to overshoot the unbeknownst-at-the-time imaginary parity graph that showed fossil fuel use and population against Earth climate change factors.

From the billion or so people in 1900 to today's 7.7 billion people all were and are consumers. We eat and breathe and build and have gotten ourselves to the point where the rate that all the people in all societies consume, plus medicine that extended lifespans, advances in technology and global transportation that allowed us to do it faster to where the global carrying capacity overshot with no more areas for us to expand.

But not only did all- isms accelerate the planet's carrying capacity breakdown we also toxified it and now wrecked the climate to the point where it won't be able to support this many people all using fossil fuels for much longer. I don't know when but even if that fossil fuel stopped today, humans have already spewed enough emissions into the atmosphere since 1900 that the resulting effects that we see and will continue to see are already locked in. Ice melts affecting the climate,  sea levels and now the carrying capacity of the entire Earth not just one region but with 8 times the number of people from when we started 120 years ago.

Malthus was right he was just operating at a much smaller scale. But he did imagine populations in the billions just using his time's metric of the carrying capacity per acre per person. Fossil fuels blew up that relationship up too.

Population isn't decreasing, its increasing exponentially and humans are just destructive no matter what ism they live under.  They are destroying and have destroyed the planet so this can't be stopped until the planet's ability to sustain human life is greatly diminished which could reduce population drastically until it is somehow able to level off, but with a much wilder and inhospitable climate.

A fully agrarian society couldn't function with this many people without a non-emissions energy regime but it'll still end the same.
The 'it's all capitalism's fault' never offers any new societal structures or solutions that won't run into the same problem at the scales of people and energy use we are talking about today or 100 years from now. Communism or socialism isn't the answer nor is capitalism. It's too late and we are debating over who made the mess. 

We humans fucked it all up.

"erb67df","t3_c11bjp","c11bjp","collapse","skeptical","It really depends what the nature of the collapse is.

If it's economic, is it one where the dollar is not the world's reserve currency anymore because trust is lost in the US?  That means hyperinflation as the printing presses rev up to pay interest.  Keep money in gold, silver, or whatever else you think will hold value.  Look up and study Weimar republic.  Note: an economic collapse does not mean hyperinflation, but coupled with an erosion of pax american might be likely.

Is it peak oil?  Get some bikes, electric bike with solar charger, or maybe a 100+mpg scooter or motorcycle (typically 150cc or less).

Is it environmental?  Farming?  Etc.

See, every collapse will have different needs.

Here's what will always help:  Get and stay in shape.  I recommend plant based diet against chronic illness, no meat or low meat (less than 2oz a day, smaller than a deck of cards), no cow dairy.  Calisthenic aka bodyweight fitness.  This requires no or minimal tools and focuses on functional fitness, not winning aesthetic contests.  Most people are surprised to learn how some bodybuilders can't do a pull up or some other move.

Keep some months supply of food.  Dry starches hold well.  (Rice, beans, etc).  In waterproof and vermin resistant containers.  Read up.

Have tools and some basic scouting skills like rope tying.  Learn in spare time.

Have some self defense stuff.  A weapon.  If it turns ugly for a while.  Martial arts for the most part is worthless on the street.  Fair fights or 1 on 1 isn't a given.  Better learn from a bouncer or a real course on street psychology.  Better yet, just be be basic at parkour.

Have a circle of family and or friends to rely on.  No man alone is an island.  Or a fortress.  No Rambo fantasies.

With your profession, go out and earn to support all this.  Don't spend the surplus on stupid shit like a brand new Tesla.  The collapse won't happen tomorrow.  But if you had a kid today, I'm willing to bet an economic or peak oil scenario is playing out by the time they'd hit 20.","2019-06-16 05:37:03","4","[deleted]","1747911417.5774117","CO2 is good","manual"

I think you're misidentifying the underlying cause. Yes it is tempting to blame capitalism, especially if that is shorthand for human behavior; but there's no such thing as sustainable exploitation - not with so many people on the planet. It is all unsustainable, green-tinged or not, whether it is under the umbrella of capitalism or any other political system. What would be your alternative to capitalism? Tofu and lentils? Or do you think state control would help? What do you think of China's hybrid approach?

We're now in the Anthropocene, and post our industrial revolution we're part of a self-sustaining growth engine. We're inside that, we're part of it.  Everything from the food we ate today to the posts we made on Reddit. And even apparently free tech - Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than Ecuador [(source](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2151823-bitcoin-mining-uses-more-energy-than-ecuador-but-theres-a-fix/)).  Targeting the worst aspects of capitalism is fine - that might make people's lives better to do that, if you can; but most of the proposed fixes - including green energy - are still fixes that would add more growth. Carbon dioxide isn't our only problem; it's just one of them.

If you *would* like to find out more about why we are where we are, and why the growth engine may now be out of our control, there is a good analysis [here](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-weve-created-a-civilisation-hell-bent-on-destroying-itself-im-terrified-writes-earth-scientist-113055).

There is one other aspect of blaming capitalism that concerns me. That is that a mass movement might send us hell for leather into a worse situation where the state makes all the decisions. We really don't have a good history with that, no matter how well-meaning it starts. 'The state' inevitably degenerates into a self-interested cabal of robber barons.

"esejjmu","t3_c71yg0","c71yg0","collapse","skeptical","Thank you /u/Dreadknoght for putting this together. I think you're missing some bulletpoints on the disruption of the nitrogen cycle, but a timeline for it is really difficult to make. [This study](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html) thinks changes to biogeochemical flows (particularly the amount of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus in our environment) are the ""planetary boundary"" at most risk (at least of the ones that have been quantified). [Here's](https://climateandcapitalism.com/2019/04/18/nitrogen-crisis-a-neglected-threat-earths-life-support-systems/#_edn3) [why] (https://climateandcapitalism.com/2019/04/29/nitrogen-glut-too-much-of-a-good-thing-is-deadly-for-the-biosphere/) that's the case. 

I had some qualms with a few of your bulletpoints, but by and large, this is a great start of a list. Users of this sub seem to have a habit of sometimes freaking out over inconsequential bullshit, perpetuating blatant fear mongering, and making very precise claims about topics (especially exact timelines for particular events) that experts would be, at best, VERY hesitant to make. You seem to have avoided most of the that, but you did make a few claims that I'd be a bit iffy about. Also, calling ~2030-2040 ""The Distant Future"" put me off for a second, because that starts 10.5 years from now. 

I admire your dedication to attempting to spread factual information. To quote you, ""Remember that the internet is not as simple as it used to be, and we as citizens must be prepared to fight misinformation with information."" I think that's critically important right now. 

A majority of people still show the denizens of this sub (and like-minded folks elsewhere) the same disregard and distain that everyone has rightly (for the most part) shown doomsdayers for millennia. Unfortunately for all of us, the circumstances that surround us are truly unique, and we are quickly running out of applicable historical references to aid us in decoding the shitstorm that is our future.

So yeah, shout out to Canadaland from my little corner of southwest Virginia. If you want some help in adding references to any part of your list, I'd be glad to do my part. It'd be next to impossible to get any kind of reputable sources for a lot of the Society bulletpoints, but finding good links for the Nature section seems more doable. It'd be awesome to get multiple good links for each point, especially links to peer-reviewed journals or [relatively unbiased news sources](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com). 

This legitimately has the possibility of being a damn good sticky for the sub, so I'd love to get something like this crowd-sourced to some degree. Perhaps people could say what (if anything) they are qualified to speak about authoritatively, and we could divy up bulletpoints accordingly. This may require a new thread, but I'll start anyway. 

I have three AAS degrees that qualify me for factory jobs bridging the white collar/blue collar gap, but I'm still quite wet behind the ears (less than half a year total working in any factory environment). I can still speak about the manufacturing sector, at least in broad strokes, to a greater degree of accuracy than the majority of people. I've done a fair bit of personal research on climate change (and all its many sub-issues), aquifer depletion, resource overuse, and more recently, nitrogen cycle disruption. However, I'm by no means an expert on any of those.","2019-06-30 13:24:22","5","froggyfox","1747911609.9759676","CO2 is good","manual"

If you're high enough in elevation, you will be spared the worst of the heat and humidity, as it decreases with altitude. That only leaves erosion from too much rainfall. Other than that, all positives: rich soil, close to year round growing season, large freshwater sources, low population density, far from nuclear targets or power plants, proximity to national forests and large amounts of game, and a population that's a little more 'collapse ready' than most of the US. Another great place is the Missouri Ozarks, and it has a lot of the same advantages. 

You won't have to worry about wildfires, winter, or drought, ever. 

Buy 5-10 acres high in the mountains, plant a food forest and a garden, and raise Nigerian dwarf goats for milk, cheese, and yogurt, ducks and chickens for eggs and meat, and possibly sheep for wool.

Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets the regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)).

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf), and [many nations have already started](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/). We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580). And the IPCC made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

[The U.S. could induce other nations to enact mitigation policies by enacting one of our own](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support; in fact, a majority in [every congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&type=value&geo=cd) and [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) supports a carbon tax, which [does help our chances of passing meaningful legislation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651).

Politicians [use this information](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x) to prioritize agendas.
