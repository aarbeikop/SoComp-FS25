"5dbqdy","climatechange","action-oriented","I just got punched in the gut.","I'm no youngster and have been exposed to ""environmental consciousness"" since at least high school. I've been sailing along blithely thinking I've been doing a good job by recycling, buying used fuel efficient vehicles and maintaining them well, growing some of my own vegetables, and reducing my meat intake. 

But it's warmer outside today than I think I remember it being. I should need a heavy jacket, but long sleeves and a light jacket are just fine. I just shoo'd a mosquito out of my car. We were supposed to have enough frosts by now that they all should be dead. Then I think back to flying over the country (I work in aviation) and note that lawns are staying greener longer. Trees haven't lost all their leaves yet. The red tide I saw blooming in lakes and on the ocean. The election that has brought with it the threat of climate change deniers and rollback of environmental policy. 

So I started doing some research. Looking at ocean temperatures. Atmospheric temperatures. Esoteric discussions of timelines and issues facing locations around the globe. 

Holy shit. This is gonna be bad. 

The wind got completely taken out of me. 

30-40 years to effect change and put it in overdrive?

100 years and mass migration, war and starvation are in progress?

150-200 years and civilization as we know it will decline to nonexistence?


Am I wrong or is this really what I'm reading?  Is this the timeline humanity is looking at? I wouldn't have had kids had I known this. My grandchildren likely won't survive to old age.  This is horrible. I spent the day writing to the president, president elect, and all my reps. It's put me in a doomsday prepper train of thought. I can't believe people aren't screaming for change. Help me to understand how this unfolds. 

Edit:  nobody has said no. There have been some hopeful observations, but I guess this is the course we're set on. I cannot express how grieved I am, for my family, yours and the Earth.

"5echzq","climatechange","action-oriented","Where to start becoming educated in Global Climate change?","Hello, so i have want to start becoming very educated on the science of global climate change and how it is affecting our earth. I have seen ton of articles on here, but i was wondering where you guys would say that i start? Any articles that are particularly good? Thank you.

"5fdt0m","climate","scientific","Need your help writing an article about Climate Change!","So im writing an article about climate change for my student newspaper. My school is very engaged in protecting the enviroment which is what my article will focus on.


Now i want to ask the question if the sacrifices are even worth it because most of the co2 pollution is because of industrial reasons so these ""small"" things have almost no impact. No of course i dont want to end the article on that note, what are some good convicing arguments that its still worth it?


And one more question: are there any credible sources for deaths caused by climate change in a recent year?


Thank you in advance if anyone is able to help out!

"5fri0i","collapse","skeptical","You guys are too optimistic.","I read the posts here, and I just have to shake my head. People saying we have decades left before total collapse. WAKE UP! The collapse is here. The collapse is NOW! Climate change has reached a threshold where we can't do a damn thing about it, save geoengineering on a massive scale. We could have massive food shortages as soon as next summer. Believe me. I have been urging folks to stockpile food, water, and weapons. And I continue to do so. It's a matter of life and death. Why do people talk about rising sea levels, which may occur by 2050 or 2100 (or some other far off date). The real threat is to our food and water supplies, which are susceptible to even a single season of globally-warmed heat and drought. The Dust Bowl occurred with CO2 levels just a bit above 300 ppm. Guess what would happen if the same weather patterns hit today with CO2 in excess of 400 ppm? I think we find out next year.","2016-11-30 19:13:57","51","141","0.74","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5fri0i/you_guys_are_too_optimistic/","True","-_David_-","1747880771.954402","CO2 is good","manual"
