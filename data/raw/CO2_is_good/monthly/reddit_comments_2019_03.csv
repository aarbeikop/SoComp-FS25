In rough order of scale:
1.) Electrical generation
- solar & wind are cheaper than coal & gas in most of the world now.  
- Decarbonizing our grid is the fastest and cheapest way to make fast progress 
- The residents of my city petitioned our power company to decarbonize, and they’ve listened. By 2030, we will have zero CO2 emissions 

2.) Transportation 
- Passenger vehicle miles need to come down, and switch to electric vehicles.
- In the UK, this one might be less applicable for you. ( Compared to the US where I am)
- Phasing out gasoline engines will make a good dent

3.) Electrification of Heating/Cooling
- Natural gas furnaces can be replaced with heat pump technology, as well as hot water heaters.
- Petition your local government to change building codes to require electric HVAC systems

4.) Agriculture & Food
- Get your food from local farmers who practice restorative farming techniques. (Organic farming)
- Done right, farming sequesters carbon in the soil.  Done poorly, farming emits CO2","2019-03-26 03:03:22","7","lepatterso","1747908541.1519046","CO2 is good","manual"

Albedo effect of tundra vegetation accelerates global warming

Each would have as its primary mission to demonstrate self-contained sustainability, with no, or almost no material inputs from outside civilization. Secondary missions would include training long-term visitors in sustainable agriculture and manufacturing (with minimal outside inputs), and serving as very-long term repositories for human knowledge. These wouldn't be small communities: I would expect each incorporate multiple current biomes and be around 1000-2000 km^(2) in area.

The funding would go primarily to land acquisition, an initial allotment of temporary housing, seed and tools, and to perimeter security regulating both human and material traffic. Participants would be primarily fertile volunteers who are willing to spend their remaining lives within these communites, with long-term trainees and perhaps carefully screened tourists permitted to walk in and out from the perimeter with only what they can carry.

Think of these as an initially sponsored, secular hybrid between an Amish community/hippie commune, a residental occupational college, a national archive, Asimov's Foundation, the Long Now Foundation, and Biosphere 2. Anyone should be permitted to leave for morality's sake, though any that leave for extended periods will face the same screening as initial participants/trainees/tourists. External bodies would manage financial endowments to expand communities, maintain security/screening, obtain genetically diverse crops/livestocks, and provide support for those children who chose to participate in the outside world, instead.

The mission of these communities would evolve over time, and they would need to plan on effects of extreme climate change in their storage/cultivation of heat/drought tolerant crops that may have limited current utility. They may also be expected in the very long term to develop more integral security/defense, as even their relatively stable environs deteriorate.

It was part of hydrocarbons, formed using the energy of the sun and then later compacted into tighter forms by geology. So a lot of energy and time went into it. We found the different types eventually, the easiest ones on the surface first. We used these hydrocarbons for fuel, extracting the energy, and used some of that energy to get more hydrocarbon. So on and so on. The side product was CO2 and other things.

To reverse this, we can't do it for free, like the extraction and usage was. We need to use energy, lots of it, for capture, for changing to some form other than gas, to bury it again. That has to be energy that won't make more CO2 also.

Compare the difference, and you see why entropy is brought up. Removing CO2 from the air is very much an uphill battle with nothing to show for besides less of it in the air. No energy, no profits, nothing. Even if we could harness enough energy to do all that, it would be at the cost of not having that energy for anything else.","2019-03-16 13:57:52","2","Rhaedas","1747909116.041583","CO2 is good","manual"

The proposal was to spread 15 billion tonnes of finely powdered basalt across farmland all over the world. Short term this had been shown to have benefits for the soil too although long term and with repeated spreading it posed some problems.

The paper suggested that at most this 15gt of powdered rock could sequester 5gt of carbon but probably less... which is a drop in the ocean in terms of how much is in the atmosphere and only a fraction of what we emit each year. I couldn't get a definitive timeline for how long it would take to absorb that amount only that it would need to be reapplied maybe every couple years to remain effective. The rate it works at depends on rainfall and carbon dioxide concentration in the area as it functions by reacting with the CO2 in the water.

One of the biggest issues with this of course is that the mining, powdering, transportation and spreading of it would be done using fossil fuels so it will have a big footprint just to begin with. This would be an ongoing thing too with more needing to be added intermittently and it is questionable how many times you could even do it before the soil chemistry is negatively effected. The paper was also talking about spreading it on pretty much all farmland worldwide which would require a massive effort. Considering the ecological damage likely to be caused in the mining process it doesn't seem like a great solution when it would make so little difference.

I read up on this because I saw many people hailing it as being some miracle that would immediately fix the problem and indeed I found numerous articles sharing that sentiment but as with most things further reading showed that it wasn't anywhere near as effective as people were thinking.","2019-03-16 08:27:01","1","Fredex8","1747909116.0470924","CO2 is good","manual"

There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. Humans are a plague, and abrupt climate change is the cure.

nah, we *will* be going.  Functionally speaking.  

The only debate is whether we'll go completely extinct, or whether the planet can support a few thousand of us in a primitive lifestyle.","2019-03-06 21:12:54","13","egadsby","1747909153.5113378","CO2 is good","manual"
"ehxrjff","t3_ay080w","ay080w","collapse","skeptical","What you posted there sounds about right. Funny how you mentioned that you would compare our civilization to organisms in their environment. When I was standing in a university microbiology lab for the first time a long time ago and we were recording a bacterial growth curve in a so-called batch culture, that is, a culture with limited nutrients, I realized that this ultimately looks quite similar to us humans on Earth (including the inability to avoid collapse), only on a flask vs. planetary scale. The question was and still is, how long until the limitations of our environment force us into our ""stationary phase"" and ""death phase""? At some time later I also came across a couple of bacterial culture setups in which they didn't die off because of the eventual lack of nutrients but because of toxic compounds their metabolism produced during their initial growth phase. That's also something that our civilization is somewhat familiar with by now.","2019-03-06 19:23:28","7","Geobac","1747909153.519957","CO2 is good","manual"

I was wondering if you would be interested in sharing this as a mini op-Ed/type post on [my site](http://libraryofcollapse.org) ? It's only recently launched and gets nearly zero traffic, but I'm trying to get some good collapse analysis on there. 

No worries if not - thank you for sharing regardless!","2019-03-06 20:33:54","5","thereluctantpoet","1747909153.5204754","CO2 is good","manual"
