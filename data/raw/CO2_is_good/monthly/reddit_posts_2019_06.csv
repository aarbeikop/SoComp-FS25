I've searched youtube pretty deep into the results and their debate was virtually all I could find, which is pretty alarming.

It would be nice to get a list going, assuming that's not the only video.

I'd also like to see any non-video debates people may know of.

I'm a big believer in debate's ability to guide us to the truth, and I really hope the corrupt DNC will make ACC more of an issue.

Climate Change is easily the greatest existential threat to civilization today. If you are not aware of its potential effects, a[ recent report by the Breakthrough Centre For Climate Restoration](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_b2c0c79dc4344b279bcf2365336ff23b.pdf) says that Civilization could end by 2050 if Climate Change continues at the rate we see today.

Arguments can be made for Nuclear War, Mass Migration, and other issues being the greatest threat to humanity.

But steps have been taken to address those threats- especially in the United States.

Unfortunately, Climate Change has hardly been addressed in the United States in the way it needs to be. The fact that[ 97% of actively publishing climate scientists](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) believe climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities- and that we have[ a President who outright denies climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940)\- proves that point.

What can we do? Let’s start out with the basics. 

The United States is a world leader, no matter your view on the current government administration. [As the 12th richest country in the world](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/richest-countries-in-the-world), the United States has the power to help create the needed change to prevent absolutely catastrophic global warming- but we will need a complete shift away from the current political, social, and economic structure we see in the United States (and the world) today. The solutions to Climate Change are already ready to be deployed. As young activist Greta Thunberg said, “People tell me I should study to become a climate scientist so I can solve the climate crisis. But the Climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is wake up and change.” Greta is right. Studies have been done to show that [100% renewable energy in the United States is achievable by 2050](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/here-s-roundmap-get-us-run-100-renewable-energy-2050/). And frankly, we have no excuses, because other studies have shown [100% renewable energy around the WORLD ](https://physicsworld.com/a/a-global-100-renewable-energy-system/)is achievable by 2050. There are three sectors that I mentioned earlier that will be imperative in making lofty goals like these possible; economic, social, and political. Let’s go over them. 

Politically, lobbying is a huge problem, as[ Fossil Fuel giants pour money into the greedy mouths of corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/25/oil-and-gas-giants-spend-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-infographic/#6442f5017c4f) politicians to halt climate change action that would greatly affect Fossil Fuel Giant's profits. First off, [lobbying](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/) from Corporations must be cut off from the government- and I mean the entirety of the Government, not just Presidential Campaigns.  Then, a complete switch of executive power in the United States to a President who supports a form of a Green New Deal to push the United States to a position where leading the world to a future of[ less than 2 degrees Celsius of warming](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-heat-related-deaths) is needed. Unless those measures are taken, a future that locks in to 3 degrees Celsius of Warming is likely- and[ that would be absolutely catastrophic.](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/?utm_source=web&utm_campaign=Redirect) But why us, some of you may be asking? Why do we have to step up when we see movements starting all around the world to oppose man made Climate Change? It's a simple answer.[ The United States is a world leader in CO2 emissions](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions). And after ten years of decline in emissions levels from 2005 to 2015, United States emissions aren’t decreasing at the rate they need to be, and have either plateaued or increased. Without a full reaction to Climate Change in the United States, full efforts around the world would be much less effective as we continue to cloud our judgement with the haze of fossil fuels.

But again- where does the 2020 Presidential Election play into this? 

Look.[ Clearly, we can't rely on Congress](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++). Many of its members- and key ones, too- take payments from Big Oil and Fossil Fuel corporations that impede progress. Members of the Senate and House have been corrupted by these corporations,[ through lobbying](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuel-interests-have-outspent-environmental-advocates-101-on-climate-lobbying) and direct payments. It’s a shocking, sad reality- but money has taken priority over human lives and the future of our world as a whole. Also, AOC’s [‘Green New Deal’ didn’t even get through the Senate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-fails-advance-green-new-deal-democrats-protest-mcconnell-sham-n987506) (not that that was a surprise). What’s needed is the House and Senate to be in control of the Democratic Party- then clearly, a Green New Deal could be passed. As Robinson Meyer, a writer for The Atlantic who covers climate change stated, “Every additional Senate seat that Democrats take in 2020 could help them pass a Green New Deal. Sudden demographic change—such as a surge in enthusiasm among young voters—could push electoral math in Democrats’ direction.” [But that is far from a guarantee, even if it is possible](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/green-new-deal-why-democrats-will-struggle/581245/). With that in mind, a Democratic President who is willing to take Executive action to push Green policies into place would be needed. Why not just wait until 2024, though, if it isn’t likely pass a Green New Deal in 2020? If you’ve been paying attention, you know we are living on time we don’t have. Every day that passes digs us deeper into the climate grave we are burying ourselves in. [Any possible executive action](https://thebulletin.org/2019/03/what-could-happen-if-a-democratic-president-declared-a-national-climate-emergency/) against climate change if the Senate and House aren’t controlled by Democrats will have to be taken. It wouldn’t be pretty, but it’d be a necessary step. 

Socially, communities must understand that creating change to stop climate change doesn't come from driving an electric car, or going to the local Farmer's Market. Creating Change includes stepping up to buyback power grids from private companies that inhibit renewable energies- as we’ve seen [in Germany](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/political-breakthroughs-brighten-outlook-for-germanys-grid-expansion#gs.is6vp3) (although there have been problems- see the link). When the electricity grids are put in government control, all of a sudden the interests are put into what the people want, and not what the private shareholders want- which is obviously more money. This is happening here in the States, not just Germany- [take Boulder, Colorado as an example](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/04/18/boulder-makes-68-5m-offer-to-acquire-xcel-energy-assets-as-it-works-toward-municipal-utility/). However, only one state in the United States has a completely publicly owned electricity sector. That state is Nebraska, where there are lower electricity rates than the national average. A greater push is needed to promote renewable energy in cities across the United States. People must decide whether climate action is important enough to them to vote in government officials who will create change- and if they do, they must go out and vote in that way! Those same people must also take part in stepping out of the fundamental free market property known as mass consumerism. I’ll let this quote from The New Republic explain it for you. 

“C40 Cities, a network of 94 of the world’s biggest cities, released a report on Wednesday estimating how much consumption habits drive the climate crisis. The results were staggering: In those nearly 100 cities, where a combined 700 million live, the consumption of goods and services “including food, clothing, aviation, electronics, construction and vehicles” is responsible for 10 percent of global greenhouse gases. That’s nearly double the emissions from every building in the entire world.”

If you connect the dots, it’s easy to tell that a much more conservative, get-what-you-need lifestyle is a necessary part to implement into every day society if we are to slow climate change at the rate it needs to be slowed. So how does that relate to the 2020 election? Well, it’s pretty easy to tell that simply asking people to travel less and consume less won’t work. People need to elect in officials that will put policies in place to create the needed lifestyle. There must be a total infrastructure redevelopment in order to make this work. That includes greatly pushing public transit, reducing urban sprawl tenfold, increasing clean water supplies, and reducing food deserts so low income and lower class people can access the resources they need. Those lower income people also need to have less financial stress too- which we could see come into play through nationwide healthcare and a flexible living wage that would be different state to state depending on what an accurate living wage is in a given state. You see, the 2020 election is going to light a path that all of our futures will take. That’s especially true for the lower class that I’ve mentioned. They are the ones who will be most greatly affected by Climate Change, and ironically, they are the least responsible for Climate Change. Those with high amounts of wealth are the ones who most directly cause Climate Change, through travel and mass consumption, among other things. That’s why political austerity and tax slashes for the rich literally need to be reversed- taxes need to be placed on the rich in order to improve life for those who are least responsible for climate change but will be most greatly affected by Climate Change. Once that is achieved, the stages of a Green New Deal can be put in place to curb climate emissions and create new jobs. That includes massive investments in building public transit, creating city wide composting systems, building more affordable housing, redesigning city layouts to be more compact, and many more options that will [create millions of jobs](https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal). This all connects back to 2020 because literally none of this can happen without communities coming out to vote for the candidates that will make this all possible. The social revolution that I have outlined can and will happen- but it all banks on you and 2020. 

Every person reading this and every person in the United States has a voice. But who’s voice is louder; the people’s, or the green bills in their pockets? Economically, money has the loudest voice in our current state. What is that current state, you may ask? Unfettered Capitalism. Around the world, free trade agreements, corporations, and political corruption influence our green future and our present society the most. Corporations and Fossil Fuel Companies are allowed to spread over the world and pump emissions into the atmosphere at catastrophic rates- a [2017 Guardian ](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change)article said that 71% of global emissions are caused by roughly 100 companies. Of those companies, fossil fuels are the worst- “ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988.” If those companies are allowed to run rampant all over the world, drilling oil and making billions while guaranteeing the deaths of millions, than we have slammed the door on our already closing coffin. But if a step away from unfettered capitalism is made towards a more government regulated business sector that removes the ability of corporations to lobby and places strict environmental restrictions on those corporations, then there is hope. Free trade agreements also greatly inhibit efforts to stop climate change, and they must be restructured in order to save the planet. Naomi Klein, author of ‘This Changes Everything (:) Capitalism vs The Climate’ stated, “As the free trade system was put in place and producing offshore became the rule, emissions did more than move- they multiplied.” Trade agreements are severely lacking in environmental regulations- and the Behemoth of trade agreements, the WTO, is the worst of them all. [Their website even says the following](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm): “The WTO has no specific agreement dealing with the environment.”  They even go further to say, “...the removal of trade restrictions and distortions can yield benefits both for the multilateral trading system and the environment.” These are just two among many environmental hypocrisies you can find on their site that I linked in above. [Green protectionism](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/envir_req_e.htm) is a particularly fun one that inhibits local renewable energy efforts. Clearly, that’s barely brushing the surface but I do believe you see the point I’m trying to make; Unfettered Capitalism must be stopped in order to save our planet. The 2020 Election is the time for us to step up and vote in a leader who will see these problems and make the needed moves. 

All of these changes are possible! That much is clear. 

Yet here we are,[ pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/06/01/one-year-since-trumps-withdrawal-from-the-paris-climate-agreement/) (Which isn't enough, by the way) and[ pushing billions of dollars into the fossil fuel industry through government subsidies.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them)

It's clear that the Trump administration isn't going to do anything to stop Climate Change- as I've helped illustrate, they encourage it. So when 2020 rolls around, GO VOTE. Vote for our future, and vote for our planet. I’ll never force on you who to vote for- but I’ll tell you one thing. The candidate I want to win? He’s not favored to win because of ‘electability’. :).

"bwxwtk","environment","emotional","Funding green living though Carbon Tax","Wrote this essay for my political science class and was curious about others opinions.

&#x200B;

Since the late 1800’s, the past 5 years have been the hottest years on record and the temperature keeps rising. As humans, our effects on this drastic change is apparent, from a natural perspective, the largest source of Co2 comes from volcanoes generating 200 million tons of carbon annually, just our automotive and industrial activities alone cause 23 billion world wide in the same time frame (“Are Volcanoes or Humans Harder on the Atmosphere?”). Solving Climate Change is going to be a long and difficult process, our modern and comfortable ways of life here in American would be altered completely but if left undealt with, its estimated that Damages could be as high as 20% of worldwide GDP, if action is taken it would only cost 1-4% of the GDP by 2030. Being that buildings are responsible for 38% of all Co2 emissions (“How Buildings Impact the Environment”), changing the way American housing is handled would prove to be very beneficial to reducing this number. For example, by increasing the use of individual green energy systems such as household solar power and decreasing the use of exposed concrete in cities are both simple ways a positive impact can be made. 

Before we look at the ways we can help decrease the impact of buildings, it's important to figure out where funding for projects of this magnitude could come from. Creating restrictions such as a carbon tax could prove to be beneficial. The Carbon Tax method can be seen in use worldwide (26 programs total) and is proving to have good effects on the economy and environment alike. The B.C Government's Carbon Tax Brochure describes the idea behind the method, “Tax the pollution we do not want, and return the money for what we do want - money in people’s pockets, jobs and investment.” This taxation does a good job of making the transition to a healthier environment without putting the US more in dept to ourselves. When looking at incorporating a National Carbon tax into a nation so diverse in an industrialized sense, places that are heavily industrialized or have a large population such as Texas or California, would be receiving more funding for the more improvement needed. In the end this method would create a lower and more equal carbon footprint among the states. British Columbia is only one of the many places that have taken advantage of this system. With these 26 carbon tax programs already in use, it can give us a good idea of what to expect from the system and shows that if done correctly it can be beneficial for both the economy and the planet. 

Now that the funding is out of the way, we can start looking at the changes that can be made to better our environment. As we progress further into the future, an abundance of discoveries and improvements are being made with the ability to have a substantial impact on how we go about making this change. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric and more, are quickly becoming part of our energy mix but still only account for 11% of America's energy use (“The United States Uses a Mix of Energy Sources”). Increasing this number is an important step to a healthier future. When looking at housing in rural or suburban areas, the usage of rooftop solar is pretty logical being that plenty of open roof space is available, using the money collected from the carbon tax, we would be able to fund the installation of these household solar panels. With this method all excess electricity generated could also be pumped into the grid, further lowering the reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately highly Urbanized areas currently account for 20% of our overall carbon footprint (Miller), because of the lack of roof space available and the dense living population, solar as seen in more rural areas wouldn’t prove as effective. In places such as these, the new technology of solar windows could be a major contributor in the future of city energy. According to research at Michigan State, the United States could get 40% of its electricity from solar windows, the University estimates that 5 to 7 billion square meters of usable window space is available, when paired with 15% efficient panels, that 40% could be achieved. In practice, covering those billions of window space is substantial task to be achieved, nevertheless this surely goes to show how big of a role this technology can play in future green cities even if used on a smaller scale.  

Moving away from solar, other building techniques have been proving beneficial to lowering the impact of urban areas. The Urban Heat Island effect has also had a substantial impact on the energy usage in cities. Compared to surrounding rural areas, its estimated that a city with 1 million people or more can be up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer during the day and 22 degrees warmer at night(Donegan), much of this effect can be credited towards open concrete soaking up the sun's energy, windows reflecting and the heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. With all the tall skyscrapers, the natural, cooling wind flow is also obstructed. In Nature, soil does a good job soaking up the rain, which on warm days, would be evaporated, in turn, cooling the air, with cities most of this rainwater just runs down into the sewer system. 

The introduction of window solar panels would help decrease the reflection of the sun's energy but besides that solution, looking to minimize the amount of heat soaking into the concrete would be beneficial. In Manhattan, there is up to 40 square miles of rooftop space, to help fight the urban heat, the NYC CoolRoofs program has reduced the temperature of 6 million square feet by painting the roofs white. On hot days the dark asphalt can reach up to 190 degrees, if the program continues making progress its estimated this would cool New York’s air temperature by 2 degrees (McKendry). Although just 2 degrees may seem like a small number, when put in conjunction with other methods, a noticeable difference can be made. Rooftop gardens have also been seen to make a difference, because of the water and heat soaking soil, the water evaporates creating cooler air and creating food in the process. Simple and cheap solutions like the ones listed above can have massive impacts when implemented on a citywide scale, in response to creating a cooler urban environment, the need for energy eating devices such as air conditioning would also decrease.

Creating an entirely green city would prove to be a task that may take many years but so far, we seem to be heading that direction. Using some of the methods above, digital designs of future sustainable housing developments are starting to form. Although sparse, neighborhoods are already starting to form providing to be a proof of concept, so far many are quite successful. Currently here on the Pacific Coast, a model eco-friendly neighborhood is being constructed with the goal of having little to no negative environmental impacts (no carbon, trash, and have sustainable water management). The success of developments such as this show that this change can be done, it's just the matter of time and commitment.

The change to a more Eco-friendly way of living is going to be a very long process, in order to make this change, we will at some point, need to give up many of our basic comforts we use so often. Totally changing how products are being manufactured would call for a major shift in the values corporations and civilians must follow. By starting this change from a place such as buildings and city design, we are able to make an impact without having to alter the basis of our economy relying on our industrialized ways. Other technologies are constantly improving and becoming more viable with helping this change. With more and more communities, programs, and research going into solving this issue, we are surely going to be seeing change for the better within the future.","2019-06-05 03:17:42","2","1","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bwxwtk/funding_green_living_though_carbon_tax/","True","Tobias_Muldoon","1747911284.6754024","CO2 is good","manual"
"c11bjp","collapse","skeptical","A collapse is coming, capitalism has destroyed the world. Can we take advantage of the fact we are cognizant of this?","Shit is going to get bad in the next 20 or 30 years, if not much sooner. Capitalism is without a doubt responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. It encourages the unsustainable exploitation of every natural resource on this planet, maximizing short  term profits over every other possible motivation. The fact you are reading this right now means you likely have come to a similar conclusion. 

We cannot change these facts. The end is already written for human society, at least as we know it. The vast majority of people in the world have their heads in the sand, willfully ignorant that society will all come crashing down much sooner than they expect. I think the only option we, as individuals cognizant of this, really have left at this point is to the exploit the existing system to our own benefit. 

At the top of my list is securing a place to live in an area of the world which will be minimally affected by climate change. I'm not sure where yet, I hope I still have a little time to research this topic thoroughly and make my plans. Another thing I have been considering is how various facets of the world economy will change as a result of climate change. What can I invest in now to allow me the means to  secure shelter, food, water and safety when shit really hits the fan? 

As climate change becomes more pronounced, growing enough food to feed the ever growing human population will become tougher and tougher. Global supply chains will break down, millions of people who depend on food being imported from halfway around the world will starve. Humans will turn to science to fill the gaps, crops genetically engineered to grow in inhospitable environments, meat grown in petri dishes in a lab, technology will not be our savior but it  may stave off the inevitable for a few years. Companies which offer this hope will make billions in the years before the collapse.  Can I leverage this fact to gain security for myself before everything falls apart? I studied biomedical engineering in school and got a job designing genetic sequencers for a living in the hope that I could. Other than these vague hunches, I have no fucking idea what is going to happen, what to do about it or why I wrote this post.","2019-06-15 19:47:50","615","417","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c11bjp/a_collapse_is_coming_capitalism_has_destroyed_the/","True","wataf","1747911415.109668","CO2 is good","manual"
"c134t7","collapse","skeptical","Some first-hand insight into what happens when a society collapses - from Bosnia","From /u/CoyoteBanned (who is no longer active)

He posted this last year and it's fasinating:

One year in Hell... I am from Bosnia. You know, between 1992 and 1995, it was hell. For one year, I lived and survived in a city with 6,000 people without water, electricity, gasoline, medical help, civil defense, distribution service, any kind of traditional service or centralized rule.

Our city was blockaded by the army; and for one year, life in the city turned into total crap. We had no army, no police. We only had armed groups; those armed protected their homes and families.

When it all started, some of us were better prepared. But most of the neighbors' families had enough food only for a few days. Some had pistols; a few had AK-47s or shotguns.

After a month or two, gangs started operating, destroying everything. Hospitals, for example, turned into slaughterhouses. There was no more police. About 80 percent of the hospital staff were gone. I got lucky. My family at the time was fairly large (15 people in a large house, six pistols, three AKs), and we survived (most of us, at least).

The Americans dropped MREs every 10 days to help blockaded cities. This was never enough. Some -- very few -- had gardens. It took three months for the first rumors to spread of men dying from hunger and cold. We removed all the doors, the window frames from abandoned houses, ripped up the floors and burned the furniture for heat. Many died from diseases, especially from the water (two from my own family). We drank mostly rainwater, ate pigeons and even rats.

Money soon became worthless. We returned to an exchange. For a tin can of tushonka (think Soviet spam), you could have a woman. (It is hard to speak of it, but it is true.) Most of the women who sold themselves were desperate mothers.

Arms, ammunition, candles, lighters, antibiotics, gasoline, batteries and food. We fought for these things like animals. In these situations, it all changes. Men become monsters. It was disgusting.

Strength was in numbers. A man living alone getting killed and robbed would be just a matter of time, even if he was armed.

Today, me and my family are well-prepared, I am well-armed. I have experience.

It does not matter what will happen: an earthquake, a war, a tsunami, aliens, terrorists, economic collapse, uprising. The important part is that something will happen.

Here's my experience: You can't make it on your own. Don't stay apart from your family; prepare together, choose reliable friends.

How to move safely in a city
The city was divided into communities along streets. Our street (15 to 20 homes) had patrols (five armed men every week) to watch for gangs and for our enemies.

All the exchanges occurred in the street. About 5 kilometers away was an entire street for trading, all well-organized; but going there was too dangerous because of the snipers. You could also get robbed by bandits. I only went there twice, when I needed something really rare (list of medicine, mainly antibiotics, of the French original of the texts).

Nobody used automobiles in the city: The streets were blocked by wreckage and by abandoned cars. Gasoline was very expensive. If one needed to go somewhere, that was done at night. Never travel alone or in groups that were too big -- always two to three men. All armed, travel swift, in the shadows, cross streets through ruins, not along open streets.

There were many gangs 10 to 15 men strong, some as large as 50 men. But there were also many normal men, like you and me, fathers and grandfathers, who killed and robbed. There were no ""good"" and ""bad"" men. Most were in the middle and ready for the worst. 2. What about wood? Your home city is surrounded by woods; why did you burn doors and furniture?

There were not that many woods around the city. It was very beautiful -- restaurants, cinemas, schools, even an airport. Every tree in the city and in the city park was cut down for fuel in the first two months.

Without electricity for cooking and heat, we burned anything that burned. Furniture, doors, flooring: That wood burns swiftly. We had no suburbs or suburban farms. The enemy was in the suburbs. We were surrounded. Even in the city you never knew who was the enemy at any given point.

What knowledge was useful to you in that period?
To imagine the situation a bit better, you should know it was practically a return to the Stone Age.

For example, I had a container of cooking gas. But I did not use it for heat. That would be too expensive! I attached a nozzle to it I made myself and used to fill lighters. Lighters were precious.

If a man brought an empty lighter, I would fill it; and he would give me a tin of food or a candle.

I was a paramedic. In these conditions, my knowledge was my wealth. Be curious and skilled. In these conditions, the ability to fix things is more valuable than gold.

Items and supplies will inevitably run out, but your skills will keep you fed.

I wish to say this: Learn to fix things, shoes or people.

My neighbor, for example, knew how to make kerosene for lamps. He never went hungry.

If you had three months to prepare now, what would you do?
Three months? Run away from the country? (joking)

Today, I know everything can collapse really fast. I have a stockpile of food, hygiene items, batteries -- enough to last me for six months.

I live in a very secure flat and own a home with a shelter in a village 5 kilometers away. Another six-month supply there, too. That's a small village; most people there are well-prepared. The war had taught them.

I have four weapons and 2,000 rounds for each.

I have a garden and have learned gardening. Also, I have a good instinct. You know, when everyone around you keeps telling you it'll all be fine, but I know it will all collapse.

I have strength to do what I need to protect my family. Because when it all collapses, you must be ready to do ""bad"" things to keep your children alive and protect your family.

Surviving on your own is practically impossible. (That's what I think.) Even you're armed and ready, if you're alone, you'll die. I have seen that happen many times.

Families and groups, well-prepared, with skills and knowledge in various fields: That's much better.

What should you stockpile?
That depends. If you plan to live by theft, all you need is weapons and ammo. Lots of ammo.

If not, more food, hygiene items, batteries, accumulators, little trading items (knives, lighters, flints, soap). Also, alcohol of a type that keeps well. The cheapest whiskey is a good trading item.

Many people died from insufficient hygiene. You'll need simple items in great amounts. For example, garbage bags. Lots of them. And toilet papers. Non-reusable dishes and cups: You'll need lots of them. I know that because we didn't have any at all.

As for me, a supply of hygiene items is perhaps more important than food. You can shoot a pigeon. You can find a plant to eat. You can't find or shoot any disinfectant.

Disinfectant, detergents, bleach, soap, gloves, masks.

First aid skills, washing wounds and burns. Perhaps you will find a doctor and will not be able to pay him.

Learn to use antibiotics. It's good to have a stockpile of them.

You should choose the simplest weapons. I carry a Glock .45. I like it, but it's a rare gun here. So I have two TT pistols, too. (Everyone has them and ammo is common.)

I don't like Kalashnikov's, but again, same story. Everyone has them; so do I.

You must own small, unnoticeable items. For example, a generator is good, but 1,000 BIC lighters are better. A generator will attract attention if there's any trouble, but 1,000 lighters are compact, cheap and can always be traded.

We usually collected rainwater into four large barrels and then boiled it. There was a small river, but the water in it became very dirty very fast.

It's also important to have containers for water: barrels and buckets.","2019-06-15 22:46:37","353","87","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c134t7/some_firsthand_insight_into_what_happens_when_a/","True","Trevelayan","1747911530.2287824","CO2 is good","manual"
"c71yg0","collapse","skeptical","A Brief Timeline for Collapse","I have noticed that, besides the general feeling of inevitability, no one ever really lists all of the causes which may lead to a collapse. Therefore, I wanted to create a realistic timeline for the predictable things that we could expect to happen in the future. These are just my vague opinions though, so feel free to disagree with them as much as you'd like if I am mistaken about anything.

As a disclaimer anyways, I am not omniscient, so I can't predict every natural distaster, international conflict, unforeseen catastrophes, or any other incredibly important catalysts that could accelerate the decline in our standards of living. I will try to briefly touch on these issues, but it is enough to just be aware that these things could happen at any time, unpredictably.

And with that out of the way, lets start shall we?

**~2020-2030: The Near Future**

***Nature***

- The Actic Ice extent reaches historic lows semi-regularly (possible BOE)
- The Northwest Passage becomes a common navigable summer/fall route for shipping
- Permafrost melt will [continue to visibly accelerate](https://globalnews.ca/news/5406057/canadian-permafrost-thawing/), as the unusual arctic warming caused by the rising CO2 levels continues to get worse.
- Due to this unusual arctic warming, the polar vortex will start to break down and become unstable, which will cause an increase in the severity and regularity of extreme weather fluctuations.
- The Brunt Ice shelf breaks off of Antarctica, as does other unstable ice-shelfs which have not yet started to noticeably crack.
- Coral reefs worldwide undergo yet more annual rounds of bleaching, destroying many habitats and potentially wiping them all out.
- Red tide comes again to the east coast of the USA, which will more than likely become a new common phenomenon that occurs. The red tide zone may also expand into neighborhing regions, and humans may for now step in to prevent the worst outcomes 
- Dead zones in the sea becomes ever the more larger, as anoxic water, phosphorus/nitrogen rich waters, plastic, and other contaminations kills the ocean wildlife.
- As well, the pecentage of plastic content in our oceans becomes ever the more larger and noticeable. The rate of pollution does not slow down.
- Hurricanes will begin to be seen as consistently common events to be expected, rather than a once in a while catastrophe 
- Regions which never experienced hurricanes before will now get to experience the fun of deadly weather (such as the Mozambique hurricanes this year)
- Droughts, floods, and other erratic and unusual weather systems will be noticeably commonplace in regions which had never before experienced it.
-Wildfires becomes an annual occurrence  in regions which are wooded, and are now prone to droughts. Over time, these forests will be destroyed by the fires, and for now, humans will step in to contain the worst outcomes of uncontrolled fires.
- The destruction of forests for pasture/farm land will also continue. Many of these forests also effect the environment that they're in (such as the Amazon Forest's cloud seeding), and this deforestation will have unforeseen consequences for the environments around them.
- Water shortages will start to become uncommon but noticed, and humanitarian efforts will for now eventually step in for the worst affected regions. Conflicts may arise, but they will not be the tragic life or death struggles that we will see in the future
- The Ozone layer will [continue to deplete if the current uses of it doesn't stop.](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44738952)
- More species will die due to human activities and climate change, but humans will only be subconsciously aware of the lack of wildlife that are around them, and the underlying ecosystems will not unravel just yet.

***Society***

- A probable recession, or depression, catalyzed by international politics.
- Wealth inequality only worsens, and unless new governments are voted in to fix these issues, societal stresses to the lower classes will increase
- The increasing use of cyber warfare through social media campaigns, intelligence gathering, and the building of resentment amongst citizens to destabilize competing nations.
- Possible conflicts may have already arisen for natural resources such as water, arable land, or oil by the end of this period.
- A growing number of climate refugees, combined with unforeseen war time refugees and economic refugees, may cause politics to shift even more to the right as citizens becoming increasingly frustrated with open borders (as seen during the Syrian refugee crisis).
- Unless something radical occurs, protests will continue to become increasingly common place (think of the Yellow Vest protests, the Arab spring, Charlottesville, the 1% movement, extinction rebellion, the list goes on). Regardless of the specific messages behind the protests, it'll all be fueled by a percieved disenfranchisment, wealth inequality, and a growing sense of resentment amongst nations (internal and external).
- Terrorism that never really stops, but becomes increasingly normalized as governments try to combat a fight which they can't win (i.e. without becoming authoritarian).
- In response to terrorism, western nations will lose more freedoms in the name of *safety*, but this loss of freedom will not yet be used maliciously.
- Other nations, such as India, China, Russia, etc, will not tolerate extremism, and will swiftly deal with terrorism using the force of action (forshadowing how they will deal with the upcoming climate crisis).
- Global awareness for an ""impending catastrophe"" (without the knowledge of exactly what) will be mainstream. Denialism will of course still exist, but they will start to be seen as 'fringe' due to demographic changes (i.e. older people dying).
- A growing polarization of politics, as tensions around the world increase from a mixture of all of the above points.

**~2030-2040: The Distant Future**

- Many of the things  that happened during the Near future will also occur in the Distant Future (increasingly erratic temperature fluctuations, the death of coral reefs, an increasing red tide, anoxic waters, an increasing amount of plastic pollution, floods and droughts, desertification, water shortages, terrorism, etc). The effects of these are very likely to be worse than before.

***Nature***

- The arctic ice, if it has not melted yet, would have almost certainly experienced at least one Blue Ocean Event by now. If it has not, at the very least the older ice within the Arctic would have almost all melted, with only the thinner, newer ice remains.
- Due to the warming arctic, the Northwest Passage is now navigable for most, if not all, of the year. It now becomes cheaper to ship stuff from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Yay!
- However, because of this loss of ice, Arctic ecosystems start to fail, and many species are irreparably lost. Boo!
- The northern hemisphere experiences *even warmer* temperatures as the polar vortex becomes destabilized. Europeans/North Americans will recieve the worst of the warming (as seen by the record breaking temperatures recently).
- Desertification continues in the already existing deserts (Sahara, Gobi, Atacama, the American deserts etc). New areas which, due to climate change, experience frequent droughts may also start the process of desertification.
- Depending on how bad the arctic melts are, the polar vortex may form a di/tripole system, meaning arctic warming intensifies.
- Permafrost, if it melts in large enough quantities *may* engage a process called a [Clathrate gun.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_gun_hypothesis?wprov=sfla1) I'm not sure when this will occur, however, but the possibility is always there.
- Antarctica will [continue to melt increasingly faster.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/world/climate-change-antarctica-ice-melt-twin-studies/index.html) I would assume that it will take a while to melt completely, but it will nevertheless consistantly raise the levels of the oceans as time goes on.
- And with that, the sea level will indeed continue to rise, possibly flooding the lowest laying islands. Certain island nations may now cease to exist due to a lack of land above water.
- Depending on how bad the ice melt is, the North Atlantic Current may start to slow, or break down. The consequences for this is still yet unknown, but many theorize that Europe may cool down. 
*However, I disagree with this, since that scenario implies that the Arctic ice is actively cooling down the European continent. Once the arctic ice melts, I believe there will be no temperature gradient between the arctic and the equator during the summer (due to the tilt of the earth, the 24-hour arctic sunshine, and with no ice to reflect all that energy). This implies the desertification of southern Europe, tropical conditions in northern Europe (without healthy ecosytems due to a failure for plants to rapidly adapt), stronger hurrcanes which reaches further north than what is possible today, and unusually severe continental weather in Eastern Europe/Russia (i.e. record breaking highs during the summers, and moderately cool/warm temperatures throughout the winter). For North America it'll be similar, with the same severe continental weather that will similarly hit Canada and the US. All of these combined will cause..*
- Crop failures. They will start to become commonplace, but for now at least, humans have the upper hand. GMO's, chemicals, and other technologies will save us from a complete famine (excluding the third world, which depending on each countries circumestances, may experience unrest/famine). 
- Certain agricultural products which, if available at all, may become scarce in the first world.
- Farmer subsidies begin to grow even more, and people wonder what will happen to the crops that they need to eat in the future.
- Depending on how many flammable forests are still left, wildfires may still be occurring annually.
- Ocean dead zones become even larger, and clearly noticeable to humans
- Ocean fish stocks plummet where over fishing occurs, and certain seafoods become expensive/scarce/extinct.
- The increasingly warming oceans will produce even stronger hurricanes, and in unusual places. A few record breaking hurricanes will have probably occured by the end of this period, but hypercanes and other super storms will not quite yet be a rare occurance. 
- Nations (specifically island nations) which experience devastating hurricanes annually may have already collapsed.
- The Holocene extinction becomes even more noticeable as a good number of insects, birds, large predators, and other forms of life which can't adapt as fast as their changing environment, die.

***Society***

- At least one (probably two) worldwide depressions/recessions should have occurred by the end of 2040, and so the unforeseen consequences that goes along with it would have become widespread and noticable.
- Many theorize that peak oil may have occurred by this time. This would mean an increase in oil price, the scarcity of oil, a breakdown of international supply chains, and conflicts within regions with abundant oil. *However, I believe this will occur in the Far Future.*
- Conflicts over natural resources, if nothing has yet occurred, will probably be seen as inevitable in their near future.
- Incoming climate refugees becomes an international crisis again, as socio-economic supply chains becomes strained under an increasingly hostile world. Nations which can't themselves become self-sustainable (or at least, not starve) will inevitably fail. Migration from these states that are not blessed with stability (such as we now see right now in Syria and Venuzuela, but globally) will spill over into neighboring regions.
- Nations which are authoritarian will swiftly deal with refugees using carrots (assimilation) and sticks (genocide).
- Other, more morally responsible nations, will continue to struggle with incoming climate refugees. This, combined with wealth inequality, and the increasing scarcity of resources, will inevitably spark conflicts amongst the lower classes.
- The freedoms in western nations which were taken away in the name of *safety* will continue, as well as newer restrictions (possible media censorship, a further decrease in internet privacy, water/food rationing, etc). This will be normalized under the generations which will be born, and raised, under these new 'normal' conditions.
- At the very least the world will become a bi-polar world by now, between the United States and China. Depending on how well India can deal with the upcoming climate crisis, and depending on how integrated the European Union can become (and how they deal with refugees), and depending on how successful Brazil is , there is a strong likelyhood of a multi-polar world developing in the near future.
- A new cold war between major nuclear powers (regardless if the world is multi-polar, or bi-polar).
- Neo-colonialism will have become rampant. As unrest and famine occurs within the third world, and indeed increasingly so in the first world, many desperate peoples will have no choice but to work for foreigner companies in order to secure a steady pay, a full belly, and security for their families. 
- Depending on the severity of climate change up to this point, the resiliancy of each state, and individual circumstances, certain nation states may have already collapsed, with others filling the power vacuums left behind.
- A ever more growing polarization of politics, as tensions around the world incresse even more from a mixture of all of the above points.

**~2040-2060+: The Far Future**

*I will preface this period by admitting that predictions mean very little here. It's almost certain that any sort of unforeseen consequence would have occured by now (I'm sure you guys can use your imagination). I'll just list the obvious things that I can think of.*

- Many of the things that have occurred in the Near to Distant future will probably continue to increasingly worsen in the Far future.

***Nature***

- The arctic ice will have been long gone by this point, and the arctic will have been ice free all year round (at the very least, semi-regularly) This will be catastrophic to the stable temperatures that we depend on to grow crops, and without the temperature gradient between the equator and the arctic to power the vortex, this will be the canary in the coal mine for some sort of collapse.
- The implications for an ice free arctic can not be overstated, since without any ice, the current climate maps that we use can just go out the window. No longer will Northern Europe, Canada, Russia, and Alaska be anywhere near as cold as it is right now, because, why would it?
- Permafrost collapse (and the clathrate gun hypothesis) becomes [fully realized.](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/frozenground/methane.html) 

>There is a huge amount of carbon stored in permafrost. Right now, the Earth's atmosphere contains about 850 gigatons of carbon. (A gigaton is one billion tons—about the weight of one hundred thousand school buses). We estimate that there are about 1,400 gigatons of carbon frozen in permafrost. So the carbon frozen in permafrost is greater than the amount of carbon that is already in the atmosphere today.

- Desertification spreads northward due to droughts combined with record breaking temperatures that happen annually across the equator. Those who are living in the affected regions will not have a good time.
- As ocean temperatures rise, it is unlikely that fish will continue to thrive. [There is a chance that certain species may be able to survive in a warming ocean,](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/05/30/squid-are-winning-adaptation-race-in-warming-ocean/) but overfishing/plastic/pollution will make their success short lived.
- Extreme weather events become ***even more*** extreme (wet bulb temperatures, fatal heatwaves reaching 55c+, deep freezes, etc), as these systems scour the earth with which human need to grow food on, and to live on 
- Many places that are temperate nowadays will be radically changed. The individual weather systems are too complicated to predict, however, the effects are the same (changes which happen to fast for nature to adapt to).
- Ecosystems collapse worldwide due to a variety of reasons like the death of insects from pesticides, the inability for creatures to adapt to hostile weather, a lack of food, habitat loss, ocean acidification, etc, etc.
- Crop Failures have become normal due to extreme weather fluctuations, and farming subsidies are no longer working due to the decrease in GDP growth (for nations which are not blessed with stability, and even so, for some nations which are 'stable')
- Product shortages become commonplace in the global market place, as a mixture of climate change, crop shortages, and state conflicts over finite resources occurs.
- Famine becomes an international crisis. As the global poplulation increases, and as erratic weather patterns decrease the amount of usable arable land, there can only be one logical conclusion (and this time, GMO foods won't be the silver bullet). Unless human can grow the food they need, a global famine is inevitable.


***Society***

*This world will be a much different place than the one we inhabit today, and without going into the specifics, I will try to talk about the general trends which may occur*.

- Peak oil will eventually occur once the known reserves run out. However due to new extraction methods, newly found sources, and the possibility for carbon capture, Peak Oil will probably occure late into the century (60/70s)
- Neo-colonialism is now the only way to procure resources, since due to the nature of a multi-polar world (assuming Mutually Assured Destruction stays true, and if everyone hasn't blown themselves up), conflicts will inevitably arise in a finite environment. Likely this will be in the form of proxy wars by the Great Powers, and civil/conventional wars for minor powers. Conflicts will be over water, arable land, precious metals, oil, and other resources.
- By now, while noting the decline in global stability through the rejection of the western-backed United Nations by rivalling major powers such as China and friends, it is possible that a nuclear exchange could have occured by now (most likely from Pakistan/India over water). I am unsure what this will exactly entail for the international community, but nonetheless, hundreds of thousands (if not millions) would die.
- Wealth inequality, if never addressed, is the worst it will ever be for those who are disenfranchised. If the current trends do not change, then indentured servitude is the only option for those who face starvation (due to the finite amount of food available).
- The number of incoming climate refugees will regularly reach all time highs, as certain areas which were a home to millions of peoples become inhospitable. This would be from a mixture of reasons like sea water flooding coastal cities, regular floods and droughts, extreme temperatures, crop failures, diseases, etc.
- The number of climate refugees on the borders of certain nations will become unsustainable. I am uncertain about the exact scenarios that may occur, but the effects are the same; people will flee regions which a great number are dying in, and the nations which can't handle the number of incoming refugees will choose between genocide and collapse (because, in a world of scarcity, will nations want extra mouths to feed?)


So there is my list of easily predictable things that could occur. Even though I still feel that it is too simple in this complicated world that we inhabit, I do believe that I have touched upon, at least broadly, most of the topics which are commonly discussed today. I could go on and on, adding, edited, and fact checking myself into oblivion, but i wanted to take a breather or see if anyone in this community had additional causes which they believe may occur. I may post an updated version once I feel happy with the results, but this isn't a thesis paper, and I've done quite a bit so far.","2019-06-29 17:18:48","147","50","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c71yg0/a_brief_timeline_for_collapse/","True","Dreadknoght","1747911609.378983","CO2 is good","manual"
