This one is listed twice:

http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-study-shows-global-sea-ice-diminishing-despite-antarctic-gains

It's good to organize large lists by sub-topic, which appear to be partially done here.  

I'd also recommend:

The latest IPCC reports:

http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/

http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/

The Discovery of Global Warming:

https://www.aip.org/history/climate/index.htm

Seems many pseudoskeptics have a warped view of the history of climate science.

"csxnpmk","t3_3coya2","3coya2","climate","scientific","You have my compliments for your efforts, but I fear you're only preaching to the choir. Much research shows that science, facts, data, have no bearing on ape beliefs and no group is more stubborn than deniers. You would think that just the incredible and growing amount of disasters - forest fires, heat waves, drought, water shortages, floods, melting glaciers and disappearing snow packs, etc, etc, would have some influence, but no, Deniers have only doubled down, which is a common response when worldviews are challenged. There is no upper limit to denial. As for information try Guy McPherson's climate change summery update. Not to push his near term extinction meme, but because it  contains a massive collection of peer reviewed papers and science articles and is constantly being added to. Best of luck to you.

"ct0dngj","t3_3cyxoq","3cyxoq","environment","emotional","It's not that simple of a question really.  It all depends what values you assign to the various impact categories of ""environmental harm""  such as water use, CO2 emissions, energy use, eutrophication potential, and others. You may improve in one category (say CO2 emissions) but actually be doing *more harm* in other categories, which is known as a trade-off. You can only improve standard plastics in all categories so far given its production and raw materials.

If you aren't familiar with [Life Cycle Assessment,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment) it's worth reading up on. There are also plenty of assessments (be careful though who performed or commissioned the study though) out there that compare the impacts of many different materials (e.g. plastic vs paper vs styrofoam vs biodegradable cups).
