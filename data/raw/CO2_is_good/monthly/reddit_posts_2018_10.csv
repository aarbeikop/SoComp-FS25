It was the year 2015 when atmospheric levels reached the 400pt per million milestone, the last time CO2 levels was this high was around 15-20 million years ago when temperatures were around 3-6 degreesC hotter than today.

This means that we have already reached the point of no return, even if we stopped all of our carbon emissions today global warming could still kill us UNLESS we find a way to extract the CO2 from the air, a project that will require a mandatory global effort of epic proportions.

It has only been three years since 2015 and let me tell you, the top three hottest years since 2015 are the following...

1. 2016 (to be replaced by 2018 without doubt)
2. 2015
3. 2017

And this year of 2018 we had one of the hottest summers on record, we saw wildfires above the arctic circle! Don't know about you but that's a major red flag of what is to come.

How will this rapid change play out? How will this affect us? Well, assuming that the amount of CO2 we already have will increase our temperatures to at least 3C the results would be catastrophic at best. I am going to list some temperature milestones down below, each with their own shared video which explains how each milestone will effect us.

The Carbon Race

I  am sick and tired from watching the news, reading reddit that climate  change is getting worse and worse, eventually killing us all if nothing  is done to fight it. In short, nothing ever is done, yes some people cut  back on meat and dairies, collect plastic, clean up an occasional beach  but everything is simply too small scale to be of enough use.

The  common question 'what can I do?', when answered and put into action  will lead at  best to some personal changes which in the grand scheme of  things mean very little. There are organizations like Greenpeace that  combine people's efforts  but as it is now, they lack the results that I  and I guess other people have in mind. Much potential efforts are in my  opinion are wasted. You give money and then what?  People want to  contribute more than just some money that we are unsure about where it  will go to or how it will be used.

As it  is now, people feel powerless, so much so that they forget that they can  contribute if only they are organized it bit more and a bit better.

So  I have another idea, maybe it might work, maybe it might not, but   every little extra effort into the right direction might just be enough  to save us.

The idea goes as follows;  
There  are many kinds of races & competitions, just put on the television,  cake competitions, barbecue competitions, solar races(Australia),  programming competitions, and whatnot. Its a powerful format that can do  more than just entertain us..  
What about competitions that produce  actual solutions combating CO2?, from at first low level to later on  higher and still higher levels... As such I propose a multi tiered  competition to combat the rice of CO2,  
The first tier is about people  designing new and novel CO2 capturing devices. The winning contestants  will get a 'green man' award, and his/her efforts will be immortalized  on the internet scoreboards.

The second  tier will be to those who are able to make these designs work, the ones  who are able to put them into practice, The device that traps the most  CO2 wins, and gets a 'Green Lady'.

The  third tier is marketing, for people who can turn these machines, devices  or processes into a viable product that people want to buy. Make the  possession of such a device desirable, a sign that you care and want to  help, in fact *that* you help.... These people will get an 'green emperor'.

Finally  the fourth tier is for those who are able to are able to scale up these  machineries, the bigger the better, those people or communities who are  capture the most CO2 will receive a 'Green Empress'.

This  approach is much more productive than worrying about the fact that you  cannot do do anything because when working this way anybody can add some  effort to the cause.  
There are many different levels that you can help,  for instance;

\- Getting the necessary materials  Researching a concept or idea, is it viable?

\- Collecting data and info about CO2 capture for a wiki, so there is no need to scour the internet for any relevant data.

\- Starting a Patreon    r/[https://www.patreon.com/](https://www.patreon.com/)

\- etc, etc, this is just scratching the surface.

Once  a concept has proven to work, it can be streamlined for mass  production, and perhaps designed into something beautiful, something  desirable. Consider a CO2 capturing machine given the shape and flair of  a race car or an apple product.

Finally  some ideas will be too big in scope to be manufactured this way, from  private machines it will go to something communal. Something 	that a  community can be proud of, and that is of more interest and use than  say; 'The largest ball of twine this side of the 	Mississippi', or the  biggest 'paper mache cow of Maine'.

The 	'Green Race' combines many ideas and concept at once.

It  gives pretty much all people a change to contribute something, either  by intellectual, monetary, practical or by logistic means.

It  makes actions against global warming more mainstream . And will lead 	 the way to I hope larger and larger projects. You begin with a 	machine  the size of a coffee machine, and up with something so large it  literally cannot be seen as whole since the greatest part of it 	 disappears behind the horizon.   It 	shows people that we can do things  ourselves, and that we do not need to rely on our inept governments.   That we can personalty contribute to fight climate change without all  those who can but refuse to lift a finger.

The  	problem is, I cant's do it alone, let begin to spread the idea, the  message and build ourselves a few forums, reddit might be a good 	 start... ;)

Q & A

Q; what do want to see initially to be produced?, has it to be a machine or what?

A;  not necessarily a machine, for instance if you happen to know about a  chemical compound that attracts and stores CO2, and that is harmless to  the skin, then you can perhaps permeate it into a T-shirt. Everybody who  wears such a shirt becomes a walking CO2 capturing device, now you only  need to print a nice slogan on it with perhaps some kind of carbon  capture logo..  
This is very low level, but helps and spreads  awareness.  There have to be other things that can be devises, low and  high level. Another idea is simply by powering a CO2 capturing machine  by sunlight and solar cells. The captured CO2 can maybe be converted  into bricks for building dams

Q; Yes, but will it help?

A;  It will do more than just sitting at reddit reading about the coming  climate disasters, what's more, it makes it possible to make some money  without feeling bad about it, actually helping the environment...

Q, Why only CO2 ?

A; any gas that traps heat should be removed so no not only CO2.

Q; Okay, I want to help, where to go to, what to do?

A; Lets organize, for the initial phase, use the power of internet. Put up a website, or forum here at reddit. See who can do *this* or *that* the best and organize ourselves accordingly...

Q; I cannot do this, I am not like Elon Musk, Einstein or Steve Jobs.

A; But working like this you *can* contribute to fight climate change, there is no need to be as high profile as these guys to be of use.

Q; How big does this carbon-race  to become to have any effect?

A;  As big as it needs to be (humongous), the main motivators are twofold;  to save our climate and to grow new ideas and business making money by  saving the climate instead of destroying it.

Q; There are already many ways to capture carbon, why develop new ones?

A;  yes, but many are only been tested in a lab, or currently too expensive  or not effective enough. It's not necessary to develop entirely new  ones, but rather to work with and improve the technologies that are  available right now. Make them dirt cheap  so we can deploy them in  large numbers. That goal should be attainable for the common  non-specialist and hobbyist. Much like the people  who to work and  develop cheap 3D printers.  When these processes become commonly used,  they will be so much more effective.

Q; Can I re-post this text, and change/improve  it where I deem it to be necessary?

A; yes, please do, in fact I insist, let's make this go viral.

My excuses for any typos, mistakes and other errors in my text, but we we have to start  somewhere, and we must start *now*...","2018-10-10 09:02:45","3","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/9mxswz/combating_climate_change/","True","CarbonForests","1747904494.4821546","CO2 is good","manual"

Sigh.  


Maybe we don't deserve this planet. I acknowledge how the Elites and TPTB want to control us and if that means destroying everything around them, then so be it?

"9pyai8","collapse","skeptical","My thoughts on Brexit (long)","Today there was a huge march through London demanding a second referendum on Brexit. Like many people from the UK I have spent a fair amount of time thinking about the issue. However coming from a collapse perspective I find it difficult to discuss the issue with those around me, or indeed on many of the main UK subreddits. Far too many people take an ""us or them"" attitude and as it becomes clear to both sides that I don't unequivocably support their position I find myself surrounded by enemies. But I want to write my thoughts down, so I'm posting them here, since I am likely to get a more rational response than elsewhere. I'm sorry if it's not completely on topic for the sub.

Firstly, one aspect of my position has been unaltered almost from the start. I wish the whole thing would just go away. Much of the argument is based on manufactured controversy and distracts from far more important matters, such as debating climate change and the true nature of Britains economy and her place in the world.

Back in the '90s a young journalist working for the Telegraph worked out that he could peddle a large amount of made up nonsense about the EU and the newspapers readers would all lap it up, making his column extremely popular. That journalist would, a while later, enter politics and then the government. His name was Boris Johnson. Before long, other right wing newspapers, such as the Express and Mail, followed suit, copying his style. Controversy riled up anger and indignation from their readers and more newspapers were sold, as they presented themselves as champions against Brussels bureaucrats.

So right from the start Brexit was based on lies. More lies were told during the campaign, such as the idea that if we left we would suddenly receive a huge financial windfall as we would no longer need to pay in to EU coffers. This lie was two-fold. It ignored the portion of EU funding that was already returned to us through EU investments, and also neglected the trade loss we could face, which could easily dwarf any dividend from ceasing EU contributions.

The campaign also saw more sinister interventions. We know that the leave campaign cheated and broke electoral law, hiding links between groups that were legally supposed to be independent. Advertisements were funnelled from mysterious sources to Northern Irish parties in order to bypass limits on mainland UK spending. Cambridge Analytica became involved with it's empire of facebook data, whilst Russian online trolls spread misinformation.

Since the main Brexit vote, our political leadership has shown itself to be incompetent in implementing the result. The Conservative government began by serving up hollow and meaningless slogans (""Brexit means Brexit"", ""Red White and Blue Brexit"") in an attempt to bypass any substantial debate. They have also been constantly riven by internal factions, each pushing for a different type of Brexit, and have been unable to present any sort of coherent or realistic position to our European negotiating partners. Meanwhile our main opposition, the Labour party, promises a ""have your cake and eat it"" Brexit where we would somehow both control immigration and be members of the single market, a combination that the EU has repeatedly told us is unaceeptable.

To me, the whole Brexit campaign is a symbol of collapse. A floundering nation lashing out at it's allies, looking for easy targets to blame for it's own failures. After Brexit, Britain will be both poorer, and far less influential internationally. Many of the tactics used by Brexit campaigners are reminiscent of those of Trump, and it's not by accident that figures such as Steve Bannon have visited our shores.

The above seems to be a pretty solid case against Brexit. It's perfectly understandable that many of the intelligent people I know in real life, as well as the majority on /r/UnitedKingdom are unequivocably against it. And yet, though I detest the Brexit campaign and the spinelessness of much of our current crop of politicians, I find myself still not entirely convinced. Leaving the EU will definitely be a short term disaster for the UK, but that still leaves the question ""what will remain bring? Might that also be a disaster over a slightly longer term""?

The EU was initially founded in the aftermath of the second world war in order to promote peace and trade between European countries. It was created to bind the countries of Europe, and in particular France and Germany, together so closely that a repeat of the two world wars would be unthinkable, and has succeeded admirably. The organisation was created in the image of the victors of the second world war, Britain and Germany, with principles such as democracy, capitalism, and human rights, right at it's core. However to me, these might represent it's eventual undoing.

Firstly I'll consider capitalism. We live in a world where global warming presents an existential threat to human civilization. This threat has been known about since at least the early 90s, and since that time several major international treaties have been signed to counter the threat, and yet still the amount of Carbon Dioxide present in our atmosphere inexorably rises. Governments make promises, do little, and then either claim credit for CO2 reductions caused by factors largely beyond their control (such as a decline in domestic industry) or backslide and decide that a new runway or coal mine is just what the economy needed after all.

Capitalism is a system that's extremely effective at maximising expansion and utilisation of natural resources. It is perhaps the best system known to man at encouraging economic growth and is responsible for the creation of much of modern civilization. However we are entering a new era with an extremely different challenge. Instead of wanting to maximise growth we want to limit it and focus on sustainability. Is capitalism still the best system for this new goal? How can it be when it's modus operandi is to route around any restrictions on trade, creating new paths for products to find a market. It naturally creates a ""balloon"" effect where if government dictat restricts resource usage in one area, then the market will spontaneously redirect them elsewhere. For example, if the EU restricts use of petrol in cars, then perhaps that same petrol will instead be diverted to fueling cars in India, or perhaps the oil used to make it will be diverted to an entirely different industry, such as agriculture or power generation. But what use is diversion when the only real solution to global warming is to leave large amounts of oil still in the ground. How can capitalism possibly do that? How can a system that so excellently encourages growth, show such self restraint. Who would ignore an extremely profitable resource sitting below their feet for some far off global benefit?

Furthermore capitalism has effectively ""gamed"" democracy, particularly in countries with a first past the post system such as the UK and the US. Political parties have learnt that all you need to do to win an election is to focus on a few marginal ""swing"" constituencies, which massively amplifies the effects of campaign spending whilst effectively disenfranchising the vast majority of the population that don't live in swing states / constituencies. This has led, over time, to the massive corruption of both major US political parties, and to the spinelessness of many UK politicians who take their views from focus groups not their underlying principles. News laws, are written by lobbying groups, whilst ordinary voters are ignored.

Lobbying also plays a key role in the EU, with an estimated 30,000 lobbyists pushing mostly corporate agendas in Brussels. In Europe, we might look at US politics and say ""isn't that corrupt. The EU isn't nearly so bad"". And yet, all I can think is ""give it time"". The US has existed for 240 years, whilst the EU has only existed for 70. Corruption is an insidious force that tends to grow over time. Power also tends to migrate from the periphery to the center. In the states we can see this with the growing power of federal government at the expense of the states, whilst in the EU, we can see moves to centralise functions such as foreign policy and defence. As power centralises, it becomes more and more attractive for lobbyists. Instead of lobbying dozens of national or state governments they can get all their lobbying done in one place. So if we ever end up in some sort of ""United States of Europe"" I'd expect its politics to be every bit as corrupt as those of Washington (or more so).

Which brings us to the nature of politics in the EU. It's a complicated system and most people only have a vague understanding. There are three main decision making bodies - the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission, each with different powers. Only one of these bodies is directly elected. It has a president, but in most cases hardly anyone voted to give him his position. For example, how many people voted for the current president ""Jean-Claude Juncker"" from Luxembourg? If I thought he was doing a good job, who do I vote for? Who are the candidates to replace him, and how do I vote for them? If I objected to EU policy in a particular area, such as, for example, agriculture, then how do I change it? Who do I vote for? Most people in the UK haven't a clue if or how their vote will affect EU policy, and either refrain from voting, giving a low turnout, or simply vote along party lines, rather than for anything as mundane as actual policies. I suspect the same is true in other EU countries. So if voters don't know who they're voting for, and don't know which policies they are voting for, then is it really a democracy?

Do we want a democracy? In democracies, people normally vote for their own self interest - to maximise their own economic gain. Is that what we want? What if the only way to avoid collapse is for us to all become poorer, to voluntarily lower our standard of living, not just for a single parliamentary term, but indefinitely? Could that possibly occur in a democracy? The majority of people consistently voting against their own best interests over an extended period of time? Is that remotely possible in a democracy? Or does democracy make a cohesive response to collapse impossible? Whilst I'm hesitant to recommend another system - as Churchill once remarked, ""democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.…', I'm at least willing to consider alternatives, and that is impossible within the EU.

How would the EU respond to collapse? We have already seen it treat Greece extremely badly in the wake of its recent financial disasters. An independent country in a similar position would have simply declared bankruptcy and got on with trying to rebuild its economy starting from a lower level. However the EU blocked that move, leaving Greece in a permanent state of debt slavery with liabilities it can never hope to repay. So what will happen in the future if there is another financial crisis? What if a major economy, such as Spain or Italy, finds itself in similar difficulties? Could the Euro even endure? It seems doubtful to me.

In the longer term the EU will face new challenges. With a few degrees of warming, many of its neighbours to the South and East will become far less hospitable. Egypt, Turkey and Iran have enormous populations, all within relatively easy migration range. What will happen to the populations of these countries when they become desolate, due to a combination of high temperatures, lack of water, warfare and collapse of local economies? Can the EU withstand the potential migration of hundreds of millions? In some ways I feel sorry for the immigrants of recent years, such as those from Syria. They are just ordinary people trying to survive in a hostile world, and in many ways demonised by the right. However accepting them creates a lobbying group that will push us to allow more new arrivals. If we believe that the states nearby will collapse then at some point we need to say ""No"" in order to defend ourselves, and that is easier done sooner than later.

So in summary, I don't accept the conventional liberal view of my country that the EU is my friend. I'd be quite happy to remain if it would mean everyone would shut up about the debate and let us focus instead on more important issues, but in the UK that is no longer an option. No matter what happens, the topic will continue to dominate debate for decades to come. So I feel like I'm obligated to take a side on the issue, but I can neither agree with the machinations of the right, or the liberal capitalist utopianism of the centre left. So I'm left in a limbo, unable to explain my position to those around me on one of the most important topics of the day without writing a two thousand word essay. That's hard to put across in a casual conversation.","2018-10-20 22:11:07","25","34","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9pyai8/my_thoughts_on_brexit_long/","True","cathartis","1747904890.6573758","CO2 is good","manual"
