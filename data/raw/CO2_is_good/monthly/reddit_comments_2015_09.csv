"cviviio","t3_3miiq4","3miiq4","environment","emotional","Gavin Schmidt, the current director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) commented on the 51 percent claim by Goodland and Anhang on the climate science outreach blog realclimate.org, where he notes: ""The report linked is nothing to do with the World Bank, rather it is a report from World Watch Institute – which I assume is some kind of NGO. Regardless, the reported numbers are nonsense – for instnace [sic], they count respiration as emissions (which makes no sense at all), and make a lot of unsupported assumptions. - See more at: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/07/unforced-variations-july/comment-page-4/#sthash.G9SihKot.dpuf""

Goodland and Anhang argue for using the 20 year GWP instead of the lower 100 year GWP, but they admit without explanation in their original paper that they only adjust the methane from livestock using the higher conversion factor to CO2 equivalent (the remaining adjustment for the remaining 63 percent of methane from sources unrelated to livestock is trivial, but would reduce the total share attributable to livestock). And not only do they include respiration, but they quietly ignore the estimate provided by the FAO in Livestock's Long Shadow, opting instead to (incorrectly) use a back-of-the-envelope estimate from a non-peer-reviewed editorial by Alan Calverd to obtain an estimate three times higher, which they further inflate by adjusting for increases in tonnage of livestock products nine years after the reference year (2000), without making similar adjustments for subsequent increases in emissions related to the energy sector.","2015-09-30 02:43:12","2","OnceJolly","1747867781.2692804","CO2 is good","manual"

Millions and millions of bison roaming the great plains of North America for thousands of years never caused an issue, while they were feeding on grasslands which acted not only as a massive carbon sink but which supported a massive, diverse ecosystem that is now largely gone, and have been replaced with petrochemical-reliant farmlands for less nutrition crops. It's almost like there are deeper, broader systemic issues at play here and that ""documentaries"" like these are pushed by people with veg*n agendas as they always attack symptoms, not causes.","2015-09-27 06:54:50","0","duplicitous","1747867781.2692804","CO2 is good","manual"

"cv0qjx4","t3_3ks5qv","3ks5qv","collapse","skeptical","The part of the atmosphere that we breathe is called the planetary boundary layer.  This is where c02 concentrations vary the most depending on how close you are to sources of c02, which hemisphere you're in, the season, etc., and c02 concentrations can be as high as 10x background concentration in certain areas.  The rising average c02 concentrations in earth's atmosphere is not that significant a factor in determining c02 in the air you breath, let alone the overall air quality.  In fact, air quality in general is much better today than it was 20 years ago due to the 1990 clean air act.","2015-09-14 02:31:36","3","8footpenguin","1747868224.9884014","CO2 is good","manual"
"cv07buh","t3_3ks5qv","3ks5qv","collapse","skeptical","If **all** fossil fuels were burnt, many inland parts of the tropics and subtropics would be uninhabitable due to physiologically intolerable temperatures, and much of the world between 10-40 degrees latitude would become unproductive deserts due to precipitation shifts and desertification. However, areas polewards of the Arctic and Antarctic circles would become more productive during their summers.

So most business as usual scenarios, greenhouse emissions threaten a mass extinction of specialist species, perhaps technological civilization, and bring sustainable human populations down to a few million, rather than a few billion. If there's enough ocean stratification so that ocean photic-zone euxinia is widespread, and hydrogen sulfide releases deplete the ozone layer (as occurred in past large igneous province-driven mass extinctions) then all bets are off.  If we get a Paleocene-Eocene-type thermal excursion, then some humans will survive. If we get a Permian-Triassic scale event, I doubt we've got a chance.

However, the outcome is determined more by indirect greenhouse sequellae (ocean stratification, etc) than by the direct effects of carbon dioxide on physiology.
