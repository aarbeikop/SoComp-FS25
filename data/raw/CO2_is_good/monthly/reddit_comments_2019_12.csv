I'll just point out that by 2040, the *expert* projection is that sea level in Florida will rise 14-26"".  That's not 3"".  Your estimate is about an order of magnitude wrong.

So something is seriously wrong with YOUR analysis.  The case you made is rational, logical and makes sense.  (It's just not valid, you have the essential details wrong.)

Just scanning this report, they are looking at *far more factors than you have considered.*  I won't repeat all the details, but I'll just pull a couple of quotes for you:

You said:

* ""Unless we see some very severe departure from the long term trend""

They say:

* found a significant acceleration in the rate of sea level rise since 2006.

&#x200B;

You said:

* Florida has been experiencying under 3 mm per year Sea Level Rise

They say:

* The average rate of regional sea level rise since 2006 is 9±4 mm/yr, significantly higher than the global average rate of 2.8±0.4 mm/yr

&#x200B;

Interestingly, the size of the effect from slowing oceans currents (all on its own) adds +3"" of sea level in Florida.    Then you have to consider the other factors like melting ice caps.  In other words, something you didn't even think to mention is as large as the one thing you are paying attention to.  You need to do some more in-depth research.

&#x200B;

Bottom line here, you cannot take a complex non-linear chaotic system like the climate/sea-level rise and correctly model that as if it's a simple linear function using grade 9 math...or else you might come up with total nonsense.

IF, hypothetically, the climate was a stable, equilibrium-seeking system, the approach you're taking (find a linear function that fits) *might* actually make some sense.  But we don't live in that universe.  Your approach is flawed.  But...you know...everyone has an *opinion*, right?","2019-12-30 17:57:45","1","fake-meows","1747916143.3325632","CO2 is good","manual"

Few people are going to take you seriously with your rambling vitriol, calling things stupid and garbage. Also, no one should take you seriously because you don't even think sea level is rising:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dyqhly/ocean\_level\_not\_rising/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dyqhly/ocean_level_not_rising/)

So it's not worth my time to go through your post in detail. However:

>**First you use the term NetZeroCO2e with no definition**

I don't see that in the report, perhaps the text search just didn't pick it up. However, it seems pretty clear even without context that this means net zero CO2 emissions. Also, in your link:

>The figure below reveals: The issue is that the simulation drops below zero. It is impossible to have negative emissions.

Wrong. If anthropogenic removals are larger than emissions, net carbon emissions are negative.

[https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15\_SPM\_version\_report\_LR.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf)

""Net emissions are defined as anthropogenic emissions reduced by anthropogenic removals.""

The link also complains about the report not defining ""net zero."" Really? Do you need them to define what ""mean"" and ""interquartile"" are as well?

Edit: Also, you think relative sea level is falling in Juneau, Alaska due to increased evaporation?

[http://cctruth.org/index.php/ocean-data/](http://cctruth.org/index.php/ocean-data/)

No. It's due to post-glacial rebound:

Does this mean if somehow we do end up stopping all emissions, this could decrease the pollution in the air (global dimming) and potentially make climate change worse? Or would global dimming levels stay the same? 

Does this mean, more than anything we need to be able to take carbon/methane out of the air, not just stop emitting entirely. Because if we stop emitting we lose/weaken the global dimming shied? Which would make the temperature increase? How long would global dimming maintain itself if all emissions were stopped?

Well fuck, lets hope it’s the latter scenario. 

> The fact that our planet is getting warmer even though aerosols are cooling it down at higher rates than previously thought brings us to a Catch-22 situation: Global efforts to improve air quality by developing cleaner fuels and burning less coal could end up harming our planet by reducing the number of aerosols in the atmosphere, and by doing so, diminishing aerosols' cooling ability to offset global warming.

>According to Rosenfeld, another hypothesis to explain why Earth is getting warmer even though aerosols have been cooling it down at an even a greater rate is a possible warming effect of aerosols when they lodge in deep clouds, meaning those 10 kilometers or more above the Earth.
