Yes  Professor Kevin Anderson speaks to this in just about every lecture he gives on YouTube  well worth  a listen  He actually lays the blame at the feet of scientist,  journalists etc and the environmental movement itself e.g. Greenpeace,  for their willful degredation via flying. 

Kevin asks has a blog here and had a paper in Nature were he highlights this

Another climate scientist discusses it here

>Hour for hour, there’s no better way to warm the planet than to fly in a plane. If you fly coach from Los Angeles to Paris and back, you’ve just emitted 3 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, 10 times what an average Kenyan emits in an entire year. Flying first class doubles these numbers.

>I even have a friend who blogged on the importance of bringing reusable water bottles on flights in order to pre-empt the miniature disposable bottles of water the attendants hand out. Although she saved around 0.04 kilograms of CO2 by refusing the disposable bottle, her flight to Asia emitted more than 4,000 kilograms, equivalent to some 100,000 bottles","2018-01-29 08:01:41","4","Capn_Underpants","1747892984.966313","CO2 is good","manual"
"dtej1p1","t3_7tqf3k","7tqf3k","environment","emotional","I travelled to Canada quite often from the 1970s to early 2000s.

By doing so, I guess I caused more than enough damage to the atmosphere, so I quit air travel altogether. If I can't get somewhere by train, I stay away.

And I indeed found that Europe and Canada are far more similar today than they were 40 years ago: Same food, same cars, same supermarkets... I've seen the nice nature, been there, done that. Air travel has been awful the last times anyway: Insane ""security"" measures, planes getting more and more cramped... I don't miss that one bit.

Downside: I won't see my Canadian relatives again. But the environment is perhaps more important.","2018-01-29 07:55:54","3","ebikefolder","1747892984.966313","CO2 is good","manual"

"dtf50oo","t3_7tqf3k","7tqf3k","environment","emotional","This is something I think about all the time as both a travel addict and an environmentalist. To answer your question, yes traveling is environmentally unfriendly, but in the same way that just about every other aspect of modern life is. Everything you likely do in your regular daily life, like commuting and eating pre-prepared foods has an environmental cost as well. Unfortunately that's kind of just the way it is until we can figure out this sustainability thing as a species. So, the way I figure it, I might as well do what I love and see the world in spite of the cost and do things in my daily life to try to do my part to partially make up for it. I also make a habit of cleaning up litter whenever I see it, so that's another way I can give back when I travel places. Also, travel is a significant way to develop yourself, and helps you gain a greater appreciation for the environment that we are trying to protect. I say if you want to travel then you definitely should, as long as you do so as responsibly as you can. ","2018-01-29 17:37:51","1","snaggletooth102","1747892984.966313","CO2 is good","manual"

"ds6xsfn","t3_7o4ytg","7o4ytg","collapse","skeptical","Who know what is good or bad, truly?  A collapse of one kind might prevent a collapse of another.  An economic collapse might prevent an ecological collapse.  A civil collapse where race and social class turn on each other might be caused by - or even prevented by - a collapse of the world's political order.  A fossil fuel collapse might cascade into and agricultural collapse, into full blown social collapse, into eventual extinction of our species, or it just might mean that we use horse and buggy.  Who knows?  Certainly, anyone claiming to have knowledge of what is actually going to happen is basing their conclusion on limited data.

In the end, we can only gather information and make personal choices based off of what we think is right for each of us.  Collapse would probably be accompanied by massive loss of humanity, but those who survived the fall might have it better than the billions being crushed by the current state of the modern world.","2018-01-04 19:50:10","18","torras21","1747893356.2299538","CO2 is good","manual"

1. Some kind of transhumanist nightmare where the one percent heads off on advanced spaceships to colonize the universe, leaving the rest of us to die.

2. We all go extinct.

Our only other option, as average people, is to fight for major institutional changes in how the world is governed and how wealth is distributed. We have until about 2030 before it will be too late, in my estimation. Historian Peter Turchin estimates things will start to get really unstable in the 20's. That will be our time to attack.

"dsvq2cp","t3_7rb807","7rb807","collapse","skeptical","Thanks for telling me about your site & podcast (listening now) and don't worry about being 'qualified'. Some of the people who are qualified are bullshitting the public in various ways for a number of reasons (not nefarious).

The thing with telling family & friends is it's all but hopeless and you risk trashing relationships. It's not because they are stupid (anymore stupid than the rest of us) or immoral or lack access to information. It's mostly about human cognitive biases. When it comes to changing peoples minds it's specifically about  'The Backfire Effect'.

**The Backfire Effect**

**The Misconception**: When your beliefs are challenged with facts, you alter your opinions and incorporate the new information into your thinking.

**The Truth**: When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger.

https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/

There are plenty of blogs and podcasts on psychology and cognitive biases, but I have yet to see a podcast that discusses them in relation to collapse - there you go.

I wasn't aware of the ROS issue; I'll be posting the studies you linked to over on /r/doomsdaycult, thanks.

If I could suggest a possible future topic, you might want to cover the various different factors affecting infant mortality. The survival of our species is going to depend on how well infants can gestate and develop in the environment we're creating, and studies are starting to show that there are already problems developing. This ties into the CO2 issue pretty closely, but it also encompasses air pollution and the effects of temperature on gestation.
