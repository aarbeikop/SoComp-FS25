Coral reefs around the world are dying with the Great Barrier Reef taking a major hit this year. Ocean acidification attacking the shells of  small plankton could cripple some of the oceans food chains. Oyster farmers in the NW US cannot start oysters in the ocean because it is too acidic already so they have to be started in tanks on land.
Northern areas are getting much less snow and for shorter periods which is changing the albedo along with the melting sea ice.

Still with all this information about half the population still does not understand what is coming down the pipe and how quickly.

Climate change videos on YouTube don't have many visits but Katy Perry videos get 1.3 billion views. I can't believe how many of my friends still just don't get it at all.

Soldiers fought and died for our freedom in WW2 in horrid conditions. Our generation won't even look at climate change information. It's not that we tried and failed - most people were too weak to look or too stupid to listen.

If we are seeing this much change now with a with 1 degree change I feel so sorry for young people as large feed backs such as the loss of the reflective ice and snow in the north and Arctic will continue to ramp up, and as the article states the warming is accelerating quickly.

"d1mfvqd","t3_4cyian","4cyian","collapse","skeptical","When it comes to climate change, it seems to me that there's the stuff we pretty much know or can guess at, that we base our projections on, and there's the stuff we don't know.  The problem is that the stuff we don't know is more likely to be bad news than good news.  Sort of like, if your car is starting to have a lot of mechanical problems due to being poorly maintained or old, and you do a full inspection on it, you're more likely to add more problems to the list than take problems off it.  

We're starting from a standpoint of ""the earth before our meddling is perfect because it's the environment we evolved to survive in, and anything we do to change it is probably bad."" Just like ""the car from the factory is in ideal condition and anything we inadvertently do to it is probably bad.""

Therefor, since there's still a lot we don't know about climate change, we can pretty much assume that ""it's worse than current projections based on established science would lead us to believe.""

Of course, there is the possibility of discovering good news, but on the whole, as we add things to the list of ""things we now know that we have done to the world"" it just seems logical that most will be negative changes rather than inadvertently making the world *more* like the ideal condition we started off with.  Does that make sense to anyone else?  It's sort of how I have started viewing environmental science.","2016-04-01 23:53:35","25","8footpenguin","1747874523.62523","CO2 is good","manual"

Attempts at geo-engineering projects are going have a lot of unintended, possibly **entirely negative or worsening** consequences - including projects that show initial early promise, but swing things in the wrong direction a few decades later (just think of how global dimming from pollution is actually keeping temperature rises down right now). Once such projects are announced, every company will want to profit off of the cash being tossed at ""saving the planet"". But funding and resources earmarked for such misaligned efforts would necessarily starve other less-popular proposals that may stand a better chance of actually working.

Just look at China's attempts at afforestation to combat desertification. This paper has page after page that reveal decades of work to combat desertification through planting forests has led to unintended consequences: unsuitable tree species planted, depleted water tables, erosion, a low survival rate, reduced biodiversity, and in some cases further desertification - but China's Bureau of Forestry has a vested interest in keeping their budget and personnel:

I agree we do have to try to minimize our participation in the economy and subvert it, if possible.

(""Degrow"" is the polite term people use when they don't want to freak everyone out) It will be horrible. It will truly devastating. But at least we may be alive at the end of it all. Unless global dimming predictions are accurate, then we will actually heat up drastically once the pollution stops. (Pollution is keeping the world cooler than it would be otherwise)

There is zero, zero, zero way that a democratic society would vote for its own decline. So my thinking is that there will have to be a conspiracy of the world's economic and political leaders who, in the name of humanity, will sabotage the world economy. They will have to do it *very fast* and make it appear like they aren't intending to do so. They won't do it because they are evil; they will do it because they are good.

The only other option is a technological singularity of the kind Dmitry Itskov wants. We must immediately prepare for a post-human future in which we upload ourselves into non-biological robots that can survive without ecosystems, food, or water. In short, we must begin preparations to live on an alien planet--our own.

I imagine that in the next decade or two, those with the wealth and means will begin this transition--to become fully robotic on this planet and/or escape to the Moon, Mars, etc. The rest will burn in endless wildfires.

"d20icd4","t3_4eg397","4eg397","collapse","skeptical","Each year, we're emitting about 30x as much carbon as the living planet can sequester. So every year we're 29 gigatons behind Earth's own carbon sequestering capacity. The year after, 29 more gigatons. Ten years from now, even if emission levels don't rise, we're 290 gigatons above the 1 gigaton/year that would be naturally sequestered. 

The more this happens, the more the systems sequestering that carbon stop functioning. Carbon dioxide 'lasts' in the atmosphere for a very long time. Methane doesn't last as long, but it's 30-50x as potent. 

Of course, as it gets 'hotter', we'll see more methane released, more forest fires, more drought, fewer trees growing, more fires, etc. 

Your sentiment agrees with one I heard some time ago with respect to ""buy nothing day"", by Adbusters. The critique, whose authorship I forget, said basically that buying nothing for a day doesn't do a thing. Nor would it for a year. People buying nothing for a year would buy a lot before their 'year' started, and would maybe binge in the year after. The big thing would be ""earn nothing year"", which would kick the economy in its self-destructive ass. 

Modern society doesn't like people saying these things. Individuals get scared when their ontology (the fundamental viewpoint about the nature of reality that they have; note, this doesn't imply they are ""Right"" but that this is the foundation of their worldview) is shaken. So if you tell someone that food in the grocery store is causing cancer, and the economy is based on conflict minerals, rainforest destruction, modern day factory slavery, and exploitation, they don't like that. Groups of people in institutions don't like that. They'd like you to get another credit card, max it out on televisions and Ikea furniture. 

What I wish for the remainder of my own life is that I can find a way to grow and develop the relationships that mean something to me. That I may choose healthy lifestyle habits, and that I get to find some meaning, even if it is small (i.e. relevant to just me, or those close to me). I am working to get out of debt. I would like to find some land somewhere, far from factories, cities, large populations, toxic groundwater, and so forth.

When you say a group of people have or should have a set of priorities it doesn't make sense. You have a priority. I have a priority. Martha Stewart has her priorities. This is your fundamental flaw in this entire line of thought.

If every human being dies, or all life on earth for that matter, it is neither good nor bad. It just is. There is no built-in setting in the universe for these things. Any sentiment you display about the need to limit growth or 'go back to nature' or something like that, it is because you, personally, feel better about that alternative than the current state of the world.

If you would actively work to destroy the economy and were in any measure successful, you are just as guilty as Mr. Tom Industrialist Polluter in intervening in the course of 'nature.' By designing to change the state of things you are no longer living 'in the hands of the gods' so-to-speak. Maybe the course of human history is as natural as anything else that has ever happened. Maybe other alien civilizations have all seen a similar series of events. Who knows?
