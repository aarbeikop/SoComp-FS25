"3coya2","climate","scientific","I'm creating a giant compendium of climate change data. Might anyone help?","This is inspired by a comment I came across a few months ago that I can't find. It basically slapped down a climate change denier by listing an *absurd* number of links to proof that climate change is occurring. No idea where it is now, but I've decided to recreate it.

Common denier trick: you can cherry pick the hottest year earlier in recent decades (1998, when a strong el nino meant a hot year) and compare it to the coolest year in recent decades (2008, when a strong la nina meant a cool year)

> Lie: ""Liberal lefties use newspeak to hide their agenda; global warming becomes climate change""

>Truth: It was Frank Lutz, the famous GOP pollster/operative, who in 2003 championed the use of ""climate change"" rather than global warming, because it sounds so much gentler and non-threatening. It's was the softest term available for catastrophic climate disruption (the more accurate term). ""We"" didn't change it. You speak of trust. Who deserves the trust of average people? The pollsters, paid liars, PR agents, front groups, and shills? Frank Lutz wrote: ""It’s time for us to start talking about “climate change” instead of global warming and “conservation” instead of preservation. 1) “Climate change” is less frightening than “global warming”. As one focus group participant noted, climate change “sounds like you’re going from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale.” While global warming has catastrophic connotations attached to it, climate change suggests a more controllable and less emotional challenge.""
