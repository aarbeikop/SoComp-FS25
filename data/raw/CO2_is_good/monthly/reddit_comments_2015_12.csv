2. True, but we have shown ourselves to be good at finding new oil and other fossil fuel sources. The end is inevitable, but may not come soon enough to be the solution to our problem. 

3. Kinda. Hydropower is indeed awful, but wind and solar are not, and there are other options (like geothermal and tidal energy) that have not been fully developed yet. There will be a cost to all of these, but it could be lower than the cost we're paying now.

4. Ok. Desalinization is expensive and inefficient. Water use efficiency is cheap and effective and works with existing technologies. 

5. Yes, overfishing and the loss of marine habitat is a big deal. Probably not time to give up entirely on life, however. The linked paper extrapolates a trend to say that ""This trend is of serious concern because it projects the global collapse of all taxa currently fished by the mid-21st century (based on the extrapolation of
regression in Fig. 3A to 100% in the year 2048)."" which is a *very* different statement than ""All salt water fish extinct by 2048"". 

6. True enough, but I don't see how this is unchangeable or inherently disastrous. It's hardly fair to pin the erasure of the middle class on that transformation, given that the middle class was more or less created by that transformation. 

These are big problems, and require big actions, so I agree that ""watching your carbon footprint"" is not terribly effective, and implies that individual action is more important than collective action. But we've dealt with big problems before, so I'm not going to throw up my hands just yet. We'll lose some stuff. We've made mistakes. Giving up now would be a mistake that would dwarf all the ones that proceeded it. ","2015-12-08 01:09:58","3","fishsticks40","1747870313.3293123","CO2 is good","manual"
