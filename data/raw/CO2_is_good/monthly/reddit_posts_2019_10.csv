——

I recently encountered a climate change denier in the wild and thought, “You know what, there are plenty of reputable sources out there that agree that climate change is real and being caused by humans. I’m going to collect a list of those sources and show them to this person.”

So I did, and I wanted to share this mega list with you, to better arm you to help people accept what is happening to our planet. So here goes:

EDIT: a lot of these sources also talk about the causes of climate change, and the fact that climate change is being primarily caused by human CO2 emissions. Many also cover additional evidence of human caused climate change.","2019-10-27 22:59:04","168","134","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/do0jlg/heres_a_megalist_of_reputable_sources_proving/","True","TheJoshWatson","1747914402.6616998","CO2 is good","manual"

I have a friend, my best friend, who is getting married very soon (2 weeks from now)

She is from Canada, he is from Italy (like me, sorry for my bad english!)

She live(ed) in canada, he is living in France, now they will live together in France.

As a gift, my wife and I would like to make a poster with various graphics showing how their marriage is absolutely eco-friendly (they are both vegan and absolutely careful to impact the environment as little as possible), and then compare a bit of parameters indicating how much CO2 goes to save, or how much less resources they waste ... for example:

\- trips to go to visit each-other (2 times every year) -> -50kg CO2 / year

\- phone calls -> 5???? CO2 / year

\- take a shower together -> -10 l / day of water

would you help me find some good parameters, maybe even fun? and above all: how to calculate the kg of CO2 that each activity generates? there are databases, sites, other?

thank you so much","2019-10-07 13:11:33","20","3","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dej8n0/an_idea_for_marriages_gift/","True","teorematista","1747914533.7761762","CO2 is good","manual"
"dhwxrn","climate","scientific","decarbonized fossil energy: friend or foe in climate fight?","Hi,

This is a question I personally have been wrestling with. I get that it will take time to complete the energy transition and that capturing more CO2 in the meantime at point of emission will help a lot. But I also get how critics worry that CCS will give fossil fuel companies an excuse to slow roll the needed and inevitable transition even more, and keep right on digging.

Anyway, great longform discussion on this topic on this podcast with Deepika Nagabhushan, the program director of decarbonized fossil energy at Clean Air Task Force. Just sharing, in case anyone else wants to learn more about this topic.

Also, there seems to be no good place for a podcast to have discussion/debate around the episodes, so I am wondering if reddit may be a good candidate to fill that void.

Here it is....

"ditj4w","collapse","skeptical","Bioweapon / Pandemic incoming?","I think that there is a very real possibility that before 2040 there may be an artificially orchestrated pandemic to kill off a billion people or so. Think about it. Not only this results in a billion of people less to produce for and a drop in birth rates, but also during the pandemic and in its aftermath there will be less people traveling and less trade of physical goods going on. Most people will readily accept lower standard of living and giving more control to the governments. This will massively decrease Co2 emissions and help with conserving the resources.

Plus, the pandemic may be targeted, to be more effective on certain ethnicities. Which if possible and if the elites are even a little bit xenophobic will probably be attempted.

Now, I know that I sound like a psychopath, but the thing is most of the rich & powerful are psychopaths. Most of them surely understand where we are heading and that if nothing drastic is undertaken, life is gonna get really shitty for everyone, them included.

EDIT: On March 29, 2020, I changed 2040 to 2030 in order to “increase accuracy” of the prediction. I am a douche for doing so and regret it. Also originally I wanted to write 2030, but in my mind I wanted to give myself some hope and delay this. By writing 2040 I was trying to calm myself by thinking that I probably still have time to properly prepare for what’s to come. Instead I was caught with my pants down by COVID-19, being stuck abroad, far from my family and friends.","2019-10-16 18:31:46","14","21","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ditj4w/bioweapon_pandemic_incoming/","True","Argy007","1747915159.8462195","CO2 is good","manual"
"dhgwp2","sustainability","action-oriented","A better alternative to ""You should not do [bad-for-environment thing]""","I think there's a better way to phrase this when talking to people.

""Don't do that, it's bad for the environment"" is blunt and may be factually correct, but the sentiment that the choice is all theirs to have to make, with no help from you, is both unproductive and not very nice.

For example, ""You shouldn't have driven here, that produces a lot of CO2"" is factually true, but if I were on the receiving end of this statement, it wouldn't make me feel good.

""Is this more eco-friendly option available to you?"" doesn't assume that they aren't already feeling guilty about taking a less environmentally-friendly option. Though unlikely, they might not have any other good options. This phrasing also is open to an I-can-help-you attitude, compared to the sentiment that they must do it all themselves.

For example, ""You know, I think there are bus routes along your commute, would it have worked to take those?"" If the bus isn't actually an option, oh well. If the bus is an option, great! And your sentiment makes it easier to help by figuring out the logistics of the route, or money for passes, etc.

Just a showerthought. Feel free to criticize/discuss.","2019-10-13 21:31:51","5","5","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dhgwp2/a_better_alternative_to_you_should_not_do/","True","quaris628","1747915216.600582","CO2 is good","manual"
