I have recently been flying a couple of times because of my job and I'm looking at the most efficient way (ton/$) to offset my carbon emissions. I came across [this article](https://thepointsguy.com/2018/01/the-basics-of-offsetting-the-carbon-emissions-from-your-flights/) that led me to [myclimate.org](https://co2.myclimate.org/en/portfolios?calculation_id=1159477) and [goldstandard.org](https://www.goldstandard.org/get-involved/make-an-impact) both offering me to pay around 12$/ton for climate projects worldwide. I'm kind of lost because:

* I don't know how much confidence I can have into the figures from those projects? 
* I don't know if there are better solutions?
 
I'm also planning on planting some fast-growing trees but again I don't know if this is a good idea or useless. 

I read http://www.drawdown.org/ last year and it seems that there may be some smart investments to do in some projects but I don't know any of them.

If someone can help me having a better vision on this topic, that would be awesome =).
