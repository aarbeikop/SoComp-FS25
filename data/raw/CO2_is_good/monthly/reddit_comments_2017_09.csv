Humans are impervious to small changes which is one of the reasons it is so hard to feel climate change sometimes. I'm glad you have realised the devastating impact of it and decided to act. But remember that it is very easy to forget it exists once we see normal weather again, but remember it is always lurking until the next big event.

"dmr2g4d","t3_6ywwp2","6ywwp2","climatechange","action-oriented","First off, I'm glad you're starting to take anthropogenic climate change (ACC) seriously. It's an issue that will ultimately determine the fate of human civilization and the more awareness we create the better our grandchildren's and their grandchildren's chances of having lives as nice as ours. 

The fires, hurricanes, etc. that we see going on right now are not directly caused by climate change nor do they lie outside the confidence intervals of what we could expect even without any anthropogenic forcing of climate. These things are all possible regardless of climate change and we can't say that ACC is the cause of any one event. Heck, the 35,000 acre fire here in Portland was started by some fucking teenager. So that's probably why anyone who properly understands the science (most likely a large portion of the people on this sub) aren't freaking out right now. 

With that said, the probability of events like these occurring in any given year is increasing. The average severity of these events is increasing as well. The reason that people aren't properly freaking out about this part is that the trend isn't yet strong enough to be noticed by the average joe and can be partially explained by natural variability. The other reason is that these changes in probability are slow. We may not have seen a statistically significant increase in '100 year storms' in the last 70 years, but 100-200 years from now, a storm that would have occurred once every 50-100 years may occur every 10-20 years and our civilization (and world) will be significantly burdened with adapting. 

This isn't just limited to storms though. Another reason people aren't panicking is due to the complexity of the problem. We've already seen that subtle changes in regional environments alone can cause significant, lasting, and unexpected disruption to natural equilibria. With the blanket, world-wide change we've made to one of the most basic and underpinning predictors of environmental stability (the atmosphere) we can expect increasingly complex, systematic, and difficult challenges to present themselves (over the course of centuries, mind you) in a cascading fashion (see: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure). The problem with recognizing these types of failures before they reach their asymptotic stage (where it's simply too late to hope to stop it) is that it requires a thorough understanding of how the system works. We have trouble predicting cascading failures even in simple, man-made systems (the power grid is a great example) so it's understandable that we don't know exactly how quickly things will spiral out of control when it comes to something as complex and slow-moving as global climate. Frankly, we won't know (on a collective level) that we're screwed until its way too late to do anything about it and we don't know how far along that path to getting screwed we are right now. Now I'm not saying that things aren't getting worse or that what we're seeing is normal. We just haven't had enough of these extreme events close enough together for a long enough period of time for the science-literate people to start pointing at the sky saying ""are you fucking convinced now?!"". 

Regardless, we need to prepare for events like this to become more and more common in the future. This means educating everyone we can as much as we can and it means organizing in an inclusive and non-combative way to summon the political will to steer our civilization toward a brighter future than the one we're headed for.

But to the heart of your question, I created this sub to be something of a grown-ups table for climate discussion. The expectation is that people here understand climate reasonably well and can have civil discussions about it. That's why rule #1 is there ------------>

When people get panicky, they lose their ability to reason and end up in flamewars. Reddit's already rife with that sort of bullshit, so this sub is a place that tries to defy that.","2017-09-09 15:37:53","3","Will_Power","1747889376.1988294","CO2 is good","manual"
