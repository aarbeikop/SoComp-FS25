This even will take place over several hundred. Neither nature nor organisms can adapt over a course of hundreds of years.

How do you ensure the ecosystem stays stable?

"e94gvr6","t3_9ucixu","9ucixu","climatechange","action-oriented","If you spend just a little time reading past posts in this forum, you'll see that this question is a constant refrain here. The frequency with which this question arises — plus the reuse of similar themes, and sometimes language — strongly suggests the work of bots or other automated/rote posting accounts...on some occasions. 

So: Repeating here my comment from [another post on a similar topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9tyuny/my_eyes_have_been_opened_and_i_cant_close_them/e90iwub/):

***

In a word, the solution is: Adaptation.

Which people are pretty good at in the long run, as long as we have access to some key tools: science, technology, finance, and a modest amount of global coordination.

Technology is a big one. Eventually technology will develop solutions to three problems:

1) Making fossil fuels a minor source of energy supply, instead of a major one like they are now.

2) Finding a way to extract and sequester the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

3) Making the global climate a tunable environment, like a laboratory or a manmade lake or your bedroom.

The question is, how quickly will these problems encounter technological fixes? #3 probably isn't happening in this century, but seems possible for the next. #1 and #2 are unpredictable, but it's reasonable to guess that major strides will be made in this century.

In the meantime, technology will also be needed to enable populations to adjust to some local phenomena:

1) Sea-level rise, by investing in coastal defense. (A technology which has existed for millennia.)

2) Ocean acidification.

3) Ecosystem pressures, possibly including some collapses. These could be severe, although note that ecosystems have collapsed in the past and civilization has adjusted well enough to those.

4) A higher-energy troposphere, which might mean more severe storms.

The financial system is an integral part of developing the necessary technologies, making the necessary investments, and possibly developing the necessary global coordination. In fact, for now burning fossil fuels is probably also an integral part of that process.

There's more than technology needed, of course. There's also a great need to amass huge amounts of data — so climate risks and fixes can be properly modeled and priced, for instance. Most of that data isn't available now, but amassing it in the future is another part of the solution.

But again, the solution condensed into a single word is: Adaptation. Which people are pretty good at, once a pressing need develops. If you are very concerned about climate risks, then you'll be constantly improving capacities to adapt — yours, and your society's.

The climate is not one of the top hundred most important influences on your life decisions. It might not even be in the top thousand. Its influence could easily be negligible.

Anyone who decides not to start a family will get full encouragement from me; I think plenty of people make ill-considered decisions about that. But regardless of my encouragement, you should invest in whatever makes you feel happy and fulfilled, and enables you to play a constructive role in helping other people reach their goals.

Also here's another comment on a similar topic:

[It's fair to say that technology will continue to advance, and the problem of excess atmospheric CO2 is not insoluble in principle. Inevitably one day we'll have the ability to tune the composition of the atmosphere, if we wish. But the main complication is: We have a lot of other civilization-level problems to solve, many of them extremely urgent, and the vast majority of our technological resources are going to be dedicated to addressing those problems (as they should be).](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/97rzul/technology_might_still_save_us/e4aj79h/).

And this one too:

[The endgame — for the second half of the 21st century, let's say — is: Global economic growth will slowly converge with its historical average. Technology advances will continue to accelerate mildly. These trends will continue to be partially obscured by exogenous shocks of varying disruptiveness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e6700hr/)

And amplifying that one:

[Really, climate change is not greatly different than a lot of exogenous shocks that have existed for centuries, and which we tend to feel (and measure) in economic conditions first. My answer is just a summary of economic orthodoxy of the post-WWII era — there's nothing original in it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e672k83/)

And more about the process of climate adaptation:

[Adaptation is unquestionably the best strategy for confronting climate issues — at least until the global climate system is understood well enough to be predictably altered via relatively modest steps. (An achievement which is at least several decades in the future, maybe a century.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9j2oum/deep_adaption_in_bloomberg_businessweek/e6r09av/)

And finally, a possible way to frame realistic optimism: 

[Real climate remediation is only going to be possible as long as it stays within limits set by some very compelling civilizational priorities:
1) The need for economic growth, primarily to combat poverty ¶ 2) The need for people to access ways to optimize their own health, whether that means vaccination, healthcare or eating meat ¶ 3) The need to respect basic human rights, represented here by the freedom to produce as many offspring as each individual chooses](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9rk3id/looking_for_case_studies_people_who_quit_or_cut/e8huebo/)","2018-11-05 22:34:44","1","DocHarford","1747905110.6869214","CO2 is good","manual"

"eacwimm","t3_9zy731","9zy731","environment","emotional","The issue here isn't whether or not you personally can drop your average personal emissions to half of what they would be by not eating meat or using LEDs.  Every person in the US can stop eating meat, switch to LEDs, and buy locally and it won't do enough to have a measurable effect on the temperature outside.

We, in the US, produce... well it used to be 15% of the world's CO2 emissions, but we've continued to fall and the developing world has grown faster than we've fallen, so... we'll call it 12% of the emissions.  Agriculture (all of it) is less than 20% of the cause of our emissions.  [Animal Agriculture is about 13%](https://skepticalscience.com/animal-agriculture-meat-global-warming.htm).  This estimate is different depending on which source you use, Green Eatz [claims households produce 48 tons per year, and food makes up 8 of that](http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html). I suppose it's not impossible that 13 of that 17% could be because of the meat eaten by the household. Plant-based agriculture is not without CO2 implications, so switching to plant based will only reduce the emissions, not eliminate it, but if meat is responsible for three-quarters of the food based total, or 6 tons per family, and a quarter of 6 is 1.5, the family would go from 8 tons of food based CO2 emissions to 3.5 tons. Per capita, that's a decent sized reduction.  

We have already dropped our overall emissions rate by about 17%. We actually lead the world in reductions, from about 20 tons per person to about 16 tons per person. What if we, in the US and other developed nations, drop our emissions down to the level of most developing nations. What if we, in the US, could cut our emissions **in half** in the next decade. That would be great, right?

The problem is that there are 300 million of us.  There are 400 million Europeans. We, together, make up about 10% of the world's population, and the VAST majority of that 90% is not reducing their emissions, they are growing. And they will continue to grow for the next decade, at the very least.  If they grow by 2% per year, and we reduce ours by 10% per year, their emissions growth will outpace our reductions.

We have told them ""you have the right to develop.""  Economic fairness wins out against an *existential threat* in popular debate every time.  We argue that being fair to them, and letting them develop, is non-negotiable, at the very same time we say that continuing to grow will certainly destroy the ecosystem and doom us all.  We've *chosen* to allow economic growth of the developing world to end civilization and cause human extinction.

So, by policy, we've decided that we're going to go through the motions while the developing world loads the gun and fires the bullet that will end us. My question is, why are we bothering?","2018-11-24 13:30:08","3","deck_hand","1747905293.4696927","CO2 is good","manual"
