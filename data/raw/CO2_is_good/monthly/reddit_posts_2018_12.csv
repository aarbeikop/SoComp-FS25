"a4snzx","climatechange","action-oriented","How to effectively discuss climate change with deniers and skeptics [What are their clearest outlined criticisms?]","I want to understand the camp that either criticizes the existence or extent of climate change. It's hard to do so because some of the popular claims I have heard aren't very specific. If there are more substantive claims, please let me know.

Claim 1: Climate change doesn't exist

My criticism with this claim is that it doesn't offer any context, so the only assumption that I can make is that they are making a very ignorant, unscientific claim that they don't believe the climate doesn't change *at all*. Even if they were saying that the planet suffered no deleterious impacts, that would be inconsistent with documented evidence. I can only imagine that only a minute amount of people making this actual claim...but perhaps a larger group of people are trying to say something else. What that might be, I am unsure because the claim seems to rest on this vague and limited wording.

&#x200B;

Claim 2: The climate changes, but isn't ""man-made"" or ""man-caused.""

&#x200B;

I am not sure how this can be asserted either since there are deleterious effects that can be directly connected to unnaturally occurring events that caused negative impacts on the planet (i.e. Deep Horizon oil spill or CFCs depleting the ozone layer)

&#x200B;

Of the people I've talked to that are skeptical about what science says about climate change, I haven't heard anything in detail that they refute or reject that is in detail...or that isn't one of the two above arguments.

&#x200B;

CC skeptics that I've talked with don't offer a clearly outlined or thought out claim that they believe that could be subject to examination and refutation. I am unsure if this is done deliberately so there position is unassailable or if it's because of an inability to articulate one's position.

&#x200B;

The end result either way is that you aren't able to disprove or refute their claim if there isn't a clear understanding of what they think climate change is and what they don't accept about it. So it's unproductive to discuss without them clarifying their stance.

&#x200B;

So I am hoping to get feedback on what you all have heard in your process of learning about CC, and how to best discuss CC with someone who is skeptical, but isn't offering a good reason to validate their skepticism.","2018-12-10 05:12:35","10","84","0.74","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/a4snzx/how_to_effectively_discuss_climate_change_with/","True","Semitar1","1747905884.1071055","CO2 is good","manual"
"a7l4w7","climatechange","action-oriented","Which climate scientists have most influenced you?","I'll share a list of mine and some highlights of how they have shaped my understanding.

1. John Tyndall

Over 150 years ago, he demonstrated the greenhouse effect of GHG's like CO2. 


2. James Hansen

Generally, his passion for the topic has caused me to dig deeper.


3. Dr. Jennifer Francis - Rutgers

Her explanation of how climate change is effecting weather patterns, specifically via altering the Jet Stream and Circumpolar wind currents resulting in stuck weather patterns (more extreme rainfall and heat waves)

4. Karen Pistone

Led a 2014 study quantifying the impact of lost albedo in the Arctic which concluded that lost albedo was causing warming equivalent to 50% of all cumulative anthropogenic emissions.

5. Dr. Eric Rignot - NASA and UCI

His specialty is the satellite and radar measurement of the cryosphere. A few years back he claimed that big portions of W. Antarctica were melting irreversibly. Digging into this claim and understanding the ocean / ice interface and the topography under the ice sheets tipped me into a heightened concern about climate change 2 years ago.

Some of his work incorporates the work of Jennifer Francis and the understanding of how changing ocean currents are bringing warm water to the ice sheets.

6. DeConto and Pollard

Developed the theory of Marine Ice Sheet Instability which is a potential missing link in understanding how ice sheets can rapidly disintegrate as they have in recent geologic past. ~ 15k years ago, sea levels rose ~ 1 foot per decade for ~ 500 years. 

That ice is now long gone and we won't see an exact repeat of that. But they have put together a lot of elements which help modelers reconcile their warming models to past sea level rise. 

The proof will be in the data in the coming decade or two. Just a theory for now.

7. Dr. Kerry Emanuel MIT

His specialty is in extreme weather and hurricane prediction. His work points to more intense and wet storms resulting from climate change, albeit with less storm formation intensity. 

8. Jeff Donnelly, Woods Hole

Has made strides in paleo-evidence of hurricane activity. Using ocean holes where sediments collect, he's able to reconstruct storm activity for several millennia. Combining that with oxygen isotope ratios which enable a reconstruction of ocean temperatures, a solid relationship between storm intensity and ocean temperature.

9. Charles Keeling and historical CO2 mappers. 

CO2 isn't the only GHG, but it's a good proxy. Understanding the GHG's are at a 5M year high and likely to hit a 20M year high in my lifetime is pretty significant. 

That's my core list. I'm interested to add to that list based upon the feedback of others.

I do not think that climate change is not happening but it seems very hard to get a good idea of the scale of the change when good scientists have good arguments backed by data on both sides.

&#x200B;

Any good recent articles that adresses all the CON arguments and data and why they may not be right? It's already very easy to find arguments on the PRO side.","2018-12-18 17:43:27","0","25","0.45","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/a7dadm/any_good_recent_article_refuting_climate_change/","True","fastfwd","1747905951.727791","CO2 is good","manual"
"a2ctzd","climate","scientific","Becoming a politician to stop global warming?","Am I completely insane or is this something I can realistically achieve with hard work?

Iv'e just finished year 12 in Australia, a country with one of the highest CO2 emissions per capita in the world. I already do the little things to decrease my personal emissions, now I want to work towards a career where I contribute to reducing Australia's impact on global warming. 

Long story short, engineering is not for me, and neither is scientific research in labs. These fields can lead to developments in reducing CO2 emissions. Another option is politics, which clearly has an enormous impact on the environment. 

I believe that if I set my mind to it, I could actually become a politician and make a larger difference than I ever could by simply living green and donating money to charities.

"a2ds9d","climate","scientific","Is climate change really a big deal?","First off I do know that man-made climate change is very real and I'm not a denier/moron.

The government report on climate change says that in the **worst-case** scenario, the US will lose more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century.

And I'm like... so what? Why should that have me worrying for humanity? Why should a drop of 1.3% in dairy production one century from now be of any concern to anyone? I mean in the past when I though of climate change I thought that maybe in 2040 or 2050 human civilization would start to collapse, apocalyptic wars over water would be fought, billions would die from heat, starvation, etc... In reality all it does is some minor and barely noticeable economic recession... an entire century away.

"a3rv0h","climate","scientific","Online emissions calculator that aims to raise awareness about air pollution","Hello!

I'm a developer from Oblik Studio (Bulgaria) and we recently launched our non-profit project Mission Emission: https://missionemission.co/

I am posting this here because air pollution is tightly connected to climate change and I thought that it would be a good idea to share it here.

Transportation is a major cause of air pollution and we focused on that with our project because it's an important part of everyone's life and people can relate. Our app allows you to choose a vehicle category, fuel, and route. It then shows you how much emissions you would generate on that journey, specifically CO2 (carbon dioxide) and NOx (nitrogen oxide). Those numbers are put in perspective with facts - for example, how much time is needed for a tree to absorb the amount of CO2 you would generate. Alternative routes with different transports are also displayed, as well as their emissions, allowing you to compare them to driving.

Our aim is to raise awareness or perhaps change people's minds on transportation and make them think about using a greener transport.

Hope you found that interesting!
Thank You!","2018-12-06 20:22:06","4","0","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/a3rv0h/online_emissions_calculator_that_aims_to_raise/","True","hdodov","1747906094.013254","CO2 is good","manual"
"aaab2d","climate","scientific","Idea: How insight in my own Carbon Footprint could lead to a better world","I recently had a discussion with family members during our Christmas dinner regarding global warming and how each of us as individual (whether we want it or not) contributes to the whole issue. What we concluded is that without insight into our own carbon footprints (as an estimator of environmental impact of the individual), it is hard for a willing individual to make (daily) responsible decisions that limit the extend to which these contribute to global warming.

&#x200B;

What would be the gains of such insight in your own carbon footprint:

By gaining insight into how my daily decisions (e.g. consumer behaviour when buying groceries, buying environmentally friendly clothing, ride my bike rather than drive my car) affect my carbon footprint, I think I'll become more aware and stimulated to gradually reduce my footprint over time. Additionally, I could see synergies between corporate & governmental institutions as this would open up incentives for promoting environmentally friendly behaviour (e.g. reduction in taxes, promoting the use of alternative transportation to the office).

&#x200B;

So here is my idea and (roughly) how it would work:

The idea is to create an product/service that gives the individual insight in his/her carbon footprint. This service would be based on an ever increasing database infrastructure, as the IoT gives us more and more data to draw conclusions from (maybe blockchain provides a solution for data reliability & validity here). The service/product would measure and calculate the carbon footprint based on various data sources (e.g. consumer behaviour deducted from payment data, fuel consumption from data generated by our cars etc.). By measuring the footprint, the individual would be presented with an overview, which could then be broken down for further analysis by the tools provided within the service (e.g. are there any specific products I buy, that significantly increase my footprint and should I consider alternatives?). After analysing the root causes (yes this is inspired by the continuous improvement philosophy) of your footprint, you would then be able to define ways on how to improve. Lastly the control step would be something that could integrate some sort of reward structure, to make sure individuals are rewarded adequately for good behaviour.

&#x200B;

What would be the business model:

I'd say we make this available for individuals for free, but charge (monthly/yearly) licensing costs for corporate & government institutions that are forced to invest in incentives that combat climate change. Also, by providing an option to analyse demographic information on carbon footprints these institutions could define targets for improvement (e.g. we want each individual in our workforce to have a maximum footprint of x kg of CO2 / year, or, we want to reduce the carbon footprint of our overall society by x% by 2025).

&#x200B;

So what's next:

As you might have concluded from the above, I have little to zero experience in software engineering, algorithms, cryptography and whatsoever. But what I do have is a background in industrial engineering & strategy. I hope that I have triggered some of you with this rough conceptual idea, and that we can get in touch someway, as I hope to further investigate if (co-)developing something like this is possible, or if any other parties are already working on similar initiatives.

I have heard great stories of open source development, and maybe this is something that can be developed together by using online team environment such as Slack.

Personally I think this concept could impact the world for the better, but that it will be challenging to develop. Nevertheless I hope that I have sparked some interest and I'm looking forward to get in touch with anyone who has ideas on how to further think this through.","2018-12-28 13:28:35","1","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/aaab2d/idea_how_insight_in_my_own_carbon_footprint_could/","True","HqHu","1747906095.1843364","CO2 is good","manual"
"aa2reh","sustainability","action-oriented","Starting a Sustainability/Climate Change Blog/YouTube Channel; Ideas for Topics?","I want to first say, I’m not trying to advertise myself and I won’t ever advertise the channel/blog here (but hey I won’t stop you from pming me if you REALLY want details haha) 
I’m still working on getting things up and running and would like more ideas for discussion topics. Also I’m new to the sub, so if this isn’t allowed, then feel free to just take the post down.

So with this channel/blog I want to talk about topics and ideas related to sustainability, climate change, the earth, and stuff along those lines, but I want to talk about things people haven’t really talked about yet, or don’t get talked about often. I also plan on testing sustainable alternatives to products. For example I already want to test food wax wrap compared to saran wrap to see how it holds up. Finally, it will generally include a little about me changing to live more sustainably with other helpful tips and tricks to stick with it. 

Here is kind of a starting list of topics I have so far. I’m a meteorologist and I’m finishing up my masters in sustainable water development, so a lot of my ideas come from professional experience, but I want more ideas from people who aren’t necessarily experts in climate and sustainability (see what the average person would like to know more about or would want to see talked about).

Ideas:
Food Miles vs Food Choice 
Should you really be showering everyday? (Health and Environment, how do we balance?) 
What if every family only had 2 children? 
Most common recycling mistakes 
Reusable cup for a week (Why you should bring your own cup to Starbucks) 
Why climate change is a feminist issue 
Why climate change is a civil rights issue
Why sea level rise is an issue of National Security (military bases threat)
Why sea level rise could cause the zombie apocalypse (coffins rising from flood waters)
Food wax wrap vs Saran Wrap 
Why we shouldn’t actually ban straws (overcoming challenges with disabilities and sustainability)
How to perform a Home Energy Audit 

Thank you for any help! I really appreciate it! :)
