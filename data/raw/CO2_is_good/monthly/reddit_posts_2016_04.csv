As ever dire studies continue to reaffirm worst case scenarios, it should be clear to anyone paying attention that in the next century the Earth will be unrecognizable from its current state. Basic planetary geography and atmospheric conditions will be altered through warming oceans and rising sea levels which are [now increasing faster than at any time in the past 2800 years](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517056113). On average, [sea levels were between 50 and 82 feet higher the last time CO2 levels were at 400ppm](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-3-2.html). CO2 levels are now increasing around 3ppm per year, [a twentyfold increase since pre-industrial times when the highest recorded increase was 0.15 ppm per year](https://theconversation.com/mass-extinctions-and-climate-change-why-the-speed-of-rising-greenhouse-gases-matters-56675). In our warming world, the hydrologic cycle is changing and [creating extreme weather](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/06/02/3664087/weather-whiplash/); crop-destroying droughts and floods are becoming more frequent. Rising winter temperatures are beginning to destroy the ""winter chill"" needed for many fruit and nut trees to properly blossom and produce maximally. Climate change is also [disrupting flower pollination](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/06/climate-change-is-disrupting-flower-pollination-research-shows). We've long since passed [the tipping point of melting Arctic summer sea ice](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/275/2013/tc-7-275-2013.pdf); 300-350 ppm of CO2 was the threshold for many parts of the climate. These changes are irreversible on a timescale of human civilizations. Even if all human industrial activity magically ceased today, the footprint man has already left will be felt for eons.

Homo sapiens have only been on the planet for the equivalent of a few seconds in geologic time but have managed to overwhelm and foul up all of earth's natural processes and interdependencies, leaving [a distinct layer in the sedimentary record](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/humans-leave-a-telltale-residue-on-earth1/). There is nothing modern humans do that is truly sustainable. Here are a few glaring examples: 

- [Techno-fixes are built into the IPCC's projections for maintaining a habitable planet for humans.](https://systemicdisorder.wordpress.com/tag/green-capitalism/) 

- Remember this headline from 2013?: [Arctic methane release could cost economy $60 trillion -study](http://www.reuters.com/article/arctic-methane-idUSL6N0FT1PU20130724). Our response was to go on a fracking binge which [increased our methane emissions by some 30%](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/u-s-methane-emissions-on-the-rise).

- While the resource intensity of GDP may be falling (less resources needed to produce 1$ worth of goods/services), the *absolute* decoupling of resource use, emissions, pollution, etc from GDP growth is the only thing that matters and [that is not happening](http://cleantechnica.com/2016/01/15/the-false-promise-of-decoupling-gdp-growth-from-resource-consumption/). 
If the world's population continues to grow as projected and current lifestyles do not change, [global resource consumption will increase anywhere from 2 to 5 times by 2050](https://books.google.com/books?id=sxDHBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=%22global+resource+consumption%22+%22by+2050&source=bl&ots=xwt_obWm7k&sig=nm1m5BJwXcOjZHT8C2o9Kt5wlGk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7-dHz0sXLAhVS3WMKHVR3CVQ4ChDoAQgdMAE#v=onepage&q=%22global%20resource%20consumption%22%20%22by%202050&f=false). It defies logic that a continually growing economy would be able to reduce its resource intensity down to near-zero to achieve a sustainable ecological footprint.

- According to [recent research](http://phys.org/news/2011-06-afforestation-dent-problem.html), even if we converted 100% of farmland to reforestation projects it would only lower temperatures 0.45C by the end of the century. Converting half of global farmland to reforestation would result in just a 0.25C drop. Other recent studies have come to the same conclusion:

>**""No amount of reafforestation or growing of new trees will ultimately off-set continuing CO2 emissions due to environmental constraints on plant growth and the large amounts of remaining fossil fuel reserves,"" Mackey says. ""Unfortunately there is no option but to cut fossil fuel emissions deeply as about a third of the CO2 stays in the atmosphere for 2 to 20 millennia.""** - [Link](http://bio-fuel-watch.blogspot.com/2013/12/biofuelwatch-reforestation-is-not.html)

Relying on machines for answers to the existential problems of a species run amok with planet-destroying tools and weaponry is rather ironic and tragic. We're locked-up inside a complexity trap of our own making. The human propensity for tool-building coupled with our discovery of fossil fuels has created a set of living arrangements in which we are now enslaved to those machines and tools. The globalized capitalist economy externalizes its destruction and atrocities, keeping the masses in a state of ignorance and denial. Despite the best efforts of scientists, environmentalists, and activists, the wealthy countries most able to do something won't ""get it"" until famine, disease, and war come to their country. And this is all being left for the 'free market' to sort out at the same time that climate change, a conflict multiplier, ramps up.

"4eg397","collapse","skeptical","Our society has its priorities completely backwards, we misunderstood what life is about","Does anyone else ever think about this? Let's accept as a given that fossil fuels are so valuable that we're inevitably going to burn all the fossil fuels we can burn, because they're tightly connected to economic growth. When we accept this line of thought, the priority becomes ensuring that the global economy grows as slowly as possible. After a while, [the melting of land ice leads to a drop in global temperatures](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/4e11ow/global_warming_could_cause_temporary_global/), as fresh water enters the oceans. In addition, carbon dioxide is slowly removed through weathering processes, as well as through vegetation growth. Similarly, the rise in sea levels would stabilize the methane clathrates in the ocean. The main problem we face right now is that emissions are so fast that they outpace all the various negative natural feedback processes.

If we accept this line of reasoning, we could then argue that the best thing that ever happened to humanity was the Arab oil embargo, which slowed down economic growth and led to a global drop in oil consumption. Similarly, the existence of communism is fantastic, as it hampers economic growth, ensuring that carbon dioxide is released more slowly. In addition, the collapse of communism is accompanied by a sudden temporary drop in carbon emissions. Also useful were world war I and II, as well as the great depression. CO2 emissions tend to go down during these periods.

To me it appears that as a society we completely have our priorities backwards when it comes to climate change. Instead of pursuing economic growth and increased efficiency, we should have pursued destruction and economically inefficient systems on a global scale. What we need are massive trade barriers between nations, that hamper economic growth. What we need are international embargo's, where nations that together have a monopoly on a resource refuse to sell the resource to other nations.

The economy can best be seen as a beast that has to be restrained at all cost. Even if we were unable to destroy industrial civilization on a global scale, simply triggering repeated contractions could have led to a better outcome than the outcome we will face today.

If there's something you can do to make the world better, it's this: Hurt the economy! It doesn't matter how you hurt the economy, as long as you hurt the economy. Vote for a politician who seems so radical or incompetent that he would crash the economy (that's why I support Trump). Vote against all free trade deals, which increase economic integration between different nations and thus economic growth. When you sit in your cubicle, do your job as poorly as possible. If you can make your company go bankrupt, you're a hero!

When we accept that the path of economic growth is the path of destruction, we begin to realize that we misunderstood what life is about. It is supposed to be a continual chronic war against progress. A man dedicated to destruction can cause more economic damage in his lifetime than a hundred men could fix. As an analogy, I want to leave you with an explanation of Tolkien's work. [In Tolkien's mythology, technology represents evil and materialism in contrast to the goodness of nature and spirituality.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordoftherings/comments/1aryha/can_someone_please_explain_why_technology_in_the/c908kzc) The reason Middle Earth never advances beyond the Iron age is because the creatures that inhabit it are simply not evil enough for the world to progress.

If we look at ourselves, who is truly evil? To me, evil is a man who does not genuinely love life. Someone who studies computer science because he wants to make a lot of money is evil, whereas someone who studies English because they like medieval poetry despite knowing this will render them permanently unemployable is good. When the economy fails to grow, it may be because of fossil fuel depletion, but we could also consider that it might happen simply because we are not evil enough for it to grow further, as Tolkien would assert.","2016-04-12 13:30:46","52","41","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/4eg397/our_society_has_its_priorities_completely/","True","knockknockitsmeagain","1747874591.4373646","CO2 is good","manual"
