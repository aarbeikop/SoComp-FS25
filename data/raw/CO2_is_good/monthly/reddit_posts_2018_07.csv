Like for example the transition between ice age and ...not ice age. Are there any conclusive evidence that what we are seeing now is not just the result of a natural climate change?","2018-07-30 18:59:09","1","6","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/936w9x/natural_climate_change/","True","Helverin","1747897953.5743902","CO2 is good","manual"
"9337bz","environment","emotional","I challenge you to reduce CO2 by compensating your emissions","78 tonnes of CO2 have been saved already from projects with Gold Standard certification, which is the site I use. Comparable to the total emissions of Australia. I compensate for myself and my small business every month.

**I challenge you to reduce CO2 by compensating your emissions.**  


**Sites where you can achieve this:**  
[goldstandard.org/get-involved/make-an-impact](https://goldstandard.org/get-involved/make-an-impact) ($12 per ton, certified through projects that also help in other ways)  
[carbonfootprint.com](https://carbonfootprint.com) ($8.17 per ton)  
(Feel free to add more in comments)

Here's some statistics of [averages tonnes CO2 emissions per year per person by country](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270508/co2-emissions-per-capita-by-country/) (2015):  
USA: 19.68  
Canada: 15.32  
UK: 5.99  
Netherlands: 9.21  
Germany: 8.93  
France: 4.37

I also suggest reading ""[A degree by degree explanation of what will happen when the earth warms](http://globalwarming.berrens.nl/globalwarming.htm)"":

There are many good initiatives that reduce your own emissions so if you can't afford above or want to do more try eating meat 1-2 days less per week, using public transportation to work, take the train instead of flying, etc. There are 414K subscribers, lets do something together!","2018-07-30 11:17:23","1","0","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/9337bz/i_challenge_you_to_reduce_co2_by_compensating/","True","FranzWienerschnitzel","1747898070.7624025","CO2 is good","manual"
"90qpd2","collapse","skeptical","760MM trees were planted in Pakistan. By my math, that reduces CO2 emissions by a whopping 0.05%","I saw a post in r/Futurology about the amazing ""Billion Tree Project"" in Pakistan, which got me to thinking: what impact does that many trees really have? Here's the hasty approximate math I did in a comment:

A young tree captures ~50lb of CO² a year (on the high end). That means all those trees capture about 16.5 million metric tons a year. Last year, we emitted just over 38 billion tons of CO².

Those 700 million trees only reduced our planetary emissions of carbon dioxide by about 0.05%.

Yes, planting trees is a good thing! But the perspective of how little an impact it makes in contrast to carbon-spewing coal plants is shocking.
