"5j9rkq","climate","scientific","On Climate Modelling - Questions","We know there is more CO2 in the atmosphere than there has been. And we know this is causing more infrared radiation to be retained in the planet's atmosphere than has been released. We know this because we have satellites measuring the upward radiation and ground equipment measuring the downward radiation over thirty years, and the spectrographs show the various chemicals in the atmosphere that are causing the change in radiation which is directly related to the chemical change ratios in the atmosphere.

So there is no substantive argument about that (other than recycling arguments that have been settled by science). We are retaining more infrared radiation due to CO2 emissions and if we reduce them or eliminate them we will retain less.

The fun starts when the simple facts about how atmosphere works are punched into a simplified computer model and extrapolated. Then you're into the realms of weather forecasting in a chaotic dynamic feedback system. And we know that rapidly diverges from reality. A three week weather forecast with any kind of accuracy is devilishly difficult to achieve as the probabilities diverge. I've still to see a good argument why climate predictions can be *any more accurate than that*.

"5gb9wg","environment","emotional","The Massive Climate Change March is happening. Let’s be 10 million strong, I'm not even kidding! It’s up to us. April 29th 2017 in D.C. by People'sClimate.org. Many big orgs coordinating. Link and info in comments.","WE NEED TO ORGANIZE UNDER ONE UMBRELLA TO SHOW REAL POWER.

Hi I’m an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march:

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? 
________

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let’s take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn’t happen. Game over.

_________

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they’re at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and … ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

__________
REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

______________
MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There’s a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

LOCAL MAYORS ARE PROVING AWESOME

Also, local moves. Mayors are powerful:

Check this action out by Europe, 10 major cities banning diesel for green: http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38170794

WE can do this in the USA. 35 of OUR BIG CITY MAYORS just wrote this letter:

Reply here to keep brainstorming. It feels good to at least be doing something.

And social media is how Trump won, we can wield it too. It's an insanely powerful force for any movement when the communication is solid.

**Prologue**
We are overpopulated, our planet is warming, our soil is being destroyed, our antibiotics are ineffective, the ecosystems we rely on are in turmoil. Humanity and civilization now face a life-or-death fight on many fronts. I believe we will endure a traumatic and extraordinary decline. But I also believe we also have extraordinary power to help ourselves, both individually and collectively.
As we learn more, the news can seem very scary. Some days inevitably, you will just want to panic, or cry, or give up, or deny it all.
Instead, I would like to tread the middle road of realism – and you can too. No matter how bleak the future, there are reasons to remain calm and fight for the future. Here are fifty that I thought of. Some are facts, others are feelings. I hope one or two might help you in your darkest moments. 

**1.Panicking doesn’t help.**
Panicking people don’t change anything, and they don’t enjoy themselves either. Don’t condemn yourself to that kind of life, when you can live it well, and still be part of the change.

**2. Earth will not explode.**
I know it’s ridiculous, but let’s start our perspective at the worst nightmare and work down.

I saw a cartoon of an exploding Earth once in an online column. It was probably a joke, but I want to tell you the ground is not going anywhere. Earth will stay a beautiful planet, oceans and all, for a billion years yet – and that’s a long time. Sometimes, thinking about that deep future brings me calm.

**3. Earth won’t turn into Venus.**
Sometimes speaking about climate change, one compares Earth to Venus. Venus is hotter than an oven, has no liquid water, and nothing can live there. But Venus has an atmosphere ninety times heavier than Earth’s, made of almost pure CO2. That’s 90,000 times more CO2 than even a greenhouse Earth. So trust me, if you didn’t know, we can’t turn Earth into Venus.

We also can’t reach the irreversible “moist greenhouse” state that has been posited as a similar end to life on Earth – not even if we burn all the fossil fuels.

**4. Earth has been here before.**
We know Earth has dozens of mass extinctions in its history, most associated with catastrophic sudden climate change. The worst we know of was the Permian-Triassic boundary – a ten-degree warming triggered by CO2, no less – that killed about ninety percent of all life. These events were terrible, but they were no-one’s fault.

Don’t think we are even the first life on Earth to change the climate. We’re not that exceptionally terrible. We just stumbled on something we shouldn’t have.

**5. Earth’s life will carry on.**
After every catastrophe, Earth’s life slowly recovered. Life, even complex life, is incredibly tenacious; it will hang on to the last. The Anthropocene extinction will decimate Earth’s rich biodiversity, but through speciation it will one day recover.
Sometimes I think about what Earth will look like in fifty million years. Regardless of human actions, I imagine a lush and beautiful wilderness full of plants and animals: a few you might recognize, and others strange and new. None of them will know or care what we did. In this important way, we will be forgiven. 

**6. Humans are of the Earth.**
We tend to think of ourselves as separate from nature, but we are animals, a part of the ecosystem. We’re related by blood to all other animals. Every species has in common a certain selfishness, a genetically-implanted desire to grow and consume. It’s not unique to us, and we can’t turn it off.
In the same competition as all our animal peers, we used an unusual resource to excel. It is who we are, and it is what it is. 

**7. We started in an ice age.**
Earth has been ice-free for 85% of its history. Starting with an ice-free Earth, we would have had far less room to emit CO2 before reaching a very hostile climate. So, given that we were destined to discover a billion years’ worth of fossil fuels and start lighting them up, we evolved at a (relatively) suitable time to do it. Let’s be thankful for small mercies. 

**8. The worst climate terror is far away.**
The most nightmarish scenario of all is “oceanic eunixia”, in which bacteria in the oceans release hydrogen sulphide gas which poisons life on land and sea, It has contributed to mass extinctions before. But we will never see it, and our descendants probably won’t either. Eunixia has only ever happened when CO2 levels were consistently above 1000 parts per million, which we’re not projected to manage. Even then it is far from certain, and if it happens it may not be worldwide, and in any case it wouldn’t start for ten thousand years. Don’t waste your nightmares on such distant possibilities – focus on more proximate concerns. 

**9. Some humans will probably carry on.**
In any event except severe eunixia (or a large meteor), I believe humans will persist after our civilization collapses. Before civilization we were already one of the most widespread animals on Earth. Our ingenuity, adaptability and ability to eat just about anything leads us to adapt to every climate, hot and cold. We’ve even endured sharp changes of climate before. The ecosystems we destabilized will reel and transform for millennia to come, but if we cover everywhere still inhabitable, is it silly to suggest a hardy few will make it through the turmoil? 

**10. We might have prolonged Earth’s life.**
A little ""bad science"" argument: geological weathering processes and fallen plants have progressively sequestered the world’s carbon – the latter is why we have fossil fuels in the first place, of course. Millions of years from now, this caching process will eventually annihilate CO2, prevent photosynthesis, and possibly cause the end of much life. If we have delayed this process, think of all the extra generations of future plant and animal life we might have permitted – an ironic blessing to tomorrow’s life, to partner the curse we bestow on today’s. 

**11. Our animal companions will accompany us.**
After humans, the more likely mammals to survive include the ones we have partnered with. Our symbiotic friendships with dogs, cats and horses has lasted millennia, and you find them just about everywhere you find you find humans. Any surviving humans will probably continue to benefit from the service and companionship of these animals. Consider some distant descendants of ours, confronting a challenging world with the aid of a faithful working dog. 

**12. You won’t live through it all.**
The full equilibration of Earth’s climate to its new warm state will take hundreds of years, and so – God willing – will humanity’s fight to survive it. So as you hear about all the terrible predictions of what will or might happen, understand that you won’t have to see them all. 

**13. We know what’s happening.**
Our knowledge of the world, while sadly incomplete, is colossal. We know about our own climate forcing and nature’s many feedback loops. Our predictions of the crisis’ progression improve every day even as we enter it. The knowledge that terrifies you, also terrifies the powerful who must act to mitigate it. Knowledge is the force for good against ignorant capitalism.
Imagine the contrary: had we remained in ignorance, and rapidly burned all the world’s fossil fuel reserves without a clue of what we were doing, we would have had nothing to do but weep and blame an angry God. 

**14. We are doing much about it.**
Our eleventh-hour fight against our CO2 emissions, while predictably late, is still massive and commendable. Science has laid bare the consequences, and politicians have finally listened. You may find the policy changes meagre, but they matter and they will grow. Also, we can’t deny that we’ve had a pulse of innovation including efficient and cheap renewable energy, power reduction of appliances, electric cars, “sustainable” building materials, and so on. It’s not enough to stop the warming, but it’s not bad. 

**15. Engineers can optimize for anything.**
Engineers have always optimized their creations – for minimum weight on a plane, or minimum cost on a mass-produced object. Now for some time they have also been optimizing for reduced embodied CO2 in materials and processes, and the savings matter. Don’t believe the exaggerated greenwash, but know that we tried. 

**16. What we have built can help us.**
As we face civilizational decline and fight to kill emissions, the infrastructure we have built will make it easier. It’s hardly utopian, but for example, if we can maintain the internet for some time, we might communicate during the decline (say, about which plants will grow) without spending invaluable emissions on travel, which will save lives or make them more bearable.
 
**17. Renewable energy is reality.**
A huge renewable energy capacity is now being created worldwide. Some, like solar panels, are localized. It is some comfort to me that even survivors of an acute crisis may, at least initially, have some sources of useful energy other than the deadly fossil fuels. 
 
**18. There are (limited) means for us to sequester carbon.**
If the crisis spins us into enough panic to act, there may be a little artificial mediation of the effects – like harvesting biomass and sequestering its carbon. It’s no solution, but it allows some faint hope of us undoing some of the catastrophe before its full effects arrive. This is slowly becoming technologically and politically viable, so if you have any faith in technology, you might like to place some here. 

**19. Technology is a good unknown.**
In general, technology created our problems and it won’t solve them, but one can still hope that some late-stage innovations reduce the final total, or rate, of CO2 released. For example, the explosive growth of renewable energy has exceeded all expectations, and will allow us to shut off fossil fuel plants a little earlier, if we are willing. The remarkable pace of innovation will have at least some effect on the shape and size of our carbon pulse – I do hope it is to the good. 

**20. You’re probably in the global elite.**
Ordinary citizens can’t much affect the path of our leadership in this crisis, but you can try to navigate your own way through it all. If you are a middle-class professional in a rich country like the US or Europe, you are probably in the global 1%, so however badly your own life will be affected this century, I guarantee you, other poor souls will have it worse. In dark times, be grateful for your advantages. 

**21. Social change can be rapid.**
I am often depressed by the lack of public awareness and agitation against climate change in the US and UK –rendered docile by cynical leaders and manipulative media, many of us seem to have accepted the offer to plug our ears and walk into the fire. But in most other countries the public care, and attitude can swing here too when we get a big enough scare. We will all care about this, very soon. 

**22. There are reasons for nations to work together.**
We have reached this lamentable place, with so much warming already and so much more unavoidably to come, because nations could not overcome their differences and avert the tragedy of the commons. Now though, this seems to be changing – because every nation has everything to lose. Any leader who loves their own land more than they hate others, now concludes that even at a national level, the best path is to urgently cut emissions. 

**23. There are economic reasons to reduce emissions.**
In a capitalist system, a low-carbon economy emerges when low-carbon technologies are cheaper than the alternatives. This is now true for energy sources, and that market force is stronger than political hand-wringing. Market foresight means investment money will flow to energy and transport solutions that are reducing in price, and will be cheaper in the future. The more we deconstruct the carbon economy, the greater the incentives will be.

**24. It is worth changing your lifestyle.**
Become more sustainable in your food, energy and transport consumption. Your individual contribution may be negligible – every big helps – but it will prepare you for a future when we have no choice, and set a valuable example to others.

**25. This fight will bring us purpose.**
In the developed world we have few material complaints, but often feel that our lives lack meaning. There is a reason for this: we are programmed to relish struggle. Fighting for humanity’s survival is the greatest struggle of all. Make it your cause.
Believe it or not, we do have a future. You have a future. 

**26. Hardship brings us together.**
We may be headed for hard times, and that brings enemies – we may be pitted against each other, and we will certainly be less safe. But we will also form strong alliances and communities, out of necessity if nothing else. These alliances will be of a depth you’ve never known before. We will band together, and in our groups, we will help each other. 

**27. There will be helpers.**
Terrible tragedies will happen this century, on a scale we have never seen before – but as Mr Rogers once said, in ever tragedy, look for the helpers. Look for those kind souls who try to respond and make things better, even if for a moment. They are humanity’s best face, and they are always there in the background.
Better yet, when the opportunity comes, be one. 

**28. We can learn from the old.**
Talk to the old, who have experienced war, and didn’t grow up in our period of privilege and safety. They have many lessons for you about how to survive and stay sane under impossible circumstances. 

**29. We grew in ignorance, but we will decline with wisdom.**
We may face, as least for now, a seemingly interminable backward march along the road of history. But there is one difference. The knowledge we have built in this era is like the great library of Alexandria, a million times over. Yes, some of it will burn and be forgotten, but some of it will help us in our fight to survive.  

**30. We will break our addiction to progress.**
The Idea of Progress is an 18th Century European invention – broadly, that technology improves the human condition. Two staggering world wars using technology did not free us from the ridiculous mentality that we can master the Earth with progress. But in the coming decline, dealing with catastrophic climate change of our own making, that day must finally arrive – all the better for our survival. 

**31. We will set an example for the next generations.**
We will teach them about the inevitability of decline and adaptation, and about the need for efficiency, frugality, and good use of those little resources that remain. We’re the first generation for a while to really know about this, but our philosophical shift may set the moral tone for a long time to come. 

**32. You aren’t “stealing” our children’s resources.**
You didn’t choose to live at this strange and decadent time, at the peak of such an unsustainable and destructive globalized society. You were born into it, just as your ancestors were born into your era, and your children are born into theirs. Just live lightly and prepare them for a depleted and chaotic future – this is the best thing you can do for them.  

**33. This crisis was always going to happen.**
From the moment we found coal, we were destined to meet climate change. Its potential has always been there, waiting to be unleashed. If not fossil fuels, agricultural emissions alone might have done it. And, resources consumed being related to population, our climate crisis was destined to coincide with a (similarly inevitable) crisis of overpopulation.

You have been chosen by fate to witness the long-anticipated moment that humans confront this great double-headed beast. We will respond as well as we can.

**34. Some collapse is desirable.**
Our culture is decadent, corrupt, and revels in an illusion of abundance. It’s not healthy, and in the end it hasn’t even made us that happy.
My distant hope is that one day, on a strange and warmer world, some people will get a chance to build again and live well for a while – but with the memory of our past follies seared into their flesh and culture, so that they hesitate to repeat them, for a while at least. That vision may seem unimaginably out of reach, but one may cling to it nevertheless – you never know how people find a way. 

**35. Collapse panic is not realism.**
By all means prepare yourself for a societal collapse, but don’t assume the worst will happen – this mentality is not logical, and it leads to dangerous conclusions and self-destructive actions. The hard road of realism means agitating for the best option, preparing for the worst, and above all, responding to changes as they come, to keep yourself alive and in the game. 

**36. Unsustainable lifestyles must stop anyway.**
“Unsustainable” means it was never going to be sustained. It’s that simple. The end of unsustainable life is not pleasant, but it is right. I think the waste of our age is barbaric, and globalization has ultimately failed us.

(On the other hand, our global interdependence, the one thing standing between us and a complete tragedy of the commons scenario, is still here for now and very difficult to undo.)

**37. We’ll understand things again.**
I am rather sick of living in a world of incomprehensible man-made complexity – technological, political, economic. One thing is for sure – if we are forced into a simpler world, it will have its dangers, but it will be one that doesn’t vex our minds in this way. We will understand a little more of the processes that shape our lives. 

**38. Our happiness adjusts to our circumstances.**
As a pampered First World citizen, the transition to decline can seem unimaginably tragic and frightening – if it’s not literally the end of the world, the end of our lifestyles may as well be. But think: our ancestors’ lives were much simpler, humbler and more precarious, sometimes violent, and yet they did find moments of joy in them. Under all but the most hopeless and painful circumstances, humans prefer to be alive. Remember: the end of growth does not mean the end of all human happiness. Find those moment of joy in your own life, and treasure them. 

**39. Expectations adjust to our means.**
We drive our cars to work, even though we know it slowly destroys the atmosphere. We do so because we are expected to: by the boss, by the government, by our peers. In this simple way, the continued destruction of nature has been ratcheted up, even by citizens who don’t really want to. Our means are so great in this golden age, but society has expectations of us to match. In decline, both will be cut away together – you’re only expected to do what you can. 

**40. Scientists need to scare people.**
When climate scientists reveal scary findings, they must frame them in a scary way. It’s the right thing for them to do. They themselves are scared, and they want important people to listen.
The target audience for this fear-mongering is more them than you (although public awareness is the key to convincing them). Once again, always remember it’s not up to you to solve the world’s insoluble problems – you’ve only got to endure them. This lesser task is difficult enough. Don’t take on burdens that aren’t yours. Let world events take their course, and respond. 

**41. Politicians are what they are.**
Instead of despairing at the inaction of politicians, accept them for what they are: corrupt, arrogant and sefish. They care about your welfare only inasmuch as it keeps them in power. You’re clever enough to know that.

But know that sometimes your future prospects coincide with theirs, and this grave global challenge might just be one of those times.

**42. The media want you to panic.**
The media has always known that the best way to control behaviour is by appeal to emotions, and the strongest of all is fear. Fearful readers are more susceptible to the distractions the media provides, namely bovine consumption and ignorance. So the media write all their articles in a sensationalist way, no matter which political stripe. Be aware of the facts, but don’t binge on media – you only hurt yourself. You don’t have to go along with their game. 

**43. You are strong.**
You are strong enough to live in the “desert of the real”, to understand the terrible troubles of the world and face them bravely, while focusing on your own life and negotiating through them. You are a survivor. You are prepared. You are strong. 

**44. Everything has an upside.**
As awful as it sounds… some of the impossible crises we face can mitigate the others. A trade war, as awful as it would be, would greatly reduce trade volumes and hence global CO2 emissions, buying the human race valuable time to migrate and adapt to new climates. A pandemic, as awful as that would be, would reduce overpopulation. It’s the grimmest argument I’ve ever thought of for optimism, but there it is. 

**45. Merriment is a renewable resource.**
In the darkest, toughest times, force a smile. Force yourself to dance and sing, create a little merriment with your loved ones and friends. It’s free, emits no carbon, and keeps our hopes alive for one more day. 

**46. Life is too long anyway.**
I won’t sugarcoat it: Collapse, or end-stage decline, means our lives will be shorter. Diseases will return to haunt us, violence will be more common, nourishment will be uncertain, there may be little if any medicine.
But on the other hand, our lives now in the West are blighted in any case by the great pain of old age. People are kept alive to the point where they hardly enjoy it any more. 

**47. Everyone dies one day.**
In your life, the worst that can happen to you is that you suffer and die. As our population must eventually decrease, this is indeed certain to happen to many people. But you can’t avoid death anyway! Everyone dies. The only thing you have to lose is comfort. Smile at the absurdity of life, and continue on your way. 

**48. Success and doom are not the only two options.**
Between the unlikely best-case scenario (green tech miracles and population stabilization in the West lead to a period of sustainable comfort) and the unlikely worst case scenario (rapid collapse, war, famine) there are many hypothetical outcomes. I’m sure you’ve considered them all. Maybe collapse will be followed by some rebuilding, or maybe we will have a long but stable decline under austere, authoritarian but stable rule. In most scenarios, you get to live some kind of life.
Our history isn’t written yet. Don’t waste your life-energy writing it. 

**49. No single action will doom or save us.**
No single event – election, natural disaster, climate change discovery for better or worse, whatever – will act alone in determining our fate. It is shaped by longer trends. So don’t panic at each day’s news, even if it’s very bad. Larger, longer trends are what matters. 
And once again remember, there are 7 billion individual stories to be written, they’re not all the same, and yours is unlikely to be the worst. 

**50. We’re all in this together.**
Don’t face this alone. Everyone on Earth must face this awful future, and it’s on all of our minds. Share your pain with your loved ones, and share love and comfort each other. Be happy, whenever you can.  

---

**Epilogue**
The message of this post is not simply “stop thinking about climate change and overpopulation”. That would be silly: The rest of our lives will be dominated by this, it will touch everyone, some severely, some will die. It’s not your fault that you’re in this, but you can learn to accept it. Meld your fear with hope to make determination, resilience and resolve. Both individually and collectively, the more we think, act and prepare, the better we’ll do.

I’m ready. Let’s go.
