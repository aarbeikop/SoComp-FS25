This isn’t add on equipment to capture the co2 afterwards, its a fundamental part of how it is designed to operate. The liquid co2 can be injected into the ground for the purpose of new fossil fuel extraction. If they can work out how to scale their pilot plant, this could be a game changer.

If vegan abolitionism becomes dominant then we would begin to see real change in terms of bringing about an snd to aninal exploitation, a consequence of which will see ecological and environmental benefits.

"dutk2jk","t3_806yx9","806yx9","collapse","skeptical","> methane hydrates

[just a little info on the 'methane hydrates problem':](http://envisionation.co.uk/index.php/nick-breeze/203-subsea-permafrost-on-east-siberian-arctic-shelf-now-in-accelerated-decline):

> Dr. Shakhova: The importance of hydrates involvement in methane emissions is overestimated. The hydrate is just one form of possible reservoirs, in which pre-formed methane could be preserved in the seabed if there are proper pressure/temperature conditions; **it is just the layer of hydrates composes just few hundred of meters – this is a very small fraction compared to thousands of meters of underlying gas-charged sediments in the ESAS**. 

> Dr. Semiletov added that the 5 billion tonnes of methane that is currently in the Earth’s atmosphere represents about one percent of the frozen methane hydrate store in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. He finishes emphasising  “…but we believe the hydrate pool is only a tiny fraction of the total.” 

> The second point is that the hydrates are not all of the gaseous pool that is preserved in this huge reservoir. This huge area is 2 million square kilometres. The depth of this sedimentary drape is a few kilometres, up to 20 kilometres at places. Generally speaking, it makes no difference if gas releases from decaying hydrates or from other free-gas deposits, because in the latter, gas also has accumulated for a long time without changing the volume of the reservoir; for that reason, gas became over pressurised too.

> **Unlike hydrates, this gas is preserved free; it is a pre-formed gas, ready to go. Over pressured, accumulated, looking for the pathway to go upwards.**

it's really just a methane problem, where the permafrost acts as a cap on gas release, which wasn't supposed to melt for a thousand years, but has already degraded to the point where 10% of the eastern siberian arctic shelf has become a 'hotspot' releasing methane 1000-100,000x the rate of background release ... and that's just the ESAS ...
