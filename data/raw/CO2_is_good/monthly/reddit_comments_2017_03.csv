Third: You can not argue with a denier, because they do not follow the scientific method - so they are not bound to reason, or an honest appraisal of scientific findings. They do sometimes *sound* sciency, though.

I'm a first year graduate student in meteorology, therefore I am a TA and have the pleasure of grading for the intro level classes. One of the professors doesn't believe in anthropogenic climate change, and though he 'tries' to teach in a manner that hides his bias, it definitely shines through in the final papers the students write. When I'm grading, how can I effectively portray to students that it is indeed a real and serious thing? In the same vein (yet a different class), the professor is going to start talking about climate change. These kids are freshmen and have a very elementary understanding of weather and climate. What's an effective way to teach them and to get them to think critically about the subject? 

Next week my school is putting on a student showcase so that we can present our research. Within this there is going to be a round table discussion about climate change and how we as scientists communicate it. Here are a few of the sample questions that we will be discussing : 
-Do we need to change the way scientists are educated (e.g., broaden, add more ""soft skills"" or social science)? 
-To what extent do scientists need to be involved in decision making?
-How much responsibility do scientists (as opposed to journalists or school teachers) hold for increasing public understanding of scientific/environmental issues?

As a global warming skeptic, please explain how carbon dioxide can be responsible for planet wide increase in the greenhouse effect (warming) when CO2 is only a fraction (<1%) of the greenhouse effect. 

I don't think anyone denies the fact that CO2 levels are rising, I just completely doubt the idea that this one tiny greenhouse gas could actually affect the weather on this planet. I think a more reasonable explanation is increased solar activity is increasing the amount of water vapor (THE LARGEST GREENHOUSE GAS) in the atmosphere which in turn is warming the planet. 

Do global warming extremist ever feel bad that CO2 is plant food, and by trying to reduce CO2 they are actually reducing plant life on the planet? I believe plant life was at its greatest when volcanic activity on the planet was higher and spewing tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, which provided for the huge plant life which created more oxygen as a byproduct, allowing for larger animal life. 

I will admit though, that even as a skeptic, the amount of filthy pollution in the air in places like China IS a problem, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's warming the planet. I swear humans are so egotistical to think we actually have the power to affect the WEATHER on this planet. Weather is simply the transfer of heat received by the SUN.

In the article you published, can you please comment on why specifically these analogies were chosen to be tested? Are they normally used to explain climate change to people?
Do you have any indications or assumptions as to why the medical analogy works better than the other two?
Can the ""climate sceptics"" introduce bias by presenting the analogies weaker in influence, not because they are not clear, but because they come with their own prejudice?

As far as I can see this study concentrated more on analogies convincing people that action is needed in spite of lack of absolute certainty in prediction of climate change consequences. Are there studies oriented on the use of analogies in explanation of the process and mechanisms of climate change, and specifically in dispelling the misinformation and falsehood about climate and human influence on climate change?
