"ebhbhvq","t3_a4snzx","a4snzx","climatechange","action-oriented","Yea, all most skeptics want to do at this point is inject uncertainty into the science. The people that make the arguments you cite I think can easily be discussed and shown to be wrong. Although you almost never will convince the person you are talking to, but maybe if there are others listening/reading the conversation you can change minds.

I would recommend potholer54's videos on climate change: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KLGqDSAjo&list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP

He is a science reporter and has a great perspective on how you should approach these conversations. His videos are also very interesting and informative.

The more interesting arguments against main-stream climate science come from people who describe themselves as 'lukewarmers'. Meaning they believe that manmade CO2 is causing the globe to warm but will not warm as much as mainstream science believes. There are actual climate scientists in this group. Judith Curry is one of the leading lukewarmers. She has a blog you can find, but some of it will be difficult to follow if you are not well versed in the science. And ultimately there is probably a good reason why peoples work who are on the fringe of science aren't well-accepted in the mainstream.

Edit:

I just want to add something I'm reminded of since I'm having this discussion with someone else. Which is to remember that there is a good reason why you believe in man made climate change even if you don't understand the science well and don't have a comeback to a skeptics scientific arguments. As laymen, we all believe lots of scientific theories that we don't know nearly well enough to actually defend based solely on the science. For instance I believe in evolution but I'm sure that if I was in a debate with a creationist 'scientist' I would be destroyed. Because although I know about the science generally, I don't know about the specifics of RNA and the fossil record etc.. I would be destroyed in that debate and I would come out of it still believing in evolution just the same, because my belief in it was never based on the science. My belief in evolution comes from my knowledge of the scientific method and the ~150 years of research that has created an extremely strong scientific consensus. So my belief isn't scientific, but it is evidence based. These are values that we all already hold and have held strongly since the Enlightenment. We just don't think about it very often, and so when a skeptic comes at you with a scientific argument and says that you need to change your view based on new evidence you might feel like this is true. But you already have good reason for your belief.

Of course I think it's important to learn and to discuss the science, but I also think it's very important to remember this as well. With every skeptic conversation I have I try to work this in. Most skeptics believe that they can defend their position in a purely logic, science based way but have never had their views actually questioned rigorously. Showing them how they actually don't know it as well as they thought is good but ultimately the reason their view is unwise is not science-based.","2018-12-10 05:38:36","7","[deleted]","1747905884.70468","CO2 is good","manual"
"ebhbn0k","t3_a4snzx","a4snzx","climatechange","action-oriented","First: There are a hundred different types of positions held by skeptics for a hundred different reasons, from ""*it's not happening*"" to ""*it's happening, but it's not us*"" to ""*it's happening, it's us, but it's good*"". Sometimes a single skeptic holds those positions simultaneously simply to win an argument (or at least not lose). In those cases, best to just move on.

More generally: My experience is that skepticism is tied up not with a reasoned scientific understanding, but with a person's world view (political or religious). If that's the case it's no good arguing based on facts, because they'll dispute the foundations of those facts. You should therefore get to know their world view and work towards finding some common ground there.

For example, if they are skeptical that government interventions can be beneficial, or that markets and business should be given free reign, then they probably won't be receptive to an argument about protecting the environment, or to for acting for the common good. They \*may\* be more receptive to discussing risk management to protect the economy, but it'll be tough going. If instead they are skeptical because of religious reasons, then maybe a common good argument might go further.

Enter into a discussion, stay on one topic at a time, and keep your cool. If you get frustrated you'll lose.","2018-12-10 05:41:37","6","dirk_prefect","1747905884.7084205","CO2 is good","manual"

Historical times have seen the Roman Warming Period which gave way to the Dark Age Cooling which in turn gave way to the MWP. The LIA ended ~1850 so temperatures have had to rise regardless of human activity. 

Since the end of the LIA the human population has increased from 1B to 7B, and it's doubled since 1950;  the onset of the ""rapid warming"". And, temperature has increased a mere 0.8C despite that huge increase in population, every one of whom generates heat. 

Alarmists love to say that the warming of today can't be compared to past warming because ""the rate of the present warming is unprecedented*. Which is, of course, balderdash. Thermometers were not invented until the 1700s and we have had a global temperature recording system system only since the 1960s. There is no hard data from past warming periods so there is no way to make the statement that the current warming is in any way unusual. Someone may object and point to paleo-data. But, paleo-data is inferred and is not a hard data record. 

Today's natural warming is occurring at a time when modern technology is producing more heat per person, for a much greater population, than ever in history.

Becoming a politician ? You need guile, duplicity the ability to be a bald faced liar and sociopath.  If you think you have these traits, then go for it. That's NOT a reflection on politicans, that's just what you need to succeed politically, that is however a reflection on VOTERS.

My suggestion ? enrol to vote, encourage your friends to enrol, encourage them to Vote Green and live a low consumption, low emissions life.  That is after all what you need to transition to to make this work.  It's not just bullshit like solar panels on roofs, no plastic bags and banning straws.

All of that said, you will complety ignore what I said and 'go for it anyway'.  Politicians are part of the problem, not part of the answer.  They are their to protect the property rights of the well to do.

You are right. The economic models are ridiculous - but are totally different from the climate models, which appear to be reliable. 

It doesn't seem to make sense to try and produce a conventional economic model for a world rocked by sea level rise, famine, drought and war. I can't imagine how you would even begin.

I believe that was for 8C of warming, right? At 4C you see the end of civilization, and at 6C you have alligators splashing around in tropical rainforests around the poles. So the idea that there'd be even be an economy at 8C is absurd.

It ignores the fact that the rest of the world will experience deeper and more destabilizing impacts, in poorer places, which will have huge repercussions for the US and all developed countries. Think Syria, times twenty.

Last month's horrifying IPCC report is a better guide, and even that understates the problem. Remember that the IPCC has consistently understated climate damage for three decades in one Assessment Report after another. They don't take many feedbacks into account, and their reports have to pass muster with oil countries before publication.

The truth is that climate change is not only a big deal, it is close to becoming the only deal that matters.","2018-12-03 05:09:09","2","Splenda","1747906052.1879077","CO2 is good","manual"
"eazwp5d","t3_a2ds9d","a2ds9d","climate","scientific","What I'm worried about and what most scientists are worried about is that from studying the earth past, we know that things have changed a lot and there were times when things were very cold (snowball earth) and times were it was very hot (hothouse). By studying the content of CO2 in the atmosphere we can deduce that those extreme changes were caused by comparatively small changes in the atmosphere. So why do small changes actually have big consequences? 

Well the reason is easy to understand it's called a feedback effect. When it starts to get cold on earth, there's more ice forming at the poles, therefore more radiation is being reflected to space, and the earth is cooling more and more over millenias, ending with a snowball earth. When there is a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere, it gets slightly hotter at first, but if there's enough heat it starts melting more ice, causing extra heat which causes more evaporation, causing more water vapor in the atmosphere, which melts even more ice, until the earth stabilizes in a 'hothouse' state where there's no ice and most of earth is in tropical climate.

There is no reason to believe that those events are somewhat unique to the past, and the physics behind those events are easy to understand. So if we put enough CO2 in the atmosphere, we will trigger a reaction that ends with a hothouse earth. It will happen more abruptly than in the past because the rate of emissions we are emitting is 10 times higher than natural causes in the past.

It is unlikely most ecosystems will be able to cope with those changes, triggering a mass extinction that might also make the earth lose it's ability to produce oxygen. Because of the rate of change. 

Finally, we are still talking about a couple of centuries to a millenia of abrupt climate change, so just looking at the end of the century will not give an accurate picture of the extent of things to come. On our deathbeds, we might all think 'climate change wasn't that bad after all' but a hundred generations down the line it is possible humanity will go extinct or live in a very hostile environment due to our carelessness.

"ecotfjz","t3_aa2reh","aa2reh","sustainability","action-oriented","I think to start with the basics like increased CO2 in the air causes more heat to be trapped and raises temps is great.  My personal opinion is because there is so much people hear in the media this key point often gets lost.  Having a grounded start of what's the problem and here's the implied path to a solution probably goes without saying, but it seems to not get said a lot.","2018-12-27 22:40:47","3","EndCarbonPollution","1747906650.1244767","CO2 is good","manual"
"ecp468w","t3_aa2reh","aa2reh","sustainability","action-oriented","Great stuff man. One thing I would like to add is to stress on ecological footprint in your blog or channel and try to quantify all measures through that instead of carbon footprint. Ecological footprint is more contextual and comprehensive. And there is a online calculator by global footprint network. I am trying that approach for our non profit work in Edmonton.","2018-12-28 01:15:03","3","zenneutral","1747906650.1270208","CO2 is good","manual"

"ecqy62y","t3_aa2reh","aa2reh","sustainability","action-oriented","I work as a consulting CMO for Geoplast, company dedicated to improving sustainability in the construction industry.

tructural sustainability is an often neglected issue. 

For example:
https://www.geoplastglobal.com/en/insights/how-airplast-made-edf-lab-paris-saclay-more-sustainable/

Concrete increases CO2 not only by production but transport. There are many products that reduce its use and it can be recycled. So when buying a house it would be good to ask for more sustainable structural engineering.

Feel free to email me for more at nikola@bemapps.com. Also send me your blog when on.
