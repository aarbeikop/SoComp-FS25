"e5h9a3q","t3_9d8ic2","9d8ic2","climate","scientific","> Stinnett argues (rather persuasively, imho) that the reason climate change didn't end up in the last debates is because of the anemic turnout among environmentalists.

I think this is somewhat fails to take into account the political and economic reality. I think you'll also need really disruptive mass protest that make an ordered state of affairs impossible and lowers the GDP over time. Protests and action like for the Arab spring or in Brazil.","2018-09-06 04:58:02","1","SurplusOfOpinions","1747903476.0969305","CO2 is good","manual"
"e65vmdt","t3_9gom3y","9gom3y","environment","emotional","Probably best to split it into meat at vegetables, at the least, and consider the amount of calories per serving of said meat or vegetable. Then compare that to the amount of energy (converted to calories) needed to raise a cow or produce an acre of corn. At least that could provide a methodology to get a ""food conversion"" efficiency. 

Then you need to figure out where your food is coming from to begin to estimate how much energy is consumed with its transportation. There is some amount of energy consumed with packaging, preparation, and cooking of the food (not sure how to estimate this, but would guess it would fit into a 15% adder at the end).

Finally, what happens to the food after preparation needs to be considered, how much of the food is eaten, thrown away, or composted. There may be some studies estimating carbon footprint associated with throwing food away. Composting captures carbon for the most part. Then finally the carbon footprint of the sewage from the school needs to be considered. 

Good luck and realize it's by far the largest number in your study. ","2018-09-17 23:34:15","1","lirternop","1747903615.0485663","CO2 is good","manual"
