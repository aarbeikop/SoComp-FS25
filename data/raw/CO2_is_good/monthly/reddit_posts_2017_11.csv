"7eed7h","climatechange","action-oriented","Thanksgiving coming up...My dad is a Human-caused Climate change skeptic. Book reccomendations to help change his mind?","He thinks the earth is getting warmer, but A) doesn't think it's our fault and B) doesn't necessarily think it's so bad. He is a relatively reasonable guy, but pretty conservative. However, he loves to read, and said that if I could give him a book to read on the subject, he would read it with an open mind.

My ask: Any recommendations on good books that might sway him? I've looked around and had a tough time finding any good suggestions. The more objective the author/source, the better obviously, so no  preachy/highly political books please. It will just turn him off. Also, the less it reads like a scientific journal the better. If it's available on Amazon prime, even better!

Thank you!","2017-11-21 02:17:44","6","11","0.72","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/7eed7h/thanksgiving_coming_upmy_dad_is_a_humancaused/","True","Jdubshack","1747891131.6793773","CO2 is good","manual"
