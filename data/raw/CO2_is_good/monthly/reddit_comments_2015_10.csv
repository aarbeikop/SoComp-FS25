"cwhcvpi","t3_3qq6av","3qq6av","climate","scientific","Hi there. CO2 is required for photosynthesis, which is how plants get energy. So one might think more CO2 means more photosynthesis, and enhanced plant growth! Indeed, that's sometimes the case.

However, plants also need sunlight, water and nutrients. In many parts of the world plant growth is 'water-limited' - that is, no matter what the CO2 level is, there isn't enough water to further enhance plant growth. 

In some parts of the world, plant growth is indeed CO2-limited, and increased CO2 concentrations will probably enhance plant growth in those areas. An interesting side-effect of this is that, when plant growth is enhanced by CO2 and not water limited, the use of water by plants will increase. As a consequence, plants will remove water from the soil and decrease the flow in some rivers. This has recently been [demonstrated](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2831.html) for Australian river basins.","2015-10-29 17:23:49","5","nimbuscile","1747868594.4529543","CO2 is good","manual"
"cwhpzrg","t3_3qq6av","3qq6av","climate","scientific","In addition to the other comments,  I would like to add that CO2 absorption by plants is also dependant in nitrogen content in the soil.  If the nitrogen content is low,  the plants will not absorb much CO2,  so only plants in wet,  high nitrogen content soil benefit from increased CO2.

"cwi346k","t3_3qq6av","3qq6av","climate","scientific","CO2 does benefit plants. Some drought-tolerant herbaceous crops, like wheat, perform markedly better as CO2 increases; woody plants, such as trees, not so much. However, sooner or later, *global warming* overwhelms these benefits with drought stress, fire, fungus, pollination cycle disruption, more diseases and insects, etc.. That's why the scientific consensus predicts 20% impacts to crop yields in a few decades. Remember the 2010 Russian heat wave? It destroyed crops across the country, even wheat, forcing the government to ban grain exports (which sparked the Arab Spring revolutions...but that's another story).","2015-10-30 05:20:59","1","Splenda","1747868594.4579544","CO2 is good","manual"

2. Moving out of fossil fuels is indeed going to require fossil fuels.  Hence the need to get started early. But the fossil fuels required to produce solar and wind are much lower than say building a nuclear plant.

3. No. Basic finance. Why would you spend the upfront cost to cannibalize the exorbitant current profits from your existing operations? There's no business case to be made in a capitalistic model unless regulation or expected regulation will slash future profit. They have and will continue to fight it. The solar industry is extremely competitive... plenty of companies are taking advantage of the opportunity. ","2015-10-15 13:20:26","1","[deleted]","1747868713.2093823","CO2 is good","manual"
"cw149hc","t3_3ouf0g","3ouf0g","environment","emotional","1. Yes, but we won't be able to scale up fast enough to address climate change in time. Given 100 years yes we could transition to solar and wind. But we only have 30-40 years to do it. Despite 20 years of massive growth and government subsidies, solar and wind today accounts for only a couple percentage points of total global electricity. Most renewable comes from hydro and that can't grow much more. Solar and wind will continue to grow, but unfortunately not fast enough. There are a number of reasons that make it so difficult: 1. New energy demand is growing rapidly so it needs to replace existing plus new. 2. The energy is diffuse, energy farming, requiring huge amounts of space which is disruptive and costly (new grids etc). 3. The energy is intermittent with the sun and wind.

2. Solar panels are mostly made in Asia which has a dirty grid mostly coal. Even so, an individual panel will offset over its lifetime more CO2 than it took to manufacture. However, the industry as a whole is growing rapidly and so every year more panels are being made than the last year. As a result, the panels already made are never able to offset the CO2 of the new panels being mfg -- they will eventually *if the industry stops growing* but that won't happen for a very long time. The solution is to buy solar panels from countries with clean(er) power such as USA and Europe. Or, slow down the mfg of panels so the existing ones are able to offset the new ones. Otherwise the solar industry has a net negative impact on global CO2 levels.","2015-10-15 21:21:41","1","FF00A7","1747868713.2093823","CO2 is good","manual"
