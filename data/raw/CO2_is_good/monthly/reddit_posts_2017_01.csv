"5n4gqb","collapse","skeptical","CO2 -- more positive feedbacks kicking in?","So we know that one of the big question marks in global warming is the speed with which certain positive feedbacks are going to unfold, and how many of them there are.  Even most of those that are known to exist and which will almost certainly play a big role in the near future are NOT included in any of the IPCC estimates simply because they don't have any good way of quantifying them... i.e. ""we don't understand it very well, so we'll just ignore it, even though it's important"".  This attitude makes some scientific sense, but is likely to produce scary surprises, such as the unexpectedly rapid meltdown of the Arctic.

There are many such possible positive feedbacks, some of which could be gigantic and unfold very rapidly, such as the permafrost melting and releasing all the carbon so far frozen into the ground there, or the so called 'methane hydrate bomb'.

Well, some such positive feedback just seems to have kicked in bigtime and nobody is talking about it yet... but over the last year or so, the amount of annual increase in CO2 in the atmosphere, as *meassured* (as opposed to estimated by fossil fuel consumption) just nearly doubled.  Yes, you read that right... a couple of years ago the annual increase was about 2 ppm, now it's nearly 4 ppm.  We just passed 400 ppm total CO2 in the atmosphere, so at the current rate we'll get to 500 in just about 25 years... *iff* it doesn't keep going up further.  You can get the basic info on this from the [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://www.co2.earth/).

So where is this extra CO2 coming from?  As best I can tell nobody knows yet, which is why you probably haven't heard much about this.  At first I thought ""it must be El Niño releasing ocean CO2"", but El Niño is well over, and the increased CO2 output continues unabated.  So it's something else... such as a new positive feedback... which in turn means that we're even more well and truly @#$%.

Be afraid.
