"2viqtb","environment","emotional","I quit my well-paying job to learn sustainable planting for two years because I believe we can stop the global warming by planting.","My name is Clement, I am 32, got my MS degree in US and worked in Germany for two years as a thin film solar cell R&D. The comfy job gave me enough time and money to travel across 14 European countries and more than 100 cities ~ lost count, simply too many. Sounds like a pretty good career path right? 
But I decided to quit the “dream job” and started to learn gardening two years ago in my native land Taiwan because I’ve seen too many terrible things are happening due to the global warming alone my journey and I believe that there is always a simple way to reduce the greenhouse gases and save our planet. 
“Replant the greens back”, and not just at homes but also at our hearts!! 
When I plant, I start to be more aware of our environment, and I believe everyone will feel the same.  
Anyone with me?
