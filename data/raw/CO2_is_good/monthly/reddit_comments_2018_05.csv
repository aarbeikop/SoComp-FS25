While at the surface you're taking responsibility for your environmentally damaging behavior, by trying to ""offset"" the consequences of your actions, you're in actuality deferring responsibility, either by literally ""paying off"" an organization to make you feel better, or planting some drop-in-the-bucket trees to have the same effect. 

It's not that these aren't positive efforts - they are, and they're more substantial than what most people do - but it contributes to the narrative that you can credit your ""environmental"" account with some pollution and then debit it with some environmentally beneficial action, balancing the account. 

But if you think about it, our account is already so deeply in the red that we can't afford a single credit and can't really even conceive of what a sufficient number of debits would look like to balance the account. 

What we really *need* to do is stop flying. But we can't, or won't, do that as a species (or the other myriad things we need to stop doing). So we take our little silk screen printed canvas tote bags to the store when we shop (only 20 or 30 times before we lose it or buy a new one, rather than the 150 necessary to offset the embodied energy and CO2 used to produce it) and donate to charities that plant trees or subsidize organic farming, because it all makes us feel better. 

To really, truly have an effect, even the modicum of an effect that is the result of personal environmentally benevolent behavior, make the conscious choice to not fly the same distance when the next opportunity arises. Inconvenience yourself, because an environmentally benevolent life is not a convenient life. And continue to inconvenience yourself, until you've changed your lifestyle.","2018-05-12 22:41:22","4","Twenty26six","1747896334.1057634","CO2 is good","manual"
"dyutotm","t3_8iuu3k","8iuu3k","environment","emotional","One way to look at it is the [CO2 abatement costs](https://ourworldindata.org/how-much-will-it-cost-to-mitigate-climate-change). This is a traditional supply curve used in economics.

The most commonly used version was published by McKinsey around 2010, so it's probably outdated to some degree.

Anyway, you can see that a lot of choice do not just save CO2, but money as well. Investments in LED lighting, energy-efficient electronics and appliances, for instance, will save you money.

It may also show that it's hard to answer the question what the theoretical price for reducing CO2 would be. After all, this is just the supply curve. One would also need a demand curve to estimate the ""correct"" price level.

Hope this helps.

If you want to atone for air travel, good for you, but rather than wasting money on the green version of papal indulgences, why not put a down payment on something that will actually cut your other emissions, such a solar system or a plug\-in electric car?","2018-05-13 03:43:47","1","Splenda","1747896334.1097846","CO2 is good","manual"
