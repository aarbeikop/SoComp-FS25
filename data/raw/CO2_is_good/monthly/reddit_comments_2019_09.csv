However can we reverse climate change by the end of our lifetimes? No. 

Most likely we can bring CO2 levels back to pre-industrial amount or even 350 ppm at the very least, by the middle to end of the next century. It's really not that far away considering everything. 

We can adapt to this, which is something that people seem to never talk about. There's such a huge push for switching over to renewables that people hardly seem to talk about how we also need to begin planning adaptation measures. It'll vary from region to region and some might not even need any aid at all.","2019-09-22 19:33:42","14","[deleted]","1747913623.1097844","CO2 is good","manual"

"f131c4u","t3_d7ms3u","d7ms3u","climatechange","action-oriented","In my opinion?

0% chance.

There are many theories, but I think the best one is this: The earth always had periods of heat and cold due to the distance between sun and earth. 
This makes our seasons and maybe this has lead to the fact that once Europe was covered by ice.

However even if this isn't the case, there is one thing for sure: CO2 isn't the Initiator, but the catalysator. 
We would have to take away large potions of the CO2 at once, which is only possible if we lower the emissions and plant so many trees that CO2 becomes O2 and C again. 

By only lowering the CO2 emissions nothing will change. Even more: If we would stop ALL CO2 emissions worldwide at once (which is impossible), the already existing CO2 would continue the climate change.

What people need to realize:

1. It's not 11:30, 11:55 or 12. It's already 6 in the afternoon. We are far beyond our limits. 

2. Climate Change isn't the only problem in this world. What about the pollution of the world by plastic in the ocean or oil? These problems needs to be adressed too ASAP. 

3. Climate Change protests need to become radical. You can't save the world by a new tax or by surfing from France to USA. You can only save the world by destroying this bad system and building a new one where nature is priority #1.","2019-09-22 11:19:36","-2","HeldDerZeit","1747913623.1254623","CO2 is good","manual"

A few more things to consider, which are impossible to predict, are the thawing out of old pathogens, the evolution of diseases, and the changing of disease vectors.

I don't know how much thinking has been done on the last two items except the spread of mosquitos, but consider how rapidly microbiotic environments are going to be evolving given the stress organisms are going to be under given the rapid changes of ecosystems. The interactions between organisms are also going to be wildly different as populations change and migrate, which suggests new disease vectors.

"f20q13t","t3_dbb5n2","dbb5n2","collapse","skeptical","I like it, however I would say 2 things are missing/off. You don't mention greenland at all, which will be melting at an alarming rate, esp once a BOE event occurs. This will raise the oceans faster than Antarctica will at least until Antarctica starts to really melt... which is 2050+.

India will 100% run out of water around 2025. First nation to collapse.

Also the ocreans will be 150% more acidic by 2050. This kills a lot of ocean life. Certain species are having issues today because of it. 

Also based off the data it looks like a BOE will now occur between 2025 - 2029. once this ice is gone and is unable to cool the oceans, the artic oceans will absorb the sun and heat up 80x faster.

And as a side note, everyone is worried about hard/mineral/energy resources. However i'd like to argue we will run out of food worldwide before we hit these resource limits. Aka by the time we are about to hit resource limits, we will have already lost 6.5 billion people (50% of our food will be destroyed by climate change), thus those resources will now last much longer with only a billion people on earth left. the only places left to live will be near the poles/west Antarctica. majority of all factories and enegry plants will be shutdown at this point and the aerosol dimming effect will vanish, giving us another +2c added on to our already +4c at 2050.

And war will definitely break out in Asia. I suspect will will be india and pakistan will go to war over water like you mentioned. I just think it will happen around 2030.
