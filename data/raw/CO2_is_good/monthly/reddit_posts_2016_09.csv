"52niqi","collapse","skeptical","The ""five eyes"" countries currently have a population of 454 million - after collapse that might not change much - everywhere else will be on their own.","Although they collectively have good regional food security, after climate changes cause wide variation in arable land use patterns/location their carrying capacity may drop.

However, the ""five eyes"" countries will stick together and collectively pull up their drawbridges using force if necessary.  

Everyone everywhere else is going to experience a shitstorm of violence, mass migrations, starvation and desperation before their eventual demise.

There will be a lot of murder amongst all that but it'll be being done by the participants themselves, not the bystanders.

Pockets of survivors will exist in enclaves in many countries but this little group ( Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) will be mostly insulated from the worst of the population drop.

That should bring us closer to the earth's carrying capacity (pre industrialisation) of the often cited 1.5 billion.

The big if is going to be the possibility of global catastrophic atmosphere degradation with low O2 and high CO2.  In that circumstance those who survive will only do so in what we have collectively started calling the ""green zones"" at the centre of which will be the atmospherically controlled biospheres.  Regional hospitals with IVF coldstores for biological diversity during the long-term hunkering down of humanity's downward spiral.

History is always written by the winners/survivors.  I wonder what they'll write.","2016-09-13 23:09:33","22","91","0.76","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/52niqi/the_five_eyes_countries_currently_have_a/","True","dominoconsultant","1747879027.938823","CO2 is good","manual"

I clicked on this sub from some article and was kind of expecting it to be full of far right wingnuts. I was pleasantly surprised to see the sidebar (anarchism, permaculture, etc) and comments.
