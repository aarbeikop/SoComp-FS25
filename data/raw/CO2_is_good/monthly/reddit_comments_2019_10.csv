https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf

"" For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. ""

"" There is low confidence in the scientific understanding of the small observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent due to the incomplete and competing scientific explanations for the causes of change and low confidence in estimates of natural internal variability in that region ""

"" There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a global scale ""

"" There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations ""

"" There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause ""

"" it is unlikely that global mean sea level will rise by more than one meter in this century, ""

So the IPCC itself says that there are no more flooding, hurricanes, droughts due to our Co2 emissions. They acknowledge that the Antarctic ice is constant or even growing. And the sea level will not rise a meaningful amount even in the next eighty years.

But there is more:

It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.

AR5 has a temperature graph SPM1a on page 3, where the temperature seems to have increased about 0.6 degrees C between 1951 and 2010, and basically they do not know how much of that is human caused, but it may be no more than half, so 0.6*0.5 = 0.3 degrees C. That is a far cry from the 0.9 degrees that the earth has warmed since 1850 according to the instrumental record, the IPCC is only claiming a third of this for ""anthropocentric"" Co2 emissions!

So what about the future?Well for the future temperature scenarios they need to use their models. But:

"" For the period from 1998 to 2012, 111 of the 114 available climate-model simulations show a surface warming trend larger than the observations (Box 1.1, Figure 1a). ""

So the IPCC themselves acknowledge that the models are running hot.

The IPCC has a separate section on the their model quality, .and they state

""The causes of both the observed GMST trend hiatus and of the model–observation GMST trend difference during 1998–2012 imply that, barring a major volcanic eruption, most 15-year GMST trends in the near-term future will be larger than during 1998–2012 (high confidence; see 11.3.6.3. for a full assessment of near-term projections of GMST). The reasons for this implication are fourfold: first, anthropogenic greenhouse-gas concentrations are expected to rise further in all RCP scenarios; second, anthropogenic aerosol concentration is expected to decline in all RCP scenarios, and so is the resulting cooling effect; third, the trend in solar forcing is expected to be larger over most near-term 15-year periods than over 1998–2012 (medium confidence), because 1998–2012 contained the full downward phase of the solar cycle; and fourth, it is more likely than not that internal climate variability in the near-term will enhance and not counteract the surface warming expected to arise from the increasing anthropogenic forcing. ""

So the IPCC have issued a very concrete short term prediction for the global warming from 2012 to about 2025-2030 where they are basically doubling down on the validity of the high co2-sensitivity of their models, and even using the term ""high confidence"". If global warming from 2012 to 2025 does not get back to the pace predicted by the models, then you can use the IPCCs own statements (""high confidence"") to refute them, they have really put their reputation and credibility on the line.

I feel like when talking to alarmists, I spend alot of time basically arguing to try to convince alarmists of things that I now realize the IPCC has already stated. I guess this is probably because noone actually reads the IPCC reports. So a good tip is to just quote the IPCC for these claims.

tl;dr:

The jist of the IPCC report is that they acknowledge that nothing much has happend yet, and even less of what has happend can be attributed to CO2, and the dire predictions rest solely on models that they themselves acknowledge are running too hot.","2019-10-28 18:02:13","0","chacer98","1747914403.6823163","CO2 is good","manual"

Ozone production/use near the surface of the earth does not affect ozone levels in the stratophere, which is what we're concerned about when we talk about he ozone layer.

Ozone is produced in the stratophere when UV rays break apart oxygen molecules and the oxygen atoms (O) then combine with oxygen molecules (O2) to form ozone (O3).
