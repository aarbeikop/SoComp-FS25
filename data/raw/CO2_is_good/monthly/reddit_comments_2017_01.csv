Forests, on the other hand, are known for reverting from a carbon sink to a carbon source when stressed by something, for example by a drought. So they would be my first guess when it comes to quick and unexpected CO2 increases like this.","2017-01-10 15:22:56","7","goocy","1747882729.527335","CO2 is good","manual"

"dc91p7e","t3_5n4gqb","5n4gqb","collapse","skeptical","I think that CO2 comes from the melting permafrost. That's not the Methane Hydrate bomb which is melting clathrates (frozen methane) under or captured by subsea and surface permafrost, releasing Methane (volume *120). The CO2 is from the permafrost itself, the soil. All kinds of little critters start to digest previously frozen organic matter and shit out CO2. It used to be too cold for that but now it starts to add up. There was a post about that same subject here recently ..

Something like this:

"dc9agiu","t3_5n4gqb","5n4gqb","collapse","skeptical","4ppm is misleading:

Dec 2015 = 401.85

Dec 2016 = 404.48

This represents an increase of 2.63ppm yoy.

To convert this ppm CO2 into GtCO2 you [multiply by 7.81](https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=45)

There is 20.54 GtCO2 more CO2 in the air than last year. The earth absorbs half so [41 GtCO2](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2764323/China-US-India-push-world-carbon-emissions-up.html) was emitted by man and natural forces.

In terms of PgC or GtC 41/3.67 = 11.17 GtC was emitted in the year and half was absorbed by the earth.

The remaining [carbon budget](http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI13-IPCCinfographic-FINAL_web.png) is 485PgC^2014 in 2017 it is 485-11-11 = 463PgC^2017

If we are to stay within their 2C limit we have 463/11= 42years at BAU levels.

Read the fine print at the [bottom](http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI13-IPCCinfographic-FINAL_web.png) If we factor non-CO2 gases the available budget drops to 275PgC^2014. Adjust that for now 275-11-11=253PgC^2017 or 23 years remaining. In ppm terms this would be 60ppm CO2 more or 22 years at current growth rate. 464ppm is the 2C budget target assuming all non-CO2 gases remain constant.

* Piece it all together. They are saying we have 20 years to reduce CO2 emissions to zero, otherwise we overshoot 2C.
* Albedo loss is not factored in as well, According to Wadhams a .6C rise can be attributed to arctic albedo loss alone.
* Global Dimming is only used as parameter to offset forcings. They have not included the implication SO2 reduction in emissions, you will get an immediate rise temps upto about 1C or [more](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/pmc205/papers/2005/Andreae_et_al_05_Nature.pdf).

>When we include the uncertainty caused by the choice of emission
scenarios, we find that the range considered most plausible in
IPCC-TAR (2.3–4.9 C from 1850–2100) can be obtained only for
aerosol forcings considerably weaker than predicted by current
forward models (Fig. 3), which tend to estimate the sum of aerosol
forcings to be in the range 21 to 22Wm22 (refs 11, 12, 16, 17).
Ominously, Fig. 3a shows temperature increases in excess of 6C for
the climate sensitivity implied by the central estimate of aerosol
forcing (21.5 Wm22
), and for all but the most optimistic emission
scenario. Such an enormous increase would be comparable to the
temperature change from the previous ice age to the present.
Furthermore, the overall uncertainty is dominated by climate sensitivity
and hence historical aerosol forcing: Fig. 3a shows that the
warming range for a given scenario (for example, 2.5–7.9 K for
scenario A2) is greater than the range across scenarios for a given
climate sensitivity (6.8–9.6 K at its widest).","2017-01-10 21:08:22","2","mulgs","1747882729.5466113","CO2 is good","manual"

"dc8ww6l","t3_5n4gqb","5n4gqb","collapse","skeptical","CO2 doesn't have positive feedbacks. 

The temperature increases/radiative forcing is defined as so and so many W/m^2 or C° per doubling of CO2. This means going from 200 to 400 is the same as going to 400 to 800 and 800 to 1600. This is a function of diminishing returns.

The actual values suggested to happen per doubling is subject to much debate(so much for consensus in climate science), ranging from less than 1°C or up to 10°C. Based on historical observations it leans towards less than 3(and 3-4) is what IPCC uses.

Anyway what this means is that even if you assume we can get to 6400ppm CO2, which is an increase of 6000 ppm from 400 today, it would only be a warming of 4 times the previously mentioned number. Also, to actually get to 6400ppm is unlikely given the half-life of CO2 and the timespans of emission involved, so there's no limitless warming potential to the climate models despite what doomspeaker and alarmists and headline merchants suggest all the fucking time, because they can skip the technical details and say that we're turning into Venus due to CO2 any day now(and if you plug the number of duplications needed to match some venusian parameters into a formula for CO2 doubling, you end up with a value where there amount of CO2 in earths atmosphere have more mass than the entire galaxy, so such a suggestion only collapses the credibility of whoever makes it) 

Even if you assume the worst case of warming from the IPCC(official predictions) you're still not going to cost much more in adaptation and material losses than an economical downturn does, if you want collapse porn then AGW and CO2 is a red herring, go look for geopolitical or economical reasons instead.
