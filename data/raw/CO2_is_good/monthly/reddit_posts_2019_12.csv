"ehoqoy","climatechange","action-oriented","Possible ramifications of Climate Change","Because I got into an argument with another person about his post in /r/climatechange, I suggested that we take the discussion to a new post.  There were several possible topics, so I chose one at random.  I'd like to discuss what the near term (3 decades) ramifications there are of Climate Change.  We can't really do a good job of estimating out farther than that, I think, because we don't know what will happen policially or technologically, but near term, we've got a decent idea.

So, what are the opinions out there, and what science do we have to back up those opinions.  I'll go first:

Florida is not going to be underwater (outside of some temporary flooding in some coastal cities) within the next 3 decades.  I offer as proof the NOAA records of about 100 years of Tide Gauge data showing that Florida has been experiencying under 3 mm per year Sea Level Rise for almost the entire time.  SLR rates vary, but have been everywhere from about 2mm per year to a bit over 3 mm per year.  The long term trends are about 2.5 mm per year (about an inch per decade).  Unless we see some very severe departure from the long term trend, Florida won't be underwater in 2050.","2019-12-30 17:09:29","5","87","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ehoqoy/possible_ramifications_of_climate_change/","True","deck_hand","1747916142.8285904","CO2 is good","manual"
"e9vc1t","climatechange","action-oriented","For those high school or college students worried about climate change... (Advice)","I was 16 when I learned about climate change/read the IPCC and knew then that shit was going to hit the fan and affect my future. From that moment, I decided I would dedicate my life to learning about it and doing what I could to fix it. 10 years later I have a masters in climate science and working towards a doctorate. There are options out there for people who want to make a difference but choosing the correct outlet (major in college, courses, etc) is important to get you to the right spot, I didn’t know what to look for or how to get into the field of climate change. Academia is not for everyone but it should not be overlooked - multidisciplinary studies are needed between STEM and humanities for this crisis. No matter what you want your future career to be, you can in someway incorporate climate change and sustainability. I mention a few tips below but feel free to ask any questions about the field of climate science or how to incorporate it into a future career path. (My guidance counselor in high school had no idea what to tell me and I ended up changing my major twice - I want to be sure advice is available for those who are interested!)

1) just because you are bad at math or chemistry does not mean you would not make an excellent scientist or researcher, no one is perfect and everyone has their strengths/weaknesses

2) if you want to focus on climate change or just want to learn more about it, try to major/minor in earth science/geology - it will give you a good background. Even just taking one or more earth sciences classes is really beneficial! If you don’t see climate on the syllabus - ask your teacher or professor to address it in class. Public schooling doesn’t do the best job of talking about the intersections of chem, bio, physics but geology/earth science does. Also talk to professors/teachers about what your interests are, they should be able to help you find a direction better than a guidance counselor

3) incorporate your anxieties of climate change into your work. Incorporate the idea of being sustainable into everyday life. Class project/paper/presentation? Incorporate climate change. Sometimes you have to be creative with how things are interwoven but honestly it will affect most everything - economics, health, ecosystems, food + water supplies, real estate, politics, social sciences, etc. Addressing it from every angle will help us to be more prepared. Also it could give you leverage when applying for jobs etc that you have a multidisciplinary outlook.

4) if you are interested in climate science or research, look online for universities with research programs based on climate change that are in your interest. Reach out to professors to see if they need undergraduate helpers - I have seen these opportunities turn into masters many times. 

Please only ask relevant questions, not here for the denial trolls.","2019-12-12 23:13:08","11","24","0.73","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e9vc1t/for_those_high_school_or_college_students_worried/","True","paleoclimatologist11","1747916205.2907898","CO2 is good","manual"

**First you use the term NetZeroCO2e with no definition. Second you put per capita data there which have zero purpose. Additionally comparing emissions by GDP serves zero purpose. Every scientist knows pollution is measured and reported by mass not per capita or GDP.  Even the IPCC scientists don’t do this. This is the stupidity of the United Nations reports. This is a fact: The USA has had a 16% drop in emissions of GHG since 2006. Europe has a 21% drop since 1990. Only China and India are increasing. Also you believe the garbage in IPCC SR 1.5 Chapter two. The table ES.1 Global total emissions in 2030 column are from garbage simulations with no boundary conditions. Please see the attached and rewrite the report. Should I perform expert review of your report and send it to 5000 scientists as well?** 

**Also you and all IPCC scientists know the minimum residence time for atmospheric CO2 has increased more than 200 years. Just how, with emissions work, are you able to lower atmospheric CO2?**

http://cctruth.org/expert\_review\_SR1.5\_mitigation.pdf

Already planting 3 billion trees and the global garden greening atmospheric CO2 minimum on October 4th was 407.51 ppm. Dr Pieter Tans said it should be 408.6+/- 0.5. This is more than 1.0 ppm lower!  For November the rise was **-0.45 ppm**. (11/1= 411.02, 4/20=410.57), November of 2017 it was 2.7 ppm rise. November 2018 1.85 ppm rise.

I have 8 billion more trees scheduled in the next 4 years. We can easily plant 100 billion trees in the USA and in 10 years will consume an extra 10 billion tons annually. A 2003 IPCC report shows the minimum residence time for atmospheric CO2 is 200 years. Just how does the UN or IPCC expect to have any effect with lower CO2 by working on emissions?

Earlier I sent this to 5000 scientists and all the worldwide media by email with delivery and read receipts. They are reading it. Around December 15th I will send it to all IPCC scientists. I showed their simulations to an expert in simulations and he started uncontrollable laughter. **The worldwide media needs to expose the IPCC and your garbage.** The IPCC scientists act like they are “Gods” and everyone will go along with what they say.  Are there any investigative journalists left? I put a link to chapter two in the attached document. As I said I sent this to 5000 scientists including NOAA scientists. One NOAA scientist replied and said I should go after the publishers of the IPCC reports. I thanked him and said I would if I had a large staff of scientists.

We are scientists who follow the data. The IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) does not perform correct science. I performed expert analyses for the SR 1.5 Chapter 2 mitigation.  It’s all wrong.  I sent it to the media and they will not tell the truth. The attachment their report I reviewed!  

Key findings:

1.            Their so called equilibrium statement had no references to any published work.

2.            I sent emails to Chapter two authors and Dr. Hauptmann replied. It is not an equilibrium statement it’s from a simulation.

3.            I looked at their simulations and they are garbage because they don’t have boundary conditions. Their simulation goes past zero to negative emissions. This is why nothing they have predicted has or will come true.

4.            They use the term NetZeroCO2e without definition.

5.            They use nonscientific terms like highly likely instead of probability.

6.            Their only use of probability shows their solution for lowering CO2 by working on emissions is 50-66%. It’s actually zero because the minimum residence of atmospheric CO2 is hundreds of years. Planting trees is 100% probable to lower CO2.

7.            No one and No media should trust the IPCC.

These IPCC scientists know how to perform cause and effect analyses just like I am an expert at. However they don’t perform them because it does not fit their false agenda.   Also we recently wrote the world’s first Atmospheric Carbon dioxide equilibrium paper. The term NetzeroCO2 has never been defined previously. NetZeroCO2e=9.2gt/yr. Natural emissions are 20 gt/yr. This is why anything we do with emissions will never get us to equilibrium. We can easily plant 100 billion native trees in the USA and in 10 years will increase photosynthesis consumption of CO2 by 10 gt/yr. Trees have many advantages. They shade the earth, consume CO2, soak up the sun  and release terpenes which seed clouds and causes extra rain.","2019-12-07 23:58:53","0","3","0.23","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/e7m48t/emissions_gap_report_2019_more_garbage/","True","cctruth","1747916264.7722843","CO2 is good","manual"

Davey wishes Goliath merry xmas, sells hopium on the sly.

David listened to the IEA. In 2008 the IEA said peak oil would be early as 2011. The IEA didn't account for the frack boom.  When the experts can't tell what's going on in their own business, what does that tell you?  The Saudi IPO has come back from the dead so many times it's going to get its own seasonal television deal.

David says we should ignore the RCP8.5 scenario and that the best worst case scenario is 2.5 C without action, which means there's room for hope if we reduce emissions fast. Economic growth and energy growth near never vary more than 3% / yr.

By listening to only an energy perspective, David is failing to consider runaway drivers working intersectionally to trigger collapse. Once collapse starts, it cannot be stopped or reversed. Note to Dinosaurs: That's why all the young people in the world are revolting, even children in the Congo know they're getting a raw deal, especially compared to Leonardo DiCaprio.

Why do you think so-called experts say we can have 100% renewables by 2050 when they know it's not true.

Answer = $$$

Young people are progressive, old people are not, but we were progressive once too, as impossible as it seems all the old lizards in your life were once hot swinging guys and chicks. When I tell my nephew his mother was once a hot chick, he kind of loses it.

Selling out ideals is what makes humanity special because it's a survival mechanism. We need to fool our brains occaisionally to survive. It's just that survival has allowed that trait to flourish, if not go runaway. I personally think we are in a distorted runaway evolution. Our bodies are shinking and curving while we go fetal over our phones.

Coal has always been humanity's base power. Coal is being turned into natural gas in South Asia because of air pollution avoidance, not climate change, I wouldn't be surprised if they get carbon credits for doing it. It takes fossil energy to turn coal into gas. Carbon credit fraud is financial fraud. If you took an Occupy Wall Street pig from 2009, put lipstick on it and set it free to fly... you now understand carbon credits. It's carbon credits that are destroying the world's forests. Planting 20 million bucks in tree seeds on YT is not going to stop forest fires.

The pillars of life on earth are cascading tipping points. Tipping points are cumulative, irreversible and unstoppable.

The tipping point for life on earth is 1.5 C, but hold on it gets worse. The Climate Sensitivity of earth to warming stimulus is 40% worse than expected. The die off rate of species is a 1,000% worse than expected. The ability of renewables to displace fossils is 1,000% worse than expected. Rapid extreme onset acidification and methane offgassing of oceans is 1,000% worse than expected.  The health dangers of nano micro plastics and minerals on our brains and bodies is 1,000% worse than expected. Our food, water safety and security are 1,000% worse than expected. The explosive debt of our financial system is 1,000% worse than expected. The MIC/MSM political disinfo danger is 1,000% worse than expected. You can't spend a trillion bucks per year killing people and save the earth, at the same time.  There hasn't been a Soviet Union for a billion years, and China has already won the cold war.

All this nonsense started in 1913 . Prohibition did for crime what the New Deal did for America.

This may be our last good xmas, so forget all this and enjoy it. Here's a present for cousin cranky.
