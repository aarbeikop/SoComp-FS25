"eeycsl2","t3_ajs3vs","ajs3vs","climatechange","action-oriented","Your friend's interpretation of these model outputs is fine, as far as it goes. You can't say he's wrong. The best you can say is that there are other data and other models which can support a different interpretation. It's up to you whether you feel analytically grounded enough to enter a battle of models and interpretations.

This is the problem with trying to reduce extremely complex systems to models: There will always be wide ranges of models, methods, relevant datasets and interpretations. 

One method which I prefer as a starting point is to set models aside for a moment, and focus instead on empirical data: These data incontrovertibly show increases in terrestrial heat-energy reservoirs, prominently including the surface and troposphere, at around the same time that we've seen massive increases in the greenhouse-gas content of the atmosphere. 

That's proof of correlation, not proof of causation, so it's important not to overstate the value of this evidence. But the correlation, taken together with other empirical data if you wish, do strongly support a hypothesis of continued warming. 

That's a really good place to start. From there you can try to bring in models to attribute some percentage of warming to manmade GHG emissions — but at that point you're not really convincing anyone, you're just supporting your empirical point with added speculation. 

Adding speculation and model interpretations to empirical data is a fine enough analytic method on its own — it's how science goes forward. But it's not strong enough evidence to rule out other people's interpretations which start from approximately the same empirical data. We don't yet have climate-science methods that allow us to zero in on one model or one interpretation as the correct one. We have to remain open to everything that remains plausible but unproved...until it's actually disproven.  ","2019-01-25 19:26:14","9","DocHarford","1747906789.738559","CO2 is good","manual"

The second is that this 30yr old obsolete model actually does surprisingly well considering how simple it was. Your friend talks about emissions being above Scenario B, but that is only looking at CO2, while there are other GHG that affect the climate. Methane in particular is faster acting than CO2, so where did CH4 track? [RealClimate](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2018/06/30-years-after-hansens-testimony/) have looked into this and say that the most other GHG emissions have been tracking at or below Scenario C, so the overall anthropogenic forcing has been somewhere between B and C. Taking that into account, Hansen 1988 does surprisingly well for such a simple climate model. Later models have generally done better. 

Finally, the ""settled science"" schtick. Conservation of energy is a cornerstone of physics, it's pretty much as ""settled"" as you get, and that's all global warming is. If you let less energy leave a system (by blocking LW radiation leaving), then it warms up. So that's ""settled"". But scientists are still actively researching the details - how fast the warming will be, how much it will warm to equilibrium etc. So that's not settled.

"eeyr3u4","t3_ajs3vs","ajs3vs","climatechange","action-oriented","The models are doing well despite what anyone says: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/climate-model-projections-compared-to-observations/ And if the models were substantially different from observations in a way that was unexpected then there would need to be a rethinking of what we know about forcings. But whether humans are having an influence or not is beyond question at this point. The temperature rise we have experienced is probably higher than anything experienced in the holocene. [Here is a graph](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png) of temperatures from the last 12,000 years at a 20 year resolution. That graph is from [this paper by Marcott](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~mli/Economics%207004/Marcott_Global%20Temperature%20Reconstructed.pdf). Also note how the modern instrument records is a huge unnatural looking spike. If there were a huge spike like that anywhere in the proxy records we would be able to see it.

The first prediction of a large temperature rise due to carbon emissions was made in 1896 by [Svante Arrhenius](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_3.php), his rough calculation was high but it was very good considering the small amount of information he had. He correctly calculated the right order of magnitude of the change. And now we have instrumental observations that show temperatures have risen at a pace that still has no known precedence [ [In the past century alone, the temperature has climbed 0.7 degrees Celsius, roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page3.php) ] rise to a point that has not been seen in *at least* [2000 years](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott_PAGES2k.png). Could the early scientists have gotten lucky with their prediction? That they could predict a huge unprecedented temperature rise that has no known precedent of happening in many thousands of years and then for it to happen directly after making the prediction. You at least have to admit that the sharp temperature spike looks a lot like [this graph](https://climate.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/24_co2-graph-021116-768px.jpg).  

But you know it's not just the basic physics and the observation of correlation that is convincing, but most people don't seem to understand that there are physical fingerprints in the atmosphere that show us what is causing the warming. For instance did you know that while the troposphere is warming the stratosphere is actually cooling? This happens as a transient effect when a large amount of greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere this blocks infrared radiation from reaching into the stratosphere, and so it cools. This effect has been observed and any other known source of temperature change would not have this result. If the Sun were the cause then all layers of the atmosphere would warm. If you want to dig deeper: [[1]](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/10/1305332110) [[2]](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1256/qj.02.186)

And it's not just that the stratosphere is cooling but also the diurnal temperature range (daily macimum and minimum temperature difference) is decreasing and the tropopause height is increasing. These observable effects are what go into fingerprint attribution studies. They can not be explained without a large greenhouse gas effect. Looking at these effects is just one method of attribution as well, there are many papers using different methods that come to a similar conclusion that humans are the cause. [This graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change#/media/File:Attribution_of_global_warming.jpg) was developed from an IPCC report that weighed all the different studies. 

EDIT: More to their point we have simply learned more about climate sensitivity in that time. Hansens's value for climate sensitivity is higher than the average we think now. And the 80s were when the first serious models were being made, we shouldn't expect it to be perfect. Scientists have already looked at the early models critically and improved on them. They made the same observation that this person is making and moved forward and incorporated new better knowledge of the atmosphere, this person is 30 years behind the science.","2019-01-25 21:52:50","2","[deleted]","1747906789.7525697","CO2 is good","manual"

> On the contemporary Earth, gas hydrate is dissociating in specific  terrains in response to post‐LGM climate change and probably also due to  warming since the onset of the Industrial Age. Nevertheless, there is  no conclusive proof that the released methane is entering the atmosphere  at a level that is detectable against the background of \~555 Tg yr−1 CH4  emissions. The IPCC estimates are not based on direct measurements of  methane fluxes from dissociating gas hydrates, and many numerical models  adopt simplifications that do not fully account for sinks, the actual  distribution of gas hydrates, or other factors, resulting in probable  overestimation of emissions to the ocean‐atmosphere system.

Greenhouse gases spread globally, and while a rise in CO₂ concentration has certain effects on living things, it cannot be easily smelled or sensed.

3: Forests are part of the carbon cycle, so a forest fire does not release additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

And yet, due to (as far as I can tell) institutional inertia and conforming to long established standards, most papers compare methane to CO2 on a 100 year scale. You'll see many papers stating that methane is 20x or 25x more powerful than CO2. But that's using GWP100. Thing is, over a 20 year timeframe, CH4 is \~85x more potent than CO2. (see EPA website below)

If we were sitting in the year 1850, GWP100 could make sense, as we'd be thinking about how our behavior affects long term climate change. But this is 2019. We've already seen 1 degree C rise. Our predicament is urgent. We need to be accounting for how emissions today contribute to global warming over the next few years.  We want to avoid tripping off cascading warming events. 

Given all this, please consider that roughly 1.5 billion head of cattle worldwide account for 35-40% of human caused methane emissions, and by using GWP100, we are probably under-calling the effect of these animals by at least 3x.   


**What you can do:** 

1. read up on GWP20 and GWP100 and consider both in every discussion about methane. 
2. Find plant based alternatives to dairy and beef.  
3. Urge people around you to find plant based alternatives to dairy and beef. ([challenge22.com](https://challenge22.com) is helpful)
4. Call your reps and tell them to end subsidies to animal ag - esp those for dairy and cattle ranching. And, if your political ideology allows it, tell them you want a dairy and meat tax too.
5. Support organizations like [rowdygirlsanctuary.com](https://rowdygirlsanctuary.com) and their RAP - Rancher's Advocacy Program - that helps animal farmers and ranchers transition to low carbon / low cruelty businesses. 
6. Support my lobbying campaign to end US fed subsidies to animal ag ([https://www.lobbyists4good.org/animal-ag-subsidies](https://www.lobbyists4good.org/animal-ag-subsidies) ). We've already crowd-funded 1 full month of lobbying (and I'm going to DC for 3 weeks to lobby along with our lobbyist). We'd love to crowd-fund another month. The focus of this campaign is 100% environmental - reducing animal ag in order to lower methane emissions and thus global warming.

Note: this is not to diminish our call to transition from fossil fuel energy to clean energy sources. This is simply another component we need to tackle. And we don't have time to put it in climate action plan 2.0. We need to cut out beef and dairy NOW.

See EPA website for a discussion of GWP 20 vs GWP100 as well as the lifetime of a single methane emission. Their wording feels slightly to favor GWP100, but at least they explain the difference.

1. Collaborate. Work with others to do something real about climate change. 

2. Bring the conversation to everyone's attention. It's not just about discussing it, it's about getting people to do something. We only probably have the near future to work with. 

3. Don't think that doing one thing is doing your duty. Do everything you can on all sorts of levels. Consume less, lobby more, change lifestyle, make and push for changes. And so on.

Here is a good part from a book called ""Too many people?"" (the book does NOT agree with the overpopulation idea in case you were wondering)

>The “global sect of greedy gluttons,” as journalist Hervé Kempf calls the super-rich,33 occupies global ecological space and generates pollution vastly out of proportion to its numbers. Any attempt to attribute the environmental crisis to “American consumption” (or British, or Australian, or Canadian, or . . .) misses the target if it doesn’t recognize:  
>  
>• The richest 1 percent of Americans take in and spend more than the bottom 40 percent.  
>  
>• The richest 5 percent of Americans own more than everyone else in the United States combined.34  
>  
>• The bottom 80 percent of Americans account for less than 40 percent of consumer spending.35  
>  
>• In Australia, eleven very rich individuals own more than the country’s 800,000 poorest households combined.36  
>  
>• The 147 individuals who topped the 2002 Forbes “World’s Richest People” list had total wealth equal to the total annual income of three billion people, half of the world’s population.37  
>  
>In the face of these facts, overpopulation pales as a social issue. To quote Guardian columnist George Monbiot: “It’s time we had the guts to name the problem. It’s not sex; it’s money. It’s not the poor; it’s the rich.”38

That being said, nations in the first world will have to tackle more than the 1% in order to reduce emissions (though the 1% will still pay the most). Stan Cox (an ecosocialist) argues that [the 33% wealthiest in America will need to make some noticeable sacrifices](http://greensocialthought.org/content/33-percent-will-have-pick-tab-climate-conversion).

Finally, the crimes of the Capitalists like Elon aren't limited to their personal emissions alone (I would say their personal emissions are the least worst thing about them). Their desire to amass profit has led to planned obsolescence, outsourcing, agroindustry and so on and don't get me started on their efforts to sabotage any attempts to serve people.

The mega-rich are most definitely at least 20x as pollutive as most Westerners, simply because they have more money to burn.  The fact that people accuse all Westerners of being wasteful is utter shit anyways though, just think about all the homeless, the lower-income people who are unable to go on vacation, and those forced to use public transportation/living in cities.

Things are more spread out in America, but people still tend to live close to work if they can, and gas is expensive as shit in Europe.  Nobody wastes fuel unless they can afford it, and yachts/private jets are so much more wasteful than passenger crafts that it's just stupid to even make the argument.
