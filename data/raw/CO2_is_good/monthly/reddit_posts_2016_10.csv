"58yqp8","climate","scientific","How much fossil fuels have humans extracted/burned?","I find it hard to locate good information on how much fossil fuels we have extracted and burned.

If you know of a reliable source for this kind of information, please let me know.

I am wondering whether it would be possible to construct an argument for climate change by comparing the amount of CO2 that we have added to the atmosphere (adjusted for the amount absorbed by the oceans) with the Keeling Curve

Is this feasible, or just plain stupid?

"568bro","environment","emotional","Since nobody at r/askscience cared, would massive scale personal carbon sequestration work?","Here's the idea in a nutshell: Bury carbon. From dead (fallen) trees, alive trees, grass, left over food. Any plant matter at all really, since plants absorb CO2 gas and transforms it into the physical matter it consists of.

What do we bury it in? Well according to a study I read, you can bury trees at 15 meters depth (50 feet) to avoid the matter to become gas again, which is too much for any single person to dig.

So instead, create a capsule of some kind. Made out of cement, or metal that won't corrode, or maybe even plastic seeing how it doesn't break down. Then bury, or maybe just place, that pod in nature somewhere. Just out in the woods somewhere, and leave it there for hundreds of years.

This way carbon gets stuck in solid form and gets pulled out of the life cycle of all plants, thus **sequestering carbon from the atmosphere in a way that can be done by normal people**, because let's face it, there really aren't any other solutions like this out there.

If it's doable, and enough people do it...... yeah?

"596r6v","collapse","skeptical","Climate change denial on /r/collapse","Hey /r/collapse,

It is the position of the moderation team that climate change is real, is largely man-made and is likely to have negative consequences for us in the near future.  We believe that the vast majority of /r/collapse shares this view.  To that end, when users post content rejecting the large and convincing amount of evidence supporting climate change, we've removed those posts for violations of rule 4 which states ""No conspiracy theories/provably false material.""

Since the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/about/rules/) here on /r/collapse were decided upon some time ago, we've had very few cases of people posting conspiracy theories and the vast majority of removals under rule 4 were for climate denial.

We'd like to change rule 4 to the following:

> **4. No climate change denial**
#
> Posts that are found to suggest the idea that climate change isn't happening, or that it isn't man made, or that it isn't a bad thing, will be removed.  Users are free to discuss climate skepticism in comments.

Skepticism is a big part of how science works and it isn't our intention to stifle reasonable discussion about climate science.  You would be, as the rule suggests, free to comment and express whatever ideas you wish.  However if you wish to post refutations of the state of climate science here on /r/collapse, they would have to take the form of a peer reviewed paper or study.  Blog posts, news articles, studies from the Heartland institute or videos from PragerU suggesting that climate change isn't real would be removed.

I would like to hear from you guys about our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/about/rules/), our stance on climate science and what sort of forum you want /r/collapse to be.  Please respond to this post and let us know if we're going in the right direction on this.

Thanks,

The moderation team of /r/collapse","2016-10-24 20:08:58","84","166","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/596r6v/climate_change_denial_on_rcollapse/","True","babbles_mcdrinksalot","1747879841.055751","CO2 is good","manual"
