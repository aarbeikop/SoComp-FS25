Firstly, are we talking about a huge change? What would be ""huge""?  We're talking about warming of about 3K for a doubling from 300ppm to 600ppm compared to a base temperature of 288K. That's a 1% increase. And the direct CO2 influence before feedbacks is actually 1K, so a 0.3% effect.

But that's actually not terribly relevant as it turns out. Greenhouse gases like CFC-12 have a current atmospheric concentration several orders of magnitude smaller than CO2 (500 parts per trillion vs. 400 parts per million) yet if the Montreal Protocol had not been implemented warming due to increasing CFC-12 and similar gases with even tinier concentrations might have been nearly as great as CO2. The CO2 effect is much weaker per molecule because a large fraction of the CO2 part of the absorption spectrum is already highly saturated, both due to existing CO2 and an overlap with water vapour. Whereas CFC-12 and similar absorb in a largely untouched part of the spectrum.

A lot of people seem to misunderstand the greenhouse effect as being about direct heating via atmospheric absorption, but that's not how it works. The way it works is by modifying the altitude of average IR emission to space in an atmosphere in which temperature declines with altitude. As you fill up the atmosphere with more CO2 the chance of a single photon making its way from the surface directly out to space unimpeded gets smaller. And indeed the chance of any photon making its way from any layer of the atmosphere out to space without being captured declines. Necessarily that means the average height of IR emission to space is elevated. Since temperature declines with altitude in the troposphere and the average height of IR emission (sometimes called the emission layer) is currently well within the troposphere this means the average temperature of total IR emission declines as CO2 increases. And since total energy emitted is proportional to the fourth power of temperature the amount of outgoing energy declines. This means there is less energy going out than coming in and the system warms.

In specifics a doubling of CO2 raises the average height of IR emission to space by about 100 metres. Given the standard atmospheric temperature ""lapse rate"" of 10K per km altitude, that means the emission layer is colder by 1K. The equilibrium emission layer temperature is 255K, governed by the solar input - albedo and the Stefan-Boltzmann law (255\^4 \* 0.0000000567 = 240W/m2; solar input 1360W/m2 \* 0.25 (sphere) \* 0.7 albedo = \~240W/m2). Reducing the emission layer temperature by 1K to 254K reduces outgoing energy to 236W/m2, a reduction of 4W/m2. This is the CO2 forcing.","2019-05-25 11:15:20","3","skeeezoid","1747910241.2839887","CO2 is good","manual"

You are trying to apply you intuitions developed to deal with objects you can touch and see to entities small enough to be influenced by de Broglie wavelengths and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. At sea level particles will experience 10 billion collisions a second. I have not worked out the density of 15 micrometer photons in the flux from a blackbody at 287K but it is plausible molecules may be absorbing and emitting photons millions of times a second. 

At 15 micrometers (roughly the peak blackbody wavelength of the Earths average surface temperature, 14C) , every time a molecule absorbs this photon it gains 0.0827 eV. It gains a significant amount of kinetic energy and has 10 billion collisions a second to pass that energy on. 

If you want to get gnarly with the process at first year type physics level, these are the numbers you have to start thinking about.","2019-05-25 19:32:29","1","[deleted]","1747910241.2879956","CO2 is good","manual"
"eozgfnf","t3_bsn2lt","bsn2lt","climatechange","action-oriented","At least one of the web pages you've read claims that CO2 ""traps"" heat. That is a misconception that emerged early on in the current ""crisis"" and which has stuck with us. Gases do not warm by exposure to IR radiation. Gases heat up only by mechanical transfer, meaning heat transfer by contact. CO2 could be doubled or tripled and it could not have any heat trapping effect, just as we could vary any other gas without effect. 

The IR spectrum of frequencies is 100um wide. CO2 is opaque to IR at only 3 peak frequencies, [2.7, 4.3, and 15um] (https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fslideplayer.com%2Fslide%2F4178834%2F14%2Fimages%2F42%2FIR%2BAbsorption%2BSpectrum%2Bof%2BCO2.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fslideplayer.com%2Fslide%2F4178834%2F&docid=YKpcdLD7GmOXRM&tbnid=iDkbtJGKX4lcjM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwiU3aulzdTgAhUIslQKHVF1BkEQMwhQKAUwBQ..i&w=960&h=720&client=firefox-b&bih=622&biw=1024&q=co2%20ir%20absorption%20spectrum&ved=0ahUKEwiU3aulzdTgAhUIslQKHVF1BkEQMwhQKAUwBQ&iact=mrc&uact=8). All other IR passes through the molecule. Solid matter, like the ground of Earth is opaque to all IR frequencies, and like every molecule the ground radiates IR at frequencies limited by it's temperature. The concern of AGW proponents is that the extra CO2 will intercept the outgoing IR and re-radiate that back down thereby causing further heating. CO2 does not prevent heat from escaping, but according to the AGW model it slows down the eventual re-emission of IR to space. 

From the above we can score one point for AGW since we can't deny that effect. However, there is the matter of how much that extra warming means to the actual temperature change that has been observed. According to AGW theory, the tiny increase in radiated IR induced by CO2 acts as a forcing on water vapour (WV). WV is opaque to huge range of IR and is by far the only GHG that has ever made a difference in temperature. You may have read that without WV Earth would be a snowball. 
As I said, CO2 opacity peaks at 15um, but the curve of the absorption band includes weak opacity at 12 um. (weak means that most of the 12um IR passes through and only a few photons are absorbed) WV overlaps CO2 at that 12um frequency and that is what all the fuss is about - one weak frequency out of a band 100um wide. 

WV has the ability to ""trap"" heat only due to the high heat capacity of the H2O molecule in it’s liquid form. Water does not heat up or cool down quickly and it makes up 2/3 of the surface of the planet. That makes water in all it's forms the modulator of climate, not CO2. It's been estimated that global humidity should rise ~4% for each 1C rise in temperature, which is exactly what we're seeing now.","2019-05-27 12:37:28","1","there_ARE_watches","1747910241.2924984","CO2 is good","manual"
"eop21xb","t3_bsn2lt","bsn2lt","climatechange","action-oriented"," Most people incorrectly think that Co2 is absorbing more heat, when in reality it is actually the high altitude cooling effect that causes the lower atmospheric heating.

Co2 causes the upper atmosphere to cool slightly(because it absorbs and re-emits IR), which slightly contracts the atmosphere, which reduces the surface area of the surface of last scattering. When you reduce the surface area, but keep the heating constant, it warms.

The surface of last scattering is the point where the air becomes thin enough that IR can actually travel straight to space. This happens at 6-8km(depends on local conditions), below about 6km, IR(~5nm and ~15nm) is 100% opaque within a short distance.","2019-05-25 02:56:53","0","FireFoxG","1747910241.2946103","CO2 is good","manual"

>Water vapor is more impactful as a greenhouse gas than CO2. And most people would prefer the stable temperatures of a sea climate (much water vapor) to inland desert climate (little water vapor). The desert climate simply fluctuates too much for people. So it seems that CO2 also has this stabilizing effect.

They won’t don’t know about the mass extinctions, or crop failures, drought, mass climate change migrations and refugees, lack of jobs and economy, most likely a long term global financial crisis, mass suicides and death and so on.

Throw in a climate of economic contraction (worse than is currently causing higher education and R&D to be starved back to bare bones) and it looks even worse. Academic research is a pernicious pyramid scheme anyway so most people are forced to realise it leads nowhere and get out before their investment is rewarded.

I love plants so I am now running my own experimental farm.

I know it seems like a Gordian knot, I know the human condition is MADDENING, but that's just because the smartest ppl on the planet are pulling on the wrong thread. 

We need to look at the planet as a whole. Earth doesn't have too many antelope, or too many grizzly bears, or too many elephants - it has too many people - each of whom needs water, food and air - the same resources I myself require. Earth contains plenty of food, water and air - there's just too many ppl  here at the same time. It really is as simple as that. Scarcity is the real problem. It's the Reason we build all our machines in the first place.

You seem to be looking at the problem through your own livelihood - which is itself the problem. Your're concerned both with your own survival/success and that of the whole, and they are diametrically opposed. There's nothing we can do for ourselves, but if we weren't so concerned with ourselves we could potentially spare future generations by taking the appropriate action during our lifetimes. Will we? Doubtful since our attention has been so abused and misdirected our intelligence and potential are turned against each other when we could be creatively working together against a non-terrestrial threat. How cool would that be? Sadly, I'm not talking about aliens.  

We need to modify the global environment in a way that would allow all human organs to work they way they're supposed to - the way they were 'designed' to. One of them is currently malfunctioning - tweaked into a state of hyperactivity by a force we can barely comprehend, so we've taught ourselves to ignore it. We don't even have the words to effectively describe 'infection' or 'contamination' by an inorganic agent of particulate size - how could we be expected to understand one that's 2,000 miles wide?  

So what if we can't understand it? That doesn't mean we can't break it. Considering what's at stake here - we owe it to our descendants to at least try, but that's unlikely to happen because of the social structure - the segmented STEM structure which has made a mystery out of the obvious is largely responsible for that. The malleability of our self-reflection, giving rise to the ego, is responsible for the rest.
