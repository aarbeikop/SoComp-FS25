"3qq6av","climate","scientific","[DISCUSSION] I'm confused about CO2 emissions and how they relate to plants.","In Biology class today, we were talking about how burning fossil fuels makes CO2 available to plants, whereas before as a fuel, the carbon is not accessible to plants for use. 

I know that my fish tank likes having liquid C02 added to it, to help the plants grow. It's my understanding that plants need CO2, and the more they have, the more they can grow. 

Sooooo...why the hell isn't CO2 emissions from fossil fuels really good for plant growth? ","2015-10-29 17:11:56","2","5","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3qq6av/discussion_im_confused_about_co2_emissions_and/","True","Raltie","1747868593.165949","CO2 is good","manual"
"3ouf0g","environment","emotional","Can we power the world through renewables alone (and two other questions)?","I recently had a conversation with quite a weird guy in my college bar. He seemed to believe that I was radically in favour of solar energy and thought we should be powering the global economy with that alone (even though I hadn't said anything of the sort). He 'refuted' this by saying that we can't even harvest enough renewable energy to meet the needs of the human race. In other words, if we covered every building in solar panels, put wind turbines on every hill, we still wouldn't generate enough energy for everyone.

This set off my scepticism, since I've read in Information is Beautiful, that covering 0.5% of the USA in wind turbines would meet the country's energy needs (that's still a big area, I know, but it strongly suggests to me that we can currently meet humanity's energy needs through renewables alone).

He then told me that solar panels couldn't even generate enough electricity to make up for the deficit in fossil fuels used to create them. This sent all kinds of bullshit alarms blaring for me, although I couldn't see why a guy who was previously slating climate change denialists would be lying about solar panels straight after.

One point he made - which kinda stumped me - was that if renewables were effective enough to power the planet, big businesses would already have pursued that area (put loads of solar panels in the Sahara desert, loads of turbines in the North Sea). I didn't know nearly enough about energy companies to offer anything to this question. In fact, for all I know, 'Big Energy' might be fully pursuing this avenue of power-generation - although it seemed a big like an 'argument from unimagination' to me: ""Can you think of another reason why x might not be happening? No? Well, my reason is correct then.""

Besides, I could think of other reasons. Maybe renewable energy generation is still quite a developing field, so companies figure they should wait until the best possible solar panels have been made, before covering areas the size of cities in them. Maybe batteries can't store enough energy to compensate for days without much sun or wind.

Anyway, this all made me want a bit of schooling from some less obnoxious individuals. So, if it's alright, I have 3 questions that came out of this conversation:

1. Can we meet the current energy demands of the human race through renewables alone? (Ignore factors like how we can't build batteries good enough to power planes, etc.)

2. Do solar panels really not generate enough energy to compensate for the fossil fuels required to create them?

3. If renewables are so good, why haven't Big Energy companies taken full advantage of them? I mean, wouldn't they be more profitable than oil and gas?

For the record, I have read around the subject quite a lot, but I couldn't find articles particular enough to fit these questions. I hope you don't mind my asking here. Writing this question took about 40 minutes, so it's not like I couldn't be bothered to google it.","2015-10-15 11:23:55","4","4","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3ouf0g/can_we_power_the_world_through_renewables_alone/","True","Zetland","1747868712.9751935","CO2 is good","manual"
"3pxbv9","environment","emotional","The average human could erase their lifetime carbon footprint by planting just 2 trees a year for life. [r/theydidthemath]","Originally posted on r/theydidthemath.
  
Some simple Math.  Figure one!  [The average human lifespan in the USA is 78.74 years] (https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=average%20human%20lifespan%20usa). 
  
Figure 2!  In that lifetime, The average human's carbon footprint is about [4 tons per year.](http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/150926/).
  
Figure 3!!  A tree can sequester [1 ton of CO2 per 40 years](http://www.americanforests.org/discover-forests/tree-facts/).
  
So simple.  Let's round that lifespan up to 80 for simplicity's sake.  Now we see in 80 years, planting 1 tree covers 2 tons.  If you plant 2 trees, in 80 years, that's 4 tons.  That's one year of carbon emissions covered for every two trees planted.  :D
  
Therefore, you realize, if you plant 2 trees a year for life, each of those two trees will remove your carbon footprint for that year totally from the Earth.  It will take 80 years for each pair of trees to do it, of course, but each of us could do much better than two trees a year.
  
All of this to say that if each of us made it our goal to erase our own footprint in this ultra simple way, instead of preaching to companies or getting frustrated with people who don't recycle, what a world it would be, right?  You don't even have to change your life!  Stop driving your car, even stop pumping the heat in the winter time... as long as *you're* responsible for *your* carbon footprint being erased, you have had zero impact on global warming.  It doesn't do us any good to wail and worry and yell at the government to do something.  Right here, right now, each of us can do something, just by planting *2 trees a year.*  More than something, we can be utterly responsible for *us.*  We can lead by example.
  
No one can tell big companies what to do, it's painfully obvious we're going to have to do this ourselves - no company cares about anything but $$$.  So let's do it ourselves.  Let's start planting trees.  If this post ends up going anywhere, I'll start a kickstarter to do just that.  I'll call it... 160 trees.  That's your lifetime goal.  Just like doing your taxes each year, each of us should plant two trees.  Hell, plant four, and make up for another loved one of yours.  Plant 6 and cover that one climate change denier at your work, now his attitude doesn't even matter anymore - his footprint is gone, thanks to you!  It *is that simple.*","2015-10-23 16:44:35","2","4","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3pxbv9/the_average_human_could_erase_their_lifetime/","True","Justice_Man","1747868715.9004743","CO2 is good","manual"
