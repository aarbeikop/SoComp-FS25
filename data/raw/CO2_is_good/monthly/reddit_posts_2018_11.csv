"9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","What They Never Explained...","What people who insist that climate change is threatening enough to warrant aggressive policy changes have never sufficiently explained, is why it would be plausible that a belief that happens to precisely fit their emotional needs also happens to be true. Climate change alarmism looks and feels exactly like half a dozen former environmental scares, that all turned out to be wrong. So we can conclude, that many people have an emotional need to believe in such scares, and that such beliefs are exceptionally plausible to them. If we find a belief that many people strongly crave, the most likely explanation is that they believe it because they like the belief, not because it is true. That reality should oblige the emotional needs of the early 21st century green person is highly unlikely. It rather seems that global warming is a psychologism. A certain portion of the population simply wakes up with a sensation that doom is imminent, and then they come up with reasons for why this feeling is justified. The one common thread of the green era was that the world was always supposed to be ending, it was always urgent and hysterical, they just now and then changed the reason of why exactly it is ending. All these environmental scares are structurally replaceable, and seem to run the same emotional habit. The plausible explanation of these observations is not that greens must be right about the last reason they propose, but that they have some internal reason for believing in immanent doom, and then find rationalizations for it. Even traditional religion is functionally the same belief system and has been found to run on the same cognitive hardware as environmental beliefs. Warmists certainly behave like religionists, it is very important to them that everyone accepts their belief. Climate change has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations, always changing the story under the same label as old theories get refuted. The ""consensus"" thus does not confirm catastrophic global warming, but can refer to acceptance of any of the many theories with that name. Yet is always taken to confirm the current iteration of catastrophic global warming.

Edit: I'm throwing this out as a challenge. If you want to convert me, then explain it to me. I have heard plenty of the usual hostile talking points, and that's not what I'm looking for. Don't just request me to justify my claims, or nitpick at my arguments, and claim that me not making good enough arguments somehow makes your belief true. This is an opportunity to the believer, to explain to me, the disbeliever, why your belief is plausible.","2018-11-05 12:39:04","0","21","0.3","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9ud5pr/what_they_never_explained/","True","taylor-4","1747905108.683521","CO2 is good","manual"
"9ucixu","climatechange","action-oriented","Stopping the paralysis","From a personal perspective I have long avoided articles and reports about climate change because the terror involved in truly accepting the threat is overwhelming. I assume that many folk feel the same way. So, how can we stop people being terrified into paralysis? Instead of warning and frightening people, we need to empower them to feel capable of making and expecting change. We need a complete, positive and efficient list of possible personal and corporate activities that people can use to help. This will help people understand exactly what they can do to help with the problem, without making them stick their head in the sand. So please, hit me up homies. I need clear instructions that I can give to people when I’m discussing this issue. 

What can we do as individuals? In our workplaces? For instance, I work in a school and I really think I can send the message there, but if I frighten the children they will feel helpless, not strong and capable of improving things. So please, who can we write to? Who can we call? For which charities can we raise funds? How can we help our schools/workplaces to access renewable energy? I’m looking for positive, measurable changes to empower change.

"9zy731","environment","emotional","Climate pessimism is paralyzing and unproductive: A case for optimism and a list of meaningful things you can do","Hi everyone,

Being on Reddit for awhile, I've noticed there are a lot of folks here who are pessimistic about our prospects of dealing with climate change. This is understandable, as very little seems to have been done so far to prevent a total environmental collapse. That being said, I think this pessimism which has served to bring an increased awareness of climate change and its debilitating effects has ironically paralyzed us. Many people on Reddit acknowledge the reality of climate change, but quite a few of them seem to have no idea what they can do about it or, worse, doubt anything they could do would actually matter. Instead, they get stuck on the fact that climate change is happening, assume that humanity is fucked, and accept that there is nothing we can do.

I think viewpoints like these are unproductive. Yes, it is true that humanity could very well be fucked regardless of what we do, but what is the point of wallowing in this thought? Once we have accepted the reality of climate change, thoughts like this do nothing more than promote inaction. I mean, if we truly believe there is nothing we can do or that our individual contributions do not matter, then what beside inaction would we strive to do? In the best case, it is simply an excuse to not do anything because we believe that no one else is doing anything.

This is why I believe we need optimism. And I'm not talking about the brand of optimism that involves sitting around hoping things will get better. I'm talking about accepting reality and pushing forward anyways. Yes, our individual contributions actually do matter. It might be a drop in an ocean, but an ocean is nothing more than a collection of drops. The more people who push for sustainable lifestyles, who pressure their governments to care, who are role models for the others in their lives, the better chance we have to create a better future.

You have probably all heard about going vegetarian or riding a bike to work, so here are some less common things (or easier variants of common things) I do to help in the fight against climate change:

* I hold meatless monday potlucks at work once every month. 14 people eating one meatless meal is like me not eating meat for an entire week! (I never eat meat with breakfast, so I guess it'd be 21 if you're a fan of bacon)
* I cook only vegetarian at home, but I eat meat at restaurants. This is especially good if you're a bit stingy with money, like myself, or don't want to drop meat completely.
* I call my senators and representatives monthly to let them know about important climate issues.
* I donate to and volunteer with local environmental efforts, where the results feel more tangible to me than on the national scale.
* I do web searches with [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/), who use profits to plant trees.
* I try to buy locally and plan my meals around what grows in my state.
* I use LED light bulbs. They're super cheap these days!
* I buy used and refurbished furniture and reupholster it myself if necessary.

I sincerely believe that we can do this. And even if we can't, but we have tried our best, we will have shown that not all of humanity succumbed to greed in the end.","2018-11-24 12:45:33","4","13","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/9zy731/climate_pessimism_is_paralyzing_and_unproductive/","True","wekele0","1747905293.1177697","CO2 is good","manual"

Five days ago, u/systemrename posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9s4vl1/94_signatories_it_is_unconscionable_to_us_that/) open letter from the Guardian in this sub. It plugs an activism movement called Extinction Rebellion which seems to be fully aware of and open about the danger of catastrophic climate change. The movement officially began on Halloween and since then has gained a lot of traffic on their blog page, which I think makes a good read for collapsers.

Since they hope to have global protests happening in spring 2019, and the subscriber count on r/collapse has grown so much recently, I thought this was a good place to promote it and hopefully reach some other collapse-aware activists.

[From the website:](https://extinctionrebellion.org/)

>*#XR / #ExtinctionRebellion is an international movement using mass civil disobedience to force governments to enter* ***WWII-level mobilisation mode, in response to climate breakdown and ecological crisis***. *We begin on* *31/10/18*, *with a Declaration of Rebellion*. *Join us!* *Based on the science, we have* ***ten years at the most to reduce CO2 emissions to zero***, *or the human race and most other species are at* ***high risk of extinction within decade****.*

Bolding is mine; I wanted to highlight just how aware this movement is of the limitations and the worst-case scenarios.

&#x200B;

If anyone else out there wants to avoid going extinct too (or just enjoys some good old fashioned civil disobedience) - plug this to your friends, family, coworkers, anyone you think would be receptive to it. I know I'm sure as hell going to be protesting this spring.

"a0x66h","collapse","skeptical","all this talk about how it’s not the governments fault global warming is acellerating and people need to make better individual choices and/or decrease the population is wrong.","the government has the money and power to completely transform our energy system. the technology is there and it can be done. we could all be driving electric/hydrogen cars right now if our government subsidized it. we could be flying electric plane engines.  all of this electric energy can be supplied through renewable and fusion tech.

it doesn’t happen because most of our politicians are paid off by fossil fuels.

so just remember that before you blame the population at large.

it can be fixed , but our governments choose not to for short term profit.
