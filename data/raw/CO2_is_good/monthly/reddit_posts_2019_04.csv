"b9j831","climatechange","action-oriented","Questions, What-ifs, And what is policy?","Global Warming.

At some point the icecaps will melt, the oceans will acidify, and the spreading desert will claim all of the eco-systems on earth. To this effect many recent debates have centered on the idea of Carbon Sequestration, removing ton after ton of carbon dioxide from our atmosphere; essentially undoing the damage done.

A recent article caught my eye. At 415 PPM Co2, these levels have not been seen for ~3 million years. But at that point in time there was, in fact, a natural amount of that element in the air.

So in out what-if scenario, if instead we were talking about ""Global Cooling"" - impending ice ages, ocean icecube events, catastrophic glacial formations destroying every eco-system on earth.... What would the policy be?

And the question; aside from anthropological generation, the effects of which are turning out to be quite impactful, if the natural swing of Earth's  climate were to trend toward and unstable or unlivable balance, is it truly appropriate for Humanity to be engaging in geo-engineering?

If we go too far in sequestering Co2 and potentially other greenhouse gasses at what point would it be decided ""alright this is stable. we are good with these conditions.""? Are we trying to start a new ice age and bring back the glaciers? What is the desired end goal of these types of policies?","2019-04-04 22:20:12","1","3","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/b9j831/questions_whatifs_and_what_is_policy/","True","Saint_Ferret","1747909450.0536058","CO2 is good","manual"

I am struggling to find good literature that specifically links CO2 and/or CH4 emissions with climate change. I'm not looking for websites, videos or documentaries. I'm trying to find a few good studies where it's somewhat clear that humans are causing climate change. 

He agrees that climate change is happening, but believes we may be overstating the impact of humans.

"bgrp7a","climate","scientific","Corporations have too much impunity when it comes to their environmental impact","In the Storyville Age of Stupid it showed an oil company in Nigeria burning the natural gas that is released during drilling. This is common practice apparently but what is shocking to me if that the carbon dioxide released and the effect on the climate is enormous. 

On Wikipedia it states that in 2011 this gas flaring was equivalent to a quarter of the gas consumption of the USA and worth $30 billion.

It is also more than half of the CO2 reductions agreed in the Kyoto agreement.

It seems like an easy win to stop this kind of activity. But if governments are unwilling to tackle large corporations, how can people?

"bgwokg","climate","scientific","Independent Green Authority Idea : thoughts welcome!","Hey guys, I was thinking about how a Government could credibly deliver CO2 emission reductions. Part of the problem now is that politicians in democracies have electoral incentives not to take drastic climate action, because it risks affecting the cost of living -> affects electoral chances, so I was thinking about the idea of an independent green authority (a bit like a central bank).

&#x200B;

The idea would be an independent green authority (IGA) would have control over carbon based fiscal instruments such as a carbon tax. The IGA would have a target - again a bit like an inflation target for a central bank - to reduce CO2 emissions each year. They would make a quarterly decision to change the carbon tax rate based on whether the current trends of emissions were on target or not.

&#x200B;

This achieves two things:

\- Carbon is priced to take account of third-party effects, encouraging substitution to less carbon intensive goods and services, as well as an overall income effect on carbon usage.

\- The price of carbon is not affected by political considerations/cycles, and is instead set by an independent body which is solely mandated (i.e. incentivised) to achieve a CO2 emissions reduction target.

&#x200B;

Thoughts very welcome!","2019-04-24 16:26:14","3","0","0.72","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bgwokg/independent_green_authority_idea_thoughts_welcome/","True","rosstaylor90","1747909539.0533023","CO2 is good","manual"
"b81rix","environment","emotional","Disproving the “global warming hoax”","So, my very scientifically minded grandfather (engineer) and I have been having a lot of discussions about greenhouse gasses, specifically CO2. I’ve mentioned choral bleaching, and the other greenhouse gasses that we should be genuinely concerned about (methane, water vapor, etc.), but he likes to keep fixating on the idea that CO2 is not bad for the environment ([video he showed me for reference])(https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fA5sGtj7QKQ), and that it’s all one big hoax. I did some research on the internet, but couldn’t find recent good research on HISTORIC global temperature changes.  On a fundamental level, I know climate change is an issue, and all the real world impacts, but it’s hard to impress the urgency of the situation when he doesn’t believe in the problem to begin with.  If one of you, noble environmentalists, who has a good understanding of the scientific resources that exist on the subject would be willing to share, I would greatly appreciate it!  Or if you just want to rant about the downstream effects, this is a really important topic to me, and getting an opportunity to bring another into the fold is really meaningful to me!

"bhz4be","environment","emotional","Question: Precise information on how to reduce carbon footprint? And why are a few companies said to have a disproportionate big influence?","This is a two-fold question:

1. I am looking for food and precise information on how to reduce my personal carbon footprint. I've looked at a few carbon footprint calculators. Most of them seem to be assuming you live in the US, with the associated life style. Many promote ""carbon compensation""  schemes for plane travel which I think can't work, as we simply can't plant so many billions of trees to compensate for extraction of  carbon that was deposited and fossilized over hundred of millions of years. And quite a few also seem to be data-gathering devices which is suspicious at best (asking for email, zip code, income and so on). However I found the carbon footprint calculator from the German Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency), which looks quite good: https://uba.co2-rechner.de/de_DE/ . It turns out that in my personal case, I seem to be able to reduce my footprint by 30% by just stopping flying. That's very helpful. But I feel I need more precise and better information, for example on consumer articles, clothing and so on.

2. Some climate activists say that very few large corporations cause the bulk of global emissions. Is this true?

"b7w5nv","collapse","skeptical","How ""social justice"" ensures the continue neglect of the sustainability crisis","This case has been doing the rounds this week, [see for example here](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2019/03/26/a-guide-to-wokespeak-the-notorious-amherst-common-language-guide/). 

And here is the whole thing:

[Amherst College Common Language Guide](https://www.scribd.com/document/402959759/Amherst-College-Common-Language-Guide)

Now it does have the usual social justice speech policing, but unlike most other such documents, it also contains this gem:

>MYTH OF SCARCITY
> Used to pit people against each other, this is the fostering of the belief that resources are limited and the blaming of members of the marginalized group for using up too much of the limited resources available

Which is the most explicit statement of something I have been worried about for a long time. 

The problem is the following. Fundamental to social justice ideology is an outright denial of the scientific worldview. From postmodernist and feminist epistemology, to the specifics of individual scientific disciplines, biology being the most important among them (first it was a denial of the reality of human sexual dimorphism, then it moved to outright denial of the binary nature of sex in humans). 

It was always quite obvious that such attitudes will not be conductive to addressing the sustainability crisis, for you cannot address the sustainability crisis if you do not understand it, and you cannot understand it unless you view humans for what they are, i.e. Darwinian machines, and you also cannot understand it unless you see the world around you as being physical in nature and ruled by the remorseless laws of physics rather than being political in nature as most people do. 

And the philosophy underpinning social justice ideology is fundamentally opposed to that worldview.

There are also the specifics -- the sustainability crisis cannot be dealt with unless global population is reduced by an order of magnitude within the next century and unless we transition to a steady-state economy starting right now. But how are people who are ""triggered"" by ordinary words, who go into hysteria at the slightest unpleasant sight, and who need special ""safe space"" rooms with puppies and play-doh to calm their nerves if someone who disagrees with them happens to be nearby, going to ever even consider the thought of population reduction (and all the attendant unpleasant inconveniences such as forced abortions, sterilizations, etc.)? It's not going to happen. 

Those same people also see the responsibility for all wrongs in the world falling entirely on the shoulders of what constitutes 1/10th of its population even though most of the environmental damage and resource depletion that is going to finally push humanity past the precipice in the coming decades is going to be done by the other 90%. 

All of this was quite clear a long time ago. 

But now I saw this explicit statement of brutal denial of objective reality, and I thought it is a good time for a more serious discussion on the topic.

"bbqorr","collapse","skeptical","Question on Quora: How likely is human extinction by 2026, as Guy McPherson and Arctic News Blog estimate (due to methane, CO2, etc.)? My Answer...","I recently interviewed a scientist about humanity’s survival prospects and they don’t look good. You can read the full interview here:

[Concerning Humanity’s Future: Interview with Nick Humphrey, Climatologist and Geoscientist](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/4/5/1848063/-Concerning-Humanity-s-Future-Interview-with-Nick-Humphrey-Climatologist-and-Geoscientist)

“At 500 parts per million of equivalent carbon dioxide concentration, enough greenhouse gases are currently in the atmosphere to ultimately warm the planet 4-5 degrees C/7-9 F above 1700s temperatures, raise the sea level by 220 feet/67 meters (assuming 1 ppm CO2 equivalent = 1 ft sea level rise, based on past longer-term paleoclimate change response), remove significant amounts of soil moisture, leading to the destruction of agriculture. And this is without any other carbon releases or feedbacks…”

So we are looking at 4–5C warming even if we were to somehow magically reduce our annual 40–50 Gigatonnes of CO2 emissions to zero overnight, and this won’t happen because it would crash the global economy. Yes, human extinction is a real possibility and some would say an inevitability. The timing of it may be up to debate, but the threat is definitely increasing. A recent EU report mentions human extinction as a possible outcome:

""An increase of 1.5 degrees is the maximum the planet can tolerate; should temperatures increase further beyond 2030, we will face even more droughts, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people; the likely demise of the most vulnerable populations – **and at worst, the extinction of humankind altogether**."" (page 8-9 of document). [https://espas.secure.europarl.eu...](https://espas.secure.europarl.europa.eu/orbis/sites/default/files/generated/document/en/ESPAS_Report2019.pdf)

How will humans go extinct? An excerpt from Bill McKibben’s new book published in the Rollingstone hints at how this would play out. It all comes down to food and how climate change will disrupt our ability to grow, distribute, and sell it. Science can only help so much, but there are limits and we're hitting them. The costs of maintaining modern civilization’s far-flung and intensive food production system will be overwhelmed by global warming and climate change. Modern man lives a few short meals from anarchy... [This Is How Human Extinction Could Play Out](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/bill-mckibben-falter-climate-change-817310/)

The scale of modern civilization’s environmental problems is really beyond comprehension. We are destroying the base of the food chain on land and in the oceans. This can be seen with reports of plummeting insect numbers and phytoplankton numbers:

[**Plummeting insect numbers 'threaten collapse of nature'**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature)

[**Building blocks of ocean food web in rapid decline as plankton productivity plunges**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/ocean-phytoplankton-zooplankton-food-web-1.4927884)

Humans sit atop the food chain and there is no reason to believe we will avoid the destruction of the biosphere since we are dependent upon its integrity like any other organism. As you may be aware, we are currently undergoing the sixth mass extinction as evidenced by numerous studies showing loss of all kinds of species. Four of the last five mass extinction events were preceded by a disruption of the carbon cycle. When renowned paleoclimatologist Lee Kump was asked whether comparisons to today’s global warming and that of past mass extinctions are really appropriate, he ominously said, “Well, the rate at which we’re injecting CO2 into the atmosphere today, according to our best estimates, is ten times faster than it was during the End-Permian. And rates matter. So today we’re creating a very difficult environment for life to adapt, and we’re imposing that change maybe ten times faster than the worst events in Earth’s history.” Humans are [recreating the past extinction known as The Great Dying](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/global-warming-extinction-report-the-great-dying) at a much faster pace and at many more human-forced levels that leave no ecosystem on Earth intact.","2019-04-10 20:06:48","29","30","0.85","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bbqorr/question_on_quora_how_likely_is_human_extinction/","True","xrm67","1747910029.2384443","CO2 is good","manual"
