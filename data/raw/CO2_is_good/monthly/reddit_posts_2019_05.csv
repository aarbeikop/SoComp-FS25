"bsn2lt","climatechange","action-oriented","How does CO2 causes earth to heat up?","Does anyone have good scientific facts on how CO2 causes global warming?

Air is 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and 0.04% CO2. CO2 has gone from 300 ppm to  415 ppm in last century and could get to  500ppm soon. While this is a huge increase in CO2 it is still a very small fraction of the air.  There is not much difference in 0.04% and 0.05%

For sure CO2 gas is a better insulator than  nitrogen or  oxygen. I believe O and N  have r value of about 0.97 per inch while CO2 is 1.5.  However given the small percentage of CO2 in the air,  i suspect it would not change the overall insulation properties of air.

CO2 can absorb infrared radiation whereas oxygen and nitrogen do not. However, again since CO2 makes up such a small fraction of air, I can't see this making huge change in earth's temperature.

The most interesting theories I have heard relate to how CO2 amplifies the amount of  water vapour that air can hold. Since water vapor and clouds have a huge effect on earths temperature this sounds more plausible. The only way I understand how C02 effects water vapour is that CO2 will warm the air, thus warm air holds more moisture. Again we are back to the small percentage of CO2 and could that small percentage have a large impact on the airs moisture content. Maybe there are other interactions at play.

Does anyone have additional info that could help clarify?","2019-05-24 22:13:08","6","23","0.8","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bsn2lt/how_does_co2_causes_earth_to_heat_up/","True","swarren_ca","1747910240.8996665","CO2 is good","manual"
"bjr7yb","climatechange","action-oriented","Climate science most conclusive experiments","Hi, I’m trying to convince a stubborn uncle that climate change is real. He has a scientific orientation, so I thought I’d hit him with that angle. 

Where can I find a good list of conclusive experimental results on the science of greenhouse theory, climate change theory and the like?

His assertion is that climate science is only based on computer model interpretation, not experiments or tests. 

Help me prove him wrong!","2019-05-02 05:17:24","10","13","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bjr7yb/climate_science_most_conclusive_experiments/","True","jefemundo","1747910261.3991268","CO2 is good","manual"
"bpaimb","climatechange","action-oriented","It's not about altruistic behaviour, it's about saving our own ass","First, I'm not a native speaker so sorry for all grammar mistakes. 

My point is very simple. I have a really rational view about climate change prevention. We prevent the human kind from suffering and chaos. Food production may go dramatically down and we aren't feeding all people by the level of production today. So we will have problems of satisfying the basic needs of us all. Secondly the weather will become crazy and dangerous. The impact is not only that one million specious die. It's not altruistic it's just the logic and nessasary to lower the co2 (and other gas emissions) level on earth. I hate the spirit of saving the planet is some kind of a hippie idea, like think about the animals. Well this is a good reason too, no question, but it will affect us all in a really dramatical way. I hope the majority of our communities will get this point.","2019-05-16 09:43:42","12","2","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bpaimb/its_not_about_altruistic_behaviour_its_about/","True","derLinuss","1747910290.980234","CO2 is good","manual"
"bpcpel","climate","scientific","Let's discuss facts, help out the open minded like me.","When Trump was elected president, like most Europeans I was pretty upset. He called global warming a hoax, and I learned that stuff in high school. Everyone knows it is real, how can one take him seriously? Or so I thought. But after studying a bit more, I am not sure how to reconcile these observations:

1) The current CO2 ppm are at around 400. Below 250, plants start to suffer significantly. CO2 is crucial to life.

2) 400 million years ago, CO2 ppm were over 6000. Back then, the Earth was full of life already.

3) It is hard to find good data on CO2 volatility in ppm, but it appears to fluctuate over time a fair amount.

4) Water vapor is more impactful as a greenhouse gas than CO2. And most people would prefer the stable temperatures of a sea climate (much water vapor) to inland desert climate (little water vapor). The desert climate simply fluctuates too much for people. So it seems that CO2 also has this stabilizing effect. 

5) Ice ages are manifested when the sun is relatively inactive. When the sun gets more active, the Earth, as well as other planets in vicinity, heat up. This component has a lot more impact than on the temperature than any greenhouse gas. Which is kind of obvious actually, since virtually all warmth on the surface of Earth comes from the sun.

These observations definitely seem to impact my thinking. If you can comment on any of these points, please stay with facts and reliable sources rather than plain conclusions. It would be nice if this thread could stay clean and professional. Help with figuring this out would be much appreciated :)","2019-05-16 13:42:40","0","13","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bpcpel/lets_discuss_facts_help_out_the_open_minded_like/","True","Crimson_Fire_Apples","1747910341.9578826","CO2 is good","manual"
"brisxe","environment","emotional","We need to stop global warming","And we need to start now. If we don't start now we will lose our Earth and most likely die within 30 years .Cut down on fossil fuels. Plant a tree because they suck up Co2 . Vote people who support extinction out of office like Trump . Register to vote , it is important . Ride a hybrid or electric car. Go vegan or if you're not comfortable with that have one or 2 vegan days a week. Help people gain awareness . Be  helpful to the environment and the future of the human race. It's not to hard. Take half an hour to plant a tree , probably less , make your next car an electric or hybrid. Ride your bike to places that are close. And encourage people to do the same. Up vote or comment to get this to the front page so more people can see.

"bkfqga","collapse","skeptical","What to do now? Advice needed...","I've always been really clear that I'm not going to have children.EVER.

A week ago my boyfriend of the past 8 years suddenly decided he wants to have some and broke up with me.

I'm devastated, this relationship was the last nice thing in my world.

I tried everything to make it work, and it still wasn't enough, and the thoughts of this being the best possible outcome of any relationship for me, are in my mind.

&#x200B;

As I have to move out, I've quit my unsatisfactory IT job this week.

&#x200B;

Friends exhaust me. Either they fill your mind with their own problems, or want to gain other advantages... Truthfully I'm not getting anything in return, so why should I bother?

&#x200B;

People in general annoy me (if not worse), the mindless pursuit of wealth and personal gain is disgusting, most behave like brainwashed zombies.

&#x200B;

I've been working a lot, not getting much in return, and spend most on our shared (lost) future. So in the end I have to ask myself, why should I enslave myself to the system, if return is little to nothing?

It's not as if I will ever get pensions, when I grow old, or as if my taxes get used in a sensible manner, like maintaining infrastructure.

&#x200B;

I'm worried what the world will turn into, food shortages, heat waves and such and personally I think adopting a migratory lifestyle might be best.

&#x200B;

I have that crazy idea of getting myself a sailboat, fixing her up (and make my life more sustainable, have less of a co2-footprint, solar, wind and such) and living there, and if the world becomes unbearable, I could simply take off.

As I don't have anything left to loose right now, I might as well try.

Of course I'm worried about several aspects of this idea (like being sick on a boat alone w/o heath care, getting enough freelance jobs).

&#x200B;

My problem is, I have a tiny budget, and not much energy left to socialize, no friends, pretty depressed anyway.

How could I make this a reality. Where could I find like-minded people?

Scavenging scrapyards is on my list, but still I'll come up short.

&#x200B;

"bpxvtp","collapse","skeptical","Shitpost Friday: Who works in STEM and hears endless babble about the future?","Grumble:I work in drug R&D, finishing my doctorate soon. Everyone that knows this feels obligated to talk to me about the future solutions of our technology. My family has repeatedly told me how I am entering this field at 'the right time' because they think it will be booming for the next 50 years. I am glad they think I made a good decision and all (and it is nice to not hear weekly questions of ""*what do you actually do*?"" as when I was working in anthropology), but the truth is, medicine isn't going to last if ecology fails, and it is failing. Medicine today requires fossil fuels at almost every level of production, and even more-so during development.

I am so miserable because I know some of the smartest people on the planet, and I know human intelligence and potential is incredible, and yet, I also know that our system is going to cause a collapse before we can ever solve humanity's greatest problems. I have so much cognitive dissonance knowing that I am trying to save lives, but acknowledging that a major problem is our population overshoot.How do you respond to the daily 'hopium' in your industry?
