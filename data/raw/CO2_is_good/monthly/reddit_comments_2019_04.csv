1. You can't really show pictures of climate change. Climate is the average of weather over decades. Every picture you want to show is a picture of a weather event. Every class of weather event happened well before we dance-clubbing primates figured out how to burn coal or distill petroleum. It's a rookie move that makes you look like a propagandist.

2. Your disdain for your classmates, if not already known, will be readily apparent in your presentation. As soon as it is, nothing you say or do will be taken seriously by your classmates. The world already has plenty of misanthropic climate activists. What would really be refreshing would be a person who genuinely cared for their audience.

For what it's worth, I live in Utah. I am ex-Mormon and have little in common with my neighbors. I still wouldn't take the approach you are proposing.","2019-04-16 03:13:00","2","Will_Power","1747909445.5456812","CO2 is good","manual"

It would depend somewhat on what was causing it. If it were something we were doing, we could, you know, stop doing that. If it were a natural gradual slide towards glaciation the simplest geoengineering method would be to release some greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Are we trying to start a new ice age and bring back the glaciers? What is the desired end goal of these types of policies? 

This is getting to some of the key issues with geoengineering. People have talked about costs, but those are generally relatively small. People have talked about possible side effects but I can't really see why any side effects would be more harmful than allowing the warming to continue unimpeded (and the modelling evidence seems to back that view). For me the real issue with geoengineering is that it just isn't politically feasible. As you're hinting, what would be required for a geoengineering policy would be an international body to manage it, probably under the auspices of the UN, and a target climate agreed by all the countries of the world where we want to hold the planet at *forever*. I just can't see that happening in the current or foreseeable future political climate, particularly with the growing nationalist and anti-globalist fervor. If nothing else, the reaction by the ""new world order"" peeps would be wild.

On the other hand, at some point in the deep future we'll probably need to set up something like that body to control climate, so maybe, somehow, now is the time.","2019-04-05 18:04:32","3","skeeezoid","1747909450.2668445","CO2 is good","manual"

You need to read more science and less fiction.

&#x200B;

> if instead we were talking about ""Global Cooling"".... What would the policy be?

&#x200B;

1. Fly over glaciers spreading black dust of some sort. Coal dust would be fine. 
2. Seed the right sort of clouds. (There are different forcing changes depending on where clouds form.)
3. Start cranking out heavy duty GHGs, particularly sulfur hexaflouride. 
4. Do a little radiation management from orbit. Very thin aluminum sheets make great mirrors to give the planet a little extra radiation in a few key places.

&#x200B;

>...is it truly appropriate for Humanity to be engaging in geo-engineering?

&#x200B;

Absolutely. Humans weren't the only species to face near-extinction during the last glacial period. 

&#x200B;

>If we go too far in sequestering Co2 and potentially other greenhouse gasses at what point would it be decided ""alright this is stable. we are good with these conditions.""? 

&#x200B;

It would be a good idea to get CO2 to plateau at some level and observe temperatures for a decade or two before deciding to bring them back down. In other words, the level they are at when the mitigation effort begins would be a good place to maintain for a little while. 

&#x200B;

No. That would be dumb. Animal and plant life would suffer huge losses, not to mention people.

Well, this is a little misleading - because there *are* other factors, and those other factors are larger than human output.  But that doesn't change what we need to do.

Specifically, human output is something like 2% to 4% (I forget the exact figure and it's changed over the years) of global CO\^2 output.  So we're a tiny fraction of the total.  Most of it comes from other things - animals, volcanoes, natural processes, etc.

The problem is that the natural CO\^2 uptake picks up about *half* of that extra amount we produce (via plants, ocean acidification, etc. and this number has been pretty consistent)  So if  human output is 4% of the CO\^2 release, and the total is therefore 104% of the background amount, the uptake by the environment is about 102% of the background rate.

Meaning that 2% of the total rate, or about half of what humans produce, stays in the atmosphere and contributes to greenhouse warming.

Now you can say it's 98% ""other causes.""  And you'd be technically right.  But what good does that do you?  We've still dumped a huge amount of CO\^2 into the atmosphere that wasn't taken back up.  And yet if we stabilize and reduce our CO\^2 output, we can eliminate that 2% rise completely, and *not* contribute to greenhouse warming.  Which means it is in our power to change.

And isn't that all we need to know?  If it has bad consequences, and it's in our power to stop, it becomes a pretty simple question, doesn't it?  We don't need to know if we're to blame (because our CO\^2 output is double the amount of the increase), or inanimate volcanoes are to ""blame"" (because they are a larger part of the total) - we need to know how big the problem is and how to fix it.  And we've got a pretty clear picture on that.

Anything else is just politicizing the blame game while the house burns down around us.","2019-04-12 01:38:02","2","TheFeshy","1747909514.3997962","CO2 is good","manual"
"ekp8y9x","t3_bc4a8k","bc4a8k","climate","scientific","It starts with the basic physics of it. CO2 and other \[greenhouse gases\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse\_gas) close a frequency gap in the infrared light spectrum. Light comes down from the sky at about 1000 W/m², warms the ground, the ground starts to radiate the heat away in a different, non visible light spectrum.

Greenhouse gases close that specific gap so the heat can no longer escape. This is a relatively small change that leads to big accumulation of heat. 

This can be verified using relatively simple experiments. Measure CO2 in athmosphere and measure how it absorbs more light in that spectrum. 

If your eyes could see other colors in the infrared spectrum, you would see how greenhouse gases are tinting our atmosphere. Tinted glas in the path of a light sources will heat up more than clear glas.

Now you have a ton of other factors that could influence climate change and deniers love to trot out the ""yeah but what about...? Gotcha!"". But scientists have accounted for all these factors and ruled them out by using very complex models and computer simulations. But that is where it gets complicated. At this point you either have to replicate and disprove the scientific studies or accept this. That is how science works, repeating the same experiments over and over to see if you get different results. So do that or ""shut up"".

Our world is a finely optimized machine and any imbalance will lead to catastrophic effects and conflict. The problem isn't that we couldn't live on a planet that is 4°C hotter, it's that we evolved and build our society around a specific set of circumstances. We optimized our profit margins around things working just so. We live in a fragile and unstable global society.

We will have all the crop seeds and plants, domestic animals etc, we can grow crops even on the Moon, using aeroponics and hydroponics. I do not find a prediction of extinction in any reputable science source.

There is a lot of research however into climate resilience. Even in the last ice age with neolithic hunter gatherers, there was a lot of climate resilience as the temperatures fluctuated widly far more than they do today. With the very worst case of a maybe 12 °C rise sometime after 2100 at ""Business as usual"" which we are not on, then maybe we have coconuts grow in the Mediterranian and mangoes in Paris, who knows. But that is not remotely an uninhabitable world for humans.

 Sam Carana's blog is absurd.  He uses QUADRATICS to EXTRAPOLATE. A quadratic, as you may remember from school, always trends to infinity in both directions, unless that is it ascends from absolute zero and descends back to absolute zero in the future (and below). His ""projections"" do the same but he doesn't include the left side of them where they descend from infinity which would show up their absurdity.

See my  [Absurd Blog Post At Arctic News Predicts 10 °C Rise In Global Temperatures By 2026 - QUADRATIC To EXTRAPOLATE!](https://www.science20.com/print/237501)

His blog seems to have an impressive list of contributors until you click through and discover that he credits every professor in every video he embeds in his blog using the YouTube embedding license! This does not mean they support or endorse his blog or even know about it!

Guy McPHerson uses ""Sam Carana""'s posts as a source for his predictions. 'nuf said!

We are not yet in the middle of a mass extinction, just the beginning. And an unusual one if it is. All our garden plants, crops, domestic animals, they are not at risk of extinction. In principle, we could keep them also on the Moon! And we are doing much to preserve species. The biologist Chris Thomas says that this is much like the way that species are lost when continents merge during continental drift. We start with an unusually diverse world with climates ranging all the way from the Kalahari to Antarctica, and also, multiple diverse ecosystems in the same climate, in Africa, India, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, numerous smaller islands, all having their own indigenous species in the same niches.

The main thing happening at present is that some of those ecosystems are merging, the result is more diverse, but individual species get lost.

See my [Debunked that we are in the middle of a sixth mass extinction](https://debunkingdoomsday.quora.com/Debunked-that-we-are-in-the-middle-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction).

The only complete ecosystem we risk losing at 2 C are the corals. That will lead to mass migration, millions of people depend on them, but not to collapse of civilization.

There is plenty of need for urgent action but you don't need to be scared of loss of civilization. And a lot is being done. We have already knocked a full degree of the projected temperature rise by 2100, and we have to knock another 1.5 degrees off to save the corals. This is something we can definitely do.
