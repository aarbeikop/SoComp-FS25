"cp5p4rw","t3_2y1j81","2y1j81","climatechange","action-oriented","There are certain things that are quantifiable:

- temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces, and the deep ocean.

- sea ice extent and volume.

- land ice (including glacier) melt.

- extreme weather event frequency and severity.

- sea level rise.

Model projections have been pretty good on some of these, pretty poor on others.  Temperatures have been well below the projected mean for both surface and most of the atmosphere.  There were few projections of ocean temperatures, so there's not much to compare.  If the present ""hiatus,"" as scientists use the term, persist for another 5 to 10 years, then temperatures will be outside the confidence interval of GCMs (General Circulation Models).

Arctic sea ice volume has decreased pretty significantly, so models have that one right.  Arctic ice extent has been in general decline since the 1970s, though I couldn't say that I know of models focused on extent rather than volume.  Antarctic sea ice volume and extent has increased, which was not expected by modellers.

I have not seen model projections for land ice.  They may be out there somewhere, but I am not aware of them.  Greenland is experiencing decline, as is the West Antarctic peninsula.  Himalayan glaciers have remained pretty static.

The IPCC SREX reported that there is very little evidence of increases in extreme weather events, either in frequency or severity.  John Holdren might want to read that sometime.

Sea level rise is at the top of projections from the early 90s, but seems not to have accelerated in recent years.  Previous projections were based primarily on land ice melt and thermal expansion.  The X factor is one is that has received some attention in the literature in recent years: terrestrial aquifer depletion.  So two of the three components of SLR are associated with climate change, one is not.

I think the heart of your questions is whether climate models, specifically GCMs, are worthwhile, or perhaps whether we put too much emphasis on them.  In my opinion, we do.  There is just too much parameterization going on for my comfort level.  I think it is unfortunate that so much stock was put in them to start with.  The climate is an incredibly complex, chaotic system and the amount of computing power to make real sense of it in terms of projections would require more computing power than our species could realistically build.  I think a much better approach to the whole subject would have been to focus on simple models and more data collection, including more instrumentation.

"cp5dthy","t3_2y1j81","2y1j81","climatechange","action-oriented",">Are there objective quantifiable points that were used to determine the success/failure of the current climate models?

No

> is every predicted change occurring? Are all of the weather changes we've seen part of predicted models? 

The models have effectively predicted both sides of all events for decades.  Thus unfalsifiable from the perspective of science.  Case in point, the Pause,  Which was predicted with extremely low confidence in some models. The true believers now pretend that the models that predicted the pause validate the dozens of others that did not.

>can be intellectually honest when we attribute things to its influence? 

No.  The models are essentially a hypothesis/predictions.  To put any empirical weight to the conclusion of the models is akin to taking a prediction as empirical proof, an obvious anti-scientific situation.  

The only things we can say for certain.  

- Co2 is a more effective emitter and absorber of IR.  

- Co2 has dramatically increased the growth rate of plants via carbon fertilization. 

- Humans have had some non zero effect on the climate.(but its not proven if its stronger then natural variability)

That's it.  The temps can not be definitively nailed to Co2, and that theory is looking less likely by the day as the pause continues, despite an RPC 8.5 emission scenario, or higher.  Somewhere around half of all human emissions have taken place since the pause started, thus natural variability has to be stronger or nearly equal to our Co2 forcing.  

>At what point (if any) do we say - ""we need to reevaluate our models""?

The skeptics have been asking this for years, with no answer from those who say the ""science is settled"".","2015-03-05 18:25:13","-3","FireFoxG","1747861740.0697055","CO2 is good","manual"

The fact is that we're just animals who evolved to fit an environment which we no longer live in. When we over-exploit resources, we're simply following a million years of instincts that kept our ancestors alive and breeding.

It's impossible or wrong to blame a toddler who gets hold of a handgun for shooting up the house. In the same way, we may be the authors of our own destruction, but it was both inevitable and the result of a natural process, our own evolution.

The only way that this could have been avoided is either meddling with our genetic structure to edit out harmful instincts, or put us under the direct control of something without those instincts. ","2015-03-28 20:43:24","18","stumo","1747862699.3812819","CO2 is good","manual"

Internet service was down for the last four days so I was doing some reading, “Mapping the Mind” by Rita Carter. I found this passage on p.42 to be in agreement with our conclusions: 

>“Our urge to rationalize behavior probably has considerable survival value. The human species got where it is largely by forming complex social constructs – from the hunting party to the political party – and making them work. To work they require that we have confidence in them and to have confidence we need to believe that the actions of these organizations are based on sound, rational judgements. At one level, of course, we know we are kidding ourselves. For example, all governments, in all societies, have some policies that are demonstrably irrational. However, no government member, anywhere, ever admits this – not at the time, anyway. Instead they rationalize their policy-making. We may see through it, but basically we like things this way – it makes us feel safe.”

So basically what we have is a subconsciously directed Homo erectus fossil fuel hunting party with the added capabilities of technology, without willfulness, with a wordsmithing module that tells us we’re doing the right thing and that God loves capitalism, F-150 trucks, war heroes, Coca-Cola, that humans are special, growth is good and that the technological singularity is just beyond the horizon.

Thus, the Middle East being a clusterfuck is not a good indicator at all of global collapse.
