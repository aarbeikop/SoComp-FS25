"7tqf3k","environment","emotional","Is Travel an environmentally unfriendly move?","Hello. Outside of my brief time in the Navy I have never left the northeastern US directly around the NYC area. I would love nothing more in the world to travel and see Australia and India, but I feel as if Travel is a very environmentally unfriendly activity so I suppose I'll stay put till I die. Does anyone else think people have to stop this mindless travel fetishism that is popular now? It's a useless expense of carbon. Besides, thanks to globalism isn't most of the world is the bloody same anyway just with different accents so why bother? I dunno I just think that environmentalism and endlessly shitting carbon into the atmosphere with needless travel are two diametrically opposed ideologies","2018-01-29 06:22:50","1","7","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/7tqf3k/is_travel_an_environmentally_unfriendly_move/","True","martini29","1747892984.719483","CO2 is good","manual"
"7o4ytg","collapse","skeptical","Know what, maybe it'd be better if modern society completely collapsed","I mean, it truly seems that the alternative to a collapse of society will be authoritarianism as the only system of government. America has spread and enforced its capitalist hellhole throughout the entire world, it's a rot deep in the core of every modern society, maybe the collapse will be good for mankind, a chance to start over. The modern world is a hell, just one with a shiny ribbon on top.","2018-01-04 18:30:53","21","50","0.7","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/7o4ytg/know_what_maybe_itd_be_better_if_modern_society/","True","fuckitidunno","1747893355.6882796","CO2 is good","manual"
"7rb807","collapse","skeptical","I've got a new collapse podcast inspired in large part by all of you on /r/collapse","Hey all, this is not my regular /r/collapse account since the show is tied to my name, but rest assured I've been here for a *very* long time.

A friend and I started a podcast about the many different issues of collapse (climate/environment, government, economic, limited resources/overpopulation, and societal/cultural) taking time each week to explore a specific subject in some depth and maybe begin to understand how all this is interconnected. We're seven episodes in and so far we touch on arctic ice, sea level rise, corporate surveillance, net neutrality, infrastructure collapse, ocean acidification/deoxygenation/warming, and the health effects of CO2 (inspired largely by /u/MrVisible and this sub) with many more episodes recorded or under way (once a week for the foreseeable future).

The goal of the show is to bring these heavily researched, fairly examined issues of collapse to your less, er, ""aware"" friends and family. Long time collapseniks might learn a thing or two along the way, but it's definitely about opening the eyes of the general population of just how much shit is currently or is about to hit the fan. Fair warning, we are critical of capitalism at points, but for the most part political commentary is kept to a minimum and usually only briefly mentioned in a ""what could we do?"" wrap up (which is usually of course ""nothing""). We *fucking hate hopium* so you won't find any of that here (while trying not to get too depressing).

You can find all our shows, links and sources, full transcripts for the hearing impaired, and tons more stuff on our website [ashesashes.org](https://ashesashes.org/). We don't have ads (and never will), we don't ask for donations, we don't track you, and everything is released under creative commons BY-SA.
