"d6ea26z","t3_4xc7c1","4xc7c1","climate","scientific","The only reason you're on this planet is because an unbroken chain of ancestors has been facing the struggle of life.   Which, until very recently, meant much more hardship than most of us would endure.  Think about how hard life has been without tractors and modern agriculture, spending all day out on the fields to grow your own food with physical work and hope it is enough for all.  One late frost or a mediocre summer meant it would be a rough time for you and your family.  Without the sheltered homes we've grown to love, winters has been cold, long, and miserable.  Also, the absence of modern medicine left you vulnerable for injuries and diseases. Women got pregnant all the time and gave birth to a lot of children in the hope that some of them might survive and grow up to be adults.  Only to see their lives be wasted in one of the numerous wars. 

What I want to say is - yes, there's probably reason to be scared.  

Climate change will bring some significant challenges and consequences.  Some may well be unavoidable by now.  But we will cope, and we will manage.  Individually, and as humanity all together.  Don't give up on life before you personally have a reason to be more desperate than all the generations before you.  They might not even have seen a future, or a job, yet they never gave up.  Pursue a full life, it is the only one you have. Get a good job. And don't think this is not a place for children to live anymore.  They will grow up in a different world than we used to know.  It is sad, even heartbreaking, that some of our natural gemstones like the coral reefs might not be around anymore when they are adults.   After all, we want to leave them a beautiful planet, and not one in turmoil.  But they will adapt as our whole planet is in the process of adapting.  Consider that some of our major coastal cities are under water.  It will be an incredible challenge when it is imminent, and happening.  

But just some more centuries ahead, it is just a chapter in history books.

I think Climate Activism can have the same effect.

30 years ago, being openly gay was something you only did in San Francisco. But people got vocal, marched in parades, fought for status and rights. By increments and exponents, public perception changed. It wouldn't have without the activism.

This time, we don't have 30 years.

Look at all those concerned people that care.  I know it can feel like the problem is unsolvable just by the nature of the problem being outside the scope of our typically short-sighted, self-interested human nature  to deal with, but it's not.  Every year the science gets cleared as more scientists devote themselves to studying this problem.  Every year more talented communicators, writers, artists, taste-makers, public figures, show biz folks decide to stand up and shout it out loud and communicate the science to the masses in a way more and more people can believe in... And we act.  Every day more evidence hits the media and more people decide to do something about it... We may be racing the clock but as we see more evidence of scary stuff like feed back loops
More and more people will throw themselves at this.  Eventually it may even come down to geo engineering or sending a few people to Mars or space or something, or moving under ground until
We figure out some solution for the surface ... But that's beyond you and and it's beyond me.. So live your life!  And don't worry about the WHOLE PLANET, it's too much for any one human mind.  Focus. Focus. Focus.  What's the right thing to do for just you?  And just try to do that.  Look, I'm struggling just to write something to try to make you feel better.  Im failing.  But you know what, ITS ALL OK!  We're allowed to make mistakes.  So go out and try to do something and if you fail, at least you failed and died while trying.  That's my philosophy for a happy life.  And if it's too paralyzingly and scary, don't act... Do something fun.  You're suffering from a panic attack of thinking about the future of the whole world that you can't control because no one human can.  But don't worry about stuff that's out of your control... Just do you... Anything else is a recipe for mental anguish.  That's not going to help you or anyone.  I don't mean sound like I think I know better than you... Sorry for all the advice.

As most people around here know, I'm pretty concerned about the fact that all this CO2 we've been releasing is a toxic gas, and we don't know the threshold at which long term exposure to it is detrimental to human health.

In other words, I think that within a few decades, chronic diseases are going to be rampant, and babies are going to have trouble surviving, just because of the atmosphere we're creating.

Here are the papers I'm basing this on:

[Just how ‘Sapiens’ in the world of high CO2 concentrations?](http://www.skepticalscience.com/how-sapiens-in-the-world-of-high-co2-concentration.html)

"d6s8w72","t3_4z1apr","4z1apr","collapse","skeptical",">Is there a chance that climate change could be less awful than we think it will be?

I doubt it, mostly because data collection methods have come very far in the last 20 years. We have a much clearer picture today of what direction the climate is going in, much better than in the 60's and 70's when global warming first became a mainstream concern. 

>Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?

I think it will be survivable, but I don't think we are going to be living in a world like the one we live in today. By that, I mean a world where you can do whatever you wish as long as you have the money to do it (or buy it). It's likely we are going to see a world that is much smaller for people than it is today. You aren't going to be getting on a plane simply because you have money. You won't be able to buy a gas guzzler simple because you have money. Instead, I think we are going to live in a world where resources are used in a more judicious manner. Does that mean the shift will be easy? No. People will be drug kicking and screaming into a new living arrangement. I don't think we'll even see the beginning of that for another decade. 

>Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?

No, dirty secret here: We are taught about the economy as if it's a force of nature. People speak of it as if it came about from nature itself. The economy is a result of human choices, and humans can choose to do something else. There are many theories postulating what an economy not based on growth could be. These people are ostracized from their field. You have to go to low-rank schools in the field to find them. Among these, and probably the most famous, is Herman Daly, who wrote the book on Ecological Economics. If we as a society choose to live in a different way, then we can. 

>Can geoengineering save us?

No, but it can buy some time to shift our course. This is going to be a hot topic in the next decade. I think China is going to be the first to act on it, with or without permission. China has a lot to lose if we get to 1.5C. There will be some fighting over it, but in the end, it will happen. 

>Can personal lifestyle changes prevent catastrophe?

No, this is a collective action problem. It is, in the end, a political problem. We need solid, intelligent, brave leadership - the kind that does not exist at the moment. We need to, as a people, support those who are courageous enough to call out the ills of society. Honestly, most people are too poor to make serious lifestyle adjustments. Government exists for a reason. It can be bloated, inefficient, and sometimes abusive, but in the right hands, government has improved the lives of billions of people. As much as people complain about government, none of us would be sitting here talking with each other if it wasn't for a government investment. There is little profit to be found in certain activities, stopping global warming is one of those activities at the moment. With the right policies, we can get things on track. 

I have to admit, I am not in the least bit hopeful any of this will happen. There are strong incentives to continue things as they are. We are also dealing with short term thinking. People like their comfort and they like being told everything will be ok. The problem is most people are stuck in the past or live entirely in the moment. Most of the people who hang around here are future-oriented, even before they came to this sub. They don't live in the moment. They live in some nebulous future to come. Most humans don't live like that. While I might be wrong about some of you, for the bulk of readers, I'm pretty sure I'm on the mark.

> * Is there a chance that climate change could be less awful than we think it will be?

Yes. There may be negative feedback loops that will moderate the climate with faster action that we know about. Perhaps these act on timescales that don't show up in the fossil record.  But even more likely than that is that things will be worse than projections, because so far that's been the trend. Scientists are motivated to downplay this stuff. 

> * Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?

The 'real economy' is a shadow on the wall. The truth at base is that what we are doing is not sustainable. That word 'sustainability' is abused so much that most people gloss over it's true meaning. But really think about it please. We can not sustain the current pace of economic activity, never mind any more growth. We probably couldn't sustain the 1950's level of activity!

Whether it is 'survivable' is a silly question. Of course we'll survive as a species excepting a massive asteroid or climate catastrophe. Or do you mean business-as-usual will survive? Nope.

> * Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?

Yes. It needs energy to *run*, nevermind grow. At base The Economy *is* the process of converting energy into goods and services. In the past, we'd capture energy from the sun via plant-life and use it to produce stone tools, which made life a bit better.  As the economy grows, we need more energy to do all the extra stuff. If you're doing something that doesn't need energy, you're not doing something worthwhile to anyone. 

If someone invents a way to make mousetraps with half the energy it just means we'll make more mousetraps. 

> * Can geoengineering save us?

No, but it can sure FUCK things. Humans have a really poor track record with the climate. I don't trust anyone currently with the power or resources to practice geo-engineering. Elites trying it is one of my red lines. I will not permit anyone to try it, regardless of their arguments.

I shouldn't be so harsh. Geoengineering *in theory* could help us, but the problem is that no one understands this stuff well enough to do it right, and in the interest of the whole population and not just a cabal. If we can't fix our lifestyle problems, we shouldn't employ global change to make up for that fundamental weakness.

> * Can personal lifestyle changes prevent catastrophe?

Yes. It's the only thing that can.

Picture the batter hitting a pop fly out to center field.  The outfielder makes a snap judgement and starts running to catch the ball.

Now ask yourself this:  How does the outfielder know where to run?  Even while the ball is still in the air?

Simple, just about anyone can judge the trajectory of a flying object and make a pretty good guess about where it will land.

Not a prediction, mind, just a guess.

No one knows what will happen in the future.  The baseball, for example, could hit a bird or get caught in a violent gust of wind.

Learning to judge the possibility of collapse is very similar, collapse is a process after all and not an event, and that process has a trajectory just like a baseball.

No one can predict the future, or exactly how collapse will unfold.  Nuclear war could end it all tomorrow.

But just like you can guess where a baseball will probably land, it's not hard to judge the trajectory of industrial civilization.

Our ecological overshoot has been long and steep, exponential growth is like that, and it follows that our exponential decay on the way down will probably be just as steep.

no. the only reason we had a major delay in rapid warming (from the 1950s until probably nowish) is ocean currents cycle heat down from the surface, and there's lag time until that global-warming heated water comes back around.

i tooked at look at how some of the IPCC climate models function, and there is absolutely no way they would be able to account for such a phenomena.

> Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?

i'm not convinced the limits of growth is particularly applicable. we keep finding more deposits of resources. and if we stopped producing tons of redundant products and throwing things away, and developed an economy of maintenance and upgrade we could probably use a shitload less. cyclical resources cycles probably defeats a limits to growth type argument, as the sun is dumping boatloads of free energy on us from the sky.

> Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?

we should probably stop measuring the economy in terms of money. because money =/= time =/= resources =/= anything objectively measurable. this is hard concept for a lot of people to grasp but it's true.

and why do we care about the numbers growing anyways? money definitely does not equal happiness. we should be focusing on making people happy, not maximizing a dollar amount which ultimately has no real connection with anything. money turns life into a utterly meaningless game where people get excited over credit card releases. 

> Can geoengineering save us?

possibly. though i'm not convinced we're going to be able to implement anything without *all* conscious beings contributing.

> Can personal lifestyle changes prevent catastrophe?

no. individual changes are not enough to fix anything since *all* decisions with far reaching ramification are made at a higher level of society. pushing most responsibility to unorganized individualism is a recipe for disaster, and directly responsible for where we are today. yes, everyone needs to do something, *but it needs to be done together*.

Climate change will be survivable for some people.

Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?

It has already been catastrophic for many people and we are still on the undulating plateau before the downslope.

Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?

Yes, There is a difference between relative decoupling and absolute decoupling. Nothing is possible with absolute decoupling from energy. 

I think geo engineering is just as likely to doom us as it is to save us but this is just based on my gut not well thought out evidence based reasoning other than the anecdotal observations of every other time we apply complex tech fixes that produce unintended consequences.

yes if everyone started consuming only at the subsistence level and started keeping total fertility below replacement level we could.

I listened to what the ""mainstream"" climate scientists were saying.  And ignored and rolled my eyes at the ""alarmists""  for a very long time.

Yes, especially if your idea of awful is informed by McPherson cultists. The mainstream scientific opinion looks pretty awful in and of itself though. Sea level rise is going to be extremely expensive, many places that are currently habitable are going to become uninhabitable for human beings and people will emigrate. 


* Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?

Economic growth seems like a tricky question. Technically you don't need an increasing amount of a single resource (like oil) to have economic growth. The biggest factors for economic growth are things like social stability, demographics, good governance, increased specialization/education and investment in R&D. These factors are in turn influenced by other more basic factors that are influenced by resource inputs.


The bigger question than economic growth is the security and sustainability of the food supply. If climate change induced drought, heatwaves, flooding etc. decreases, or even just limits the growth of the food supply then we will see larger regions of the world fall into chaos and state failure. Social engineering to reduce the birth rate in developing countries looks somewhat successful to mitigate this, but leads to other issues: bad demographic profile and so on.

* Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?

Sort of, see my answer above.

* Can geoengineering save us?


Maybe, but it would seem to increase the risk of serious inter-state conflict. I think geoengineering is inevitable. My view is that it should be started on an experimental scale as soon as possible, in order to test and develop new international legal frameworks. It could also be used to encourage public anger against vested interests and right-wing opponents of climate change mitigation and adaptation in America and Europe. A simultaneous crackdown on bad actors in the US, the EU and China would be great progress on these issues.


* Can personal lifestyle changes prevent catastrophe?

Absolutely not. Personal lifestyle changes are not bad or anything, but they are not a substitute for government policies, international cooperation and so on. The place where lifestyle changes might be useful is through attempts to change social norms like not eating insects in the west.

"d6stq0l","t3_4z1apr","4z1apr","collapse","skeptical",">Is there a chance that climate change could be less awful than we think it will be?

Probably not. Ecologically, it might not be as bad as people imagine. People usually think ""ecosystem collapse"" means something very different from what it actually means. Practically, though, it seems unlikely that it will be less severe than people think, in terms of sea level rise, threat to urban centers and coastal areas, and adding instability to a global agricultural system that is already overstretched. In that sense, we are probably still underestimating rather than overestimating the consequences.

>Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?

The end of economic growth isn't necessarily a bad thing. The current regime will be unsustainable, but the current regime isn't doing much for the average person anyway. So there's a potential that letting the house of cards fall might lead to a better situation for everyone.

Or it could simply lead to a situation where the raw exploitation of human resources replaces our ability to exploit natural ones.

The real question as to which path it takes depends on how organized and knowledgeable people are about the situation. The new mayor of Rome, for example, was elected from something called the Five Star Movement, which is a populist Italian political movement which specifically has *degrowth* as one of its platforms. So the potential is there. If something like the Five Star Movement became a global movement, or if degrowth was widely understood and accepted prior to collapse, then the transition to a zero-growth economy might not be that bad. But from where we are today, it's not very realistic.

>Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?

Yes, if you want that ""real"" economic growth to have real material and energy outflows. Theoretically you could make a simulated economy that experiences ""growth"" in terms of GDP (even if the transactions it ""produces"" never refer to physical trades)... it would be ""real"" in a way, but you wouldn't be able to take the output of that growth and expect to have an infinite supply of resources to ""buy"" with it in the real world. I mean, Monopoly money is ""real"" (in the game of Monopoly), and unicorns are ""real"" (as a real consumer demand among 4-year old girls), but that doesn't mean you can actually buy unicorns with Monopoly money.

>Can geoengineering save us?

Sure, if you have a cheap and virtually limitless energy source. Let's pretend that someone invents a low-cost, high-efficiency, easily-deployable photocatalytic power system next year. Let's say that it goes public on the stock market and is simultaneously stolen by the Chinese, with companies in Germany, the US, and China rolling these systems out so fast that they're practically going bankrupt to capture the market. The result is that the world has a nearly infinite supply of dirt-cheap squeaky-clean energy, starting 5 years from now. Could geoengineering ""save"" us then? Yeah, maybe. 

>Can personal lifestyle changes prevent catastrophe?

Barring mind-control? No. The problem with personal lifestyle changes is that they're... well, personal.

"d6vmgsp","t3_4z1apr","4z1apr","collapse","skeptical","I talk a lot about human beings not able to control their collective behavior. I can approach this in a lot of ways, but one way I use is the fact that social complexity creates unaccountably. For example, the United States has been waging proxy wars across the globe for decades. Are the networks of people responsible for this accountable to us or some regulating institutions? Or think of the financial system, which is largely incomprehensible to most people. In what way are the financiers accountable for the devastation they cause?

I don't think meaningful accountability can survive in complex systems because corrupt/parasitic/unfair people will find a niche from which to operate. Such destructive behavior then grows and corrupts other networks and institutions, becoming symbiotic with them. For example, relentlessly advertising junk food makes the advertising industry symbiotic with the for-profit health system in the United States - as well as the fitness-fad industry and more.

This is why climate change can't be dealt with. There are too many unaccountable networks of people that can stop meaningful change from happening, and unaccountability is what ultimately is going to have power - by nature of it being unaccountable.

No. Climate change is going to be a revolutionary force. Rational nations have already gotten in front of the issue, and might manage to stave off the immediate shocks. Nations, like the United States, will plunge into chaos and war. They don't have a rational way to make decisions, nor are the powerful interested in helping anyone. 

I expect to see mass desertification, wildfires, intense hurricanes, rising waters. The winters will occasionally be horrific grueling grinds through mountains of snow. The summers will be worse. I'm gearing up my house to have solar powered air conditioning because the summers will become unbearable. 

Should we survive what climate change has in store for us, and I'm not even talking about the wacky worst case stuff here, it will be because people like us hunkered down and created safe havens for small pockets of humanity. 

Millions of people will be blindsided by the betrayals their systems of death have prepared for them. Their abandonment will come as a shock. I will try to help who I can. 

> Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?

There will always be a nebulous force called ""The Economy."" It's current configuration has already collapsed. It turns out that if you give all the money to a small group of sociopaths, they won't trickle it down, but will instead plot against the populace to further themselves. Nestle, for example, is a demonic presence on the earth that should be eradicated. We will return to an position that insists no one person should have more power then the country. That will be afterwards though. 

Until then, I will produce what I can, and create an economy based on principles of life, instead of principles of death. 

> Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?

An economy of death does. Economies of death require constant sacrifice to grow. That's why we plunder and rape other nations. The monster needs to be fed. 

An economy based on principles of life would abhor theft and violence. The heart of western economics is slavery, wage slavery specifically, which will result in uprisings and the quelling of said uprisings. Capitalism is simply regressing back into a form of feudalism, where corporations are just names of kingdoms. 

The only way to get away from that is to stop interacting with those kingdoms, and continue building local social organizations. The more people realize they've been abandoned, the easier this will become. 

> Can geoengineering save us?

No. Geoengineering can't time travel. We're passed the point of no return here. We're on a roller coaster that's plunging us towards a vat of boiling lava.

Geoengineering will be useful for me, should that be the case.

Can't time travel, so no. The whole point of having a government is to be able to make sober, rational, collective choices. There is never was a free market solution to this, because humans are naturally short sighted, selfish, delusional, morons, incapable of understanding the most basic principles of sharing, kindness, and collaboration without being taught how. 

We had to make a law that says ""Don't kill each other."" That's how shitty and grotesque humans are. We haven't even begun creating laws that say ""Don't destroy your environment,"" because we're simply that shitty. 

We are capable of being rational. We are not rational. The hope is that, together, through discussion, and reasonable discourse, we can find rational solutions to legitimate problems.
