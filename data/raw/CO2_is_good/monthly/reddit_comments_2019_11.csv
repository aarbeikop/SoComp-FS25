It is 100% true that plants grow better when there is more CO2 in the air. Admit it and move on. Most plants are made up mostly of CO2 and water. Plant growth is limited by not having enough of those two things (or, of course, by having too much). Commercial greenhouses pump in up to 4 times natural levels of CO2 because plants grow better with that level of CO2 in the air. We won’t see 4 times he atmospheric levels, maybe ever. So long as there remains enough water and sunlight for the plants, more CO2 is good for them.","2019-11-01 12:07:20","5","deck_hand","1747915315.5452437","CO2 is good","manual"

It is a complex issue, but let me try to sum it up, as I am travelling and no time for more detailed reply.
Increased CO2 persentage in the atmosphere (from some 200 particles per million to today's more than 400ppm) could be beneficial in some parts of the globe as it will result in increase growth of the plants (improved photosynthesis, longer and warmer periods for growth etc). 
Unfortunately, these benefits will have limited spatial distribution, as most of the globe will be under negative stres and possitive effects will rapidly diminish over the time for the most of the globe.
Consequently it can be concluded that the greening,or positive effects will be exponentially smaller than negative effects of CO2 increase.","2019-11-01 10:42:01","2","ClearAsWord","1747915315.5546908","CO2 is good","manual"

"f6w0tpr","t3_dq1tsf","dq1tsf","climatechange","action-oriented","Some say that more CO2 would be better for plant life since plants grow in areas with higher
CO2, which is why plant nurseries pump CO2 into greenhouses and why plants can open their
pores more widely, allowing them to lose less water from evaporation. Plants also only absorb
about 10% of the 38 billion tons of CO2 that we are pumping into the atmosphere. About 40%
dissolves in the oceans and 50% remains in the atmosphere.
a. One should also be aware that there are also high chances of water shortages, flooding
and heat stress. This offsets greatly overweighing the gains.
https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/science/uk/obs-projections-impacts
b. Also, more greening of plans means more photosynthesis and therefore, means more
water consumption. There is not enough greening to prevent CO2 build up in the
atmosphere, which increases temperatures and rising temperatures can cause heat stress
on plants. Heat stress can cause certain crops and vegetation to become infertile and
damage fruits.
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/82f1/b86399eb78eb991cdc70bf26c511be97c205.pdf
c. Even so, more CO2 would not mean more to absorb, plants only keep their stomata open
for certain (and short) periods of time, which limits how much CO2 they can absorb. The
stomata being open also makes the plant lose water.

d. For those who want a clear summary of what science has determined with respect to
plants growing in elevated CO2 environments, read on.
1) Increased CO2 does cause plants to grow faster.
2) Increased CO2 increases overall plant biomass.
3) Increased CO2 decreases plant nutritional value.
4) Increased CO2 helps some plants significantly, and other plants very little. As a result,
ecosystems are expected to change as the changing CO2 levels change species' relative
viability.
5) Changing ecosystems has substantial, and often hard-to-predict, effects on other
species. Climate change is considered one of the main drivers of the extinction event that
we've already begun. An extinction cascade is a real risk that would affect us all","2019-11-08 11:10:11","1","[deleted]","1747915315.5678515","CO2 is good","manual"

Other regions may indeed experience ""greening"" (much of it in India and China) -  both can happen at the same time... but note that greening is dependent on the existence of nutrients and water, and i remember to have read somewhere that the effect also has a natural saturation point. 

Moreover, it doesn't mean that the extinction of plant and animal species will be stopped. Greening doesn't equal ""healthier ecosystems"". 

But most importantly, any co2 fertilization/increase in photosynthesis it's not nearly enough to reduce or slow down the accumulation of co2 in the atmosphere, so with increasing temperatures expect greening to change into browning in the future.

In short, you are correct to suggest that just sucking the CO2 out of the atmosphere won't do, but it isn't a dystopian ""end of times"" thing to say so.  The mark 1 tree is remarkably good at what it does, but we can't just plant a monoculture of ten billion trees a year and call it done.  Even ten trillion.  But it will be useful assistance - at the end of the day we do need to reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere, and even if we went net zero, there would still be a need to draw some down.

There are several key issues at play here: CO2 sequestration, climate change itself, biodiversity, and politics.  Ultimately I do not consider the original study (as you write) to be shoddy.  What you are reporting on is how science is conducted.  This is a good thing.  The problem is that this area is politicised, and therefore the science is being used for one reason and another, for everyone's particular point of view.","2019-11-03 20:50:59","2","Enigma_789","1747915909.4072974","CO2 is good","manual"

Doubling mass every 7 days, they're limited by their micro-nutrient availability (which is something human intervention can help with), they've already been demonstrated to do climate change (in the cooling direction) 55 million years ago.

The ultimate biggest saver is massive reduction in manufacturing demand which can potentialy give us >50%. This however is in direct contrast to the current economic model which jobs depend on so is not even put on the table for debate.","2019-11-05 09:02:16","1","Jerryeleceng","1747915909.4209008","CO2 is good","manual"
