I've stumbled on some videos from this guy Patrick Moore, who is a self-professed anthropogenic climate change denier; I watched a few videos, but he seems to essentially reiterate the same talking points in every single interview/presentation.

I have sort of a soft spot for him since we are from the same part of the world.

He makes some pretty ""logical-sounding"" arguments, and some snazzy graphs, but again, I am totally uneducated in this field and trying to learn more.  My only exposure to this issue is watching Inconvenient Truth way back whenever it came out

Here is a vid of his if you aren't familiar, you can flip through it.  This is the most concise one of his that i've found.

I searched his name on this reddit but couldn't find much, besides a few small threads where some ad hominems  were thrown around.  I saw one redditer claiming he's just old and senile, but in a 40 minute unscripted interview, he seemed pretty snappy and coherent.

I like to try and hear both sides of contentious issues like this, and I was wondering if anyone familiar with this guy's stance would like to give some counter points?  He gives sort of a too-good-to-be-true opinion of the climate situation, which I really want to believe because I don't want our planet to be in danger! But above all, I want a firm grasp on the facts.

If you don't have time to flip through the vid, I'll list a few of his points, what do you think of these claims of his?

-Climate hasn't warmed in 20 years

-A hotter world is a wetter world, leading to more humidity everywhere, and more plant growth, more arable lands  (I thought if glaciers disappear we would have massive drought-affected areas?)

-""We are in an ice age now"", 

-CO2 could hit a maximum of 1,500 atmospheric ppm without negative effects on humans

-Plants can thrive with up to 50% more CO2 than they normally glean from the atmosphere; he keeps bringing up greenhouse operators increasing the temperatures and the plants growing at accelerated rates compared to just growing outside.

I want to believe this guy because he puts forth such a peachy view of things, but geopolitically, the climate situation is made to sound really dire to the average lay person.  In my part of the world, our form of carbon taxation has recently really ramped up, and has had quite an impact on the average taxpayer, which has fuelled my interest in the matter.  

What do you guys think?  Thanks for taking the time!
