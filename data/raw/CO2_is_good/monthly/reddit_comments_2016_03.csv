One good pic to visualize things and here's another messier one that shows the forcing *very specifically* added by CH4 absorption.

"d0mfqod","t3_48sr9y","48sr9y","climate","scientific","Your nuclear science friend should understand blackbody radiation, where every object emits radiation in a spectrum that is directly related to the temperature of the object. The surface of the sun is around 6000 deg C, and so the majority of radiation it emits is high-frequency (including visible) radiation.   

The Earth's surface is warmed by the Sun, and is obviously a lot cooler, so it emits long-wave (infrared) radiation. This heat is re-radiated back to space.    

The issue is that CO2 almost entirely transparent to the incoming, high-frequency solar radiation, but's it's partially opaque to outgoing long-wave radiation from the Earth. The thickening blanket of CO2 is therefore helping to trap heat.  (Your friend could take a look at [this resource](http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C124389&Type=IR-SPEC&Index=1#Refs) used as a reference by scientists, to understand the absorption spectra of various elements and compounds) 

---  

If the Earth lacked an atmosphere, the Earth would be at an average surface temperature of -18 deg C, which would be hardly habitable. However, due to various greenhouse gases (including water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane), it has a lot more habitable temperature of +15 deg C. A doubling of CO2 will take the Earth's temperature close to +18 deg C, and with land masses warming faster than the oceans, many highly populated regions of the Earth will become far less habitable.    

---   

Solar radiation has been in slow decline since the 1970s, so it has a perfect alibi. [This page](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/) is the best I've seen at showing how the majority of recent warming is directly attributable to the increase in CO2","2016-03-03 20:16:03","2","fungussa","1747873150.7350423","CO2 is good","manual"
"d0ml2nu","t3_48sr9y","48sr9y","climate","scientific","All great answers by the commenters below. Paradoxically, deniers with science backgrounds/knowledge are even harder to convince than your typical conservatard denier. It's political and apes are political/emotional creatures. Your friend will probably never change his stance and is most likely to double down on the denial as the evidence mounts. It's  no coincidence that the vast majority of the most strident deniers are white males who lean right. I know a bunch of engineering types in the peak oil world who are not bad guys and not even all that political that cling to milankovitch cycles like a life preserver.  If you have been following for a long time you will have noticed how many went from it's not happening to, ok it's happening , but it's not that bad and it's not us. Yeah it's frustrating eh? We have the ability to be rational, but we are not rational creatures. Our emotional reward seeking (dopamine) limbic system drives the bus. I like to throw the fact that all the previous mass extinctions involved massive amounts of co2 releases including the KT. The only thing different is this time we're the volcanism/trigger. After presenting the evidence, I  never get any alternative explanations back on that. A handful of guarantees of last minute techno saves.

"d0majm5","t3_48sr9y","48sr9y","climate","scientific","The sun sends a vast amount of energy entirely beyond infrared and that is the ""problem"".   173,000 terawatts hit us at the top of the atmosphere and all of that needs to balance with 173,000 terawatts of energy leaving ... or the equilibrium of heat changes until it *does* balance.   [Like any object sitting in the sun.]

A 9500 deg F spotlight shines on us within a -470 deg F black freezer.   That's the earth.   Things that bounce off the top of the atmosphere (or are absorbed) are of no real concern to us down here.  Whatever gets *through* our transparent atmosphere can be changed *into* infrared glow from heat.

All those terawatts need to get back out to space.  The sky (from the perspective of a infrared) now looks more and more ""misty"" and ""dim"" due to CH4 and CO2.  The air is less able to let the ground cool .. because (in IR) it is simply less transparent where heat forms on the surface.   Water changes form over and over... absorbing and releasing heat, but CO2 and CH4 never do.

Also ... terawatts have many ways to be reflected that are going away.  Do they reflect back as well on areas without sea ice?  No.  Do they reflect on tundra that changes into chilly swamps or new grasslands?  No.  Can we release heat through low overcast ... when an area used to be a dry dry frozen tundra?   No.   Suddenly and fearfully, no.

If the energy makes it near to the surface or surface clouds and becomes heat (as it has for forever), it must be balanced the same way as before or things change.

One should not attempt to alter the size of a vast spillway without finding out the dam will overtop at some point.
