"4lza8q","collapse","skeptical","Climate - we ARE fucked. Reasons why....","Say we stop polluting in 2019 because of massive world collapse - many people think it will be a good thing for us, but we've travelled too far down the heating road for it to be.

The global dimming effect of all the pollution drops, the heat rises FASTER.         
Kicking us while we're down...

Then there's feedbacks - we've baked in 2 degrees because the temp now is mostly from pollution we pumped out in the SEVENTIES!

That heating we have still yet to see will cause some feedbacks - like CO2 from frozen rotted tundra that melts and starts decaying.

Then the methane everyone talks about in the ocean cathartes, and on land.

Then the reduction in reflection of white ice, that lets the ocean absorb all the sunlight.

Another one is that ice takes 85 TIMES more energy to melt, than it takes water to rise one degree. Ice in a glass keeps the whole drink cold, until it's gone - and then it warms rapidly. You see what that means?

ALL this ice melting now in the poles? That's going to be an 85x boost in heating once the ice melts in an area. That blue-ocean event? Chances are the ice won't be coming back.

So no - there's no good news - we needed to STOP society in the 70's... we didn't and now we're simply fucked (with everything else on the planet).

If we can do carbon sequestration we can solve some of the issues - but we're talking about millions of tons of carbon... quite an undertaking.","2016-06-01 03:33:46","3","35","0.56","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/4lza8q/climate_we_are_fucked_reasons_why/","True","SarahC","1747876440.0117955","CO2 is good","manual"
