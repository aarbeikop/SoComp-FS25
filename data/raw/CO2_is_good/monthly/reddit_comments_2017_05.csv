I don't think that what he states incorrect information so much, it is his inferences about increasing CO2 that are the problem. His basic position is that CO2 is good for plants and is essential for a healthy biosphere and that we inhabit a historic low CO2 era IIRC. This is correct and he makes some very interesting scientific points on this topic. Unfortunately his logic continues like: more CO2 is good for plants/biosphere and all other effects on temperature, infrastructure ect are insignificant or inconsequential. As if the very long term health of plants should be humanities only concern or something. He presents graphs and talking points with insanely long timescales. Timescales that are completely irrelevant to the rate of warming and increasing CO2 that we are observing with climate change. This is all just off the top of my head so do some reading but perhaps this will help you frame arguments or questions while you read.

"dh2mb1s","t3_68ydgt","68ydgt","environment","emotional","I am a vegetarian for the same reasons as you. This summarises it pretty well. It's important to remember that a vegetarian diet is generally cheaper. This allows me to use the saved money to offset my footprint. While the reliability of carbon offsetting is still a very new, unregulated and controversial topic, my opinion is that it is still better than not doing anything. If you do not believe or agree with carbon offsetting, you can always invest the saved money into other environmental projects. Basically, do your thing with the money.

I also wanted to add a few other points. While reducing meat intake is a very good choice in terms of footprint, you should also ensure that the food you continue to purchase has as low a footprint as possible. Generally this means buying locally sourced food, avoiding overly packaged goods, choosing brands that (at least) claim to do their bit when it comes to environmental protection etc. 

Unfortunately, the more you commit to such goods the more expensive the shopping gets. If you are willing to spend extra and go super-environmentalist you should try to adopt a purely fresh plant-based diet. Fresh fruit and vegetables require the least amount of processing and so are the ""greenest"" choice. It's also wise to avoid palm oil as this drives the demand for the Indonesian rainforest destruction and several other destructive projects around the world.

The sad thing is that in the current state of things it is very hard to live as ""green"" a life as many of us would like without having to spend vast amounts of money, and even then there are compromises we would still have to make. The good news is that the more people adopt this lifestyle the easier it will get. By mechanisms such as economies of scale we may even see a ""green"" diet become cheaper (this depends on the size of the demand and several other factors).","2017-05-03 12:51:48","3","[deleted]","1747885965.0519757","CO2 is good","manual"

Certainly, coastal system health is a big concern, so I'm glad to see those students getting some exposure to studying it.

I've watched a new Environmental Science group form so I can appreciate the task.  What are your feelings about Environmental Science as a standalone (i.e. teaching students to be environmental scientist) versus more of an interdiscplinary program drawing from students of Chemistry, Biology, Geology, etc?  

I met Bryan Brooks when I was at Ball State, and enjoyed hearing the work he was doing.  These emerging contaminants are a challenge, do you think that we have enough analytical tools to address new threats?  What are challenges with current and emering/future threats?

I did work some with DOM/nanomaterials, trying to understand solubility and more clearly which parts of DOM interact with them (FT-MS).  The project had some challenges, with the main student dropping out due to loss of support.  So one big elephant is federal budget cuts and how that might impact your research and those in your department.  For instance, the president is suggesting a 31%! cut at the EPA.  The nanomaterial work was an EPAStar grant and I am worried that emerging contaminants studies will be greatly harmed by funding reductions.  Are there routes here to get around this or is all the important work just going to move abroad?

I'll leave it at that, and look forward to your responses.  Thanks.

I am a bachelor student at a lab where we work with quantum dots mostly. A month ago I was in an accident where an erleymeyer burst and oleylamine (at roomtemperature) got on my skin. Fortunately it was just a few drops so it was not too bad. Quantum dots would have been different, I think. In MSDS sheets you can't find much information about the effects of long term exposure to stuff like quantum dots but also stuff like toluene, which we use outside of a fume hood to clean sometimes. Where can I find more information about this? What do you think is the most underestimated chemical in terms of long-term damage? For example, a few decades ago people washed their hands with benzene to get organic chemicals off. This turned out to be carcinogenic. Is there anything you think people should be more aware of?

-Do you have suggestions for further reading on the subject especially as it pertains to uptake of the chemical into fruits and veggies grown in tainted soil with water well above the health advisory level?","2017-05-23 16:22:27","2","GBFel","1747886018.0711114","CO2 is good","manual"
