"dq54f1z","t3_7eed7h","7eed7h","climatechange","action-oriented","My question for you is, why does it matter so much to you? Let's look at some basic facts: the official narrative from the IPCC is that **most** of the warming recorded is very likely due to human activities.  Some say 100%, others say a lesser amount.  The only authoritative claim is that ""more than 50%"" is caused by human activity.  Is that human activity 100% due to CO2 caused by the burning of fossil fuels?  Nope.  Some of it is the building of hard structures, the clearing of rain-forests for farming or grazing land, some of it is the curing of cement or other industrial processes.

The US is responsible for something around 5 GT of CO2 being released each year.  We are on a downward trend, overall, since 2005.  We have also greened a good bit, adding forests where there was nothing but fields, and planting a lot of trees in what was industrial space.  The developing nations of the world are on the opposite course, cutting down forests still, building coal power plants, increasing the use of cars, trucks, factories.  

As time goes by, our portion of the CO2 problem gets smaller and smaller as a percentage of the emissions released.  Does your father own a coal burning power plant by any chance? Or, maybe he operates a steel mill?  If not, then he's likely not in a position to have a big impact on changing the direction of planetary emissions, land-use, or cement pouring across the developing nations.

Does it harm anything to just let him be wrong on this?  And, do you know for a fact that he is completely wrong?  The best, most highly paid scientists in the world can't pin down how much man-caused climate change will actually affect the temperatures today any better than they said they could 40 years ago.  Their original guess was 3 degrees per doubling of CO2 plus or minus 1.5 degrees for the most likely scenarios.  Now, they are still at approximately the same place, but are having to back off of the high, catastrophic warming projections that were always fairly unlikely to happen.  More and more papers are being written, peer reviewed and published saying that mild warming is more likely than catastrophic warming. Which, you know, is essentially what he's saying.","2017-11-21 15:00:53","5","deck_hand","1747891132.0141597","CO2 is good","manual"

"dq4p2ee","t3_7eed7h","7eed7h","climatechange","action-oriented","This will freak out some people, but I'm going to suggest it anyway. Have a look at *The Climate Fix* by Roger Pielke, Jr. 

Pielke is absolutely hated by a certain segment of climate activists (the hard-left, hand-wringy ones) because he has told them their methods are ineffective. Pielke is neither the skeptic nor ""denier"" as his enemies would like to paint him as. Instead, he's a pragmatist that thinks climate action necessary, but doesn't think it will happen if activists keep using the same playbook.

Now this particular book isn't directly focused on climate science, but is recommendation from someone whose even-handed treatment of the subject will appeal to a conservative.","2017-11-21 06:18:28","1","Will_Power","1747891132.0251684","CO2 is good","manual"
