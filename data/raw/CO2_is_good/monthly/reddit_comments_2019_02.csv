I'm 56 and minored in Environmental Systems modelling in the early 80's. I have followed the progression of the science ever since. And I have gotten more concerned about Global warming every year for the last 35.

It's real. I don't want it to be -- I have kids, I want their lives to be great-- but it is real. We have a hell of a lot of work ahead of us to fix it.

There's plenty of books on the topic that lay out the science. Go read one.  Or, go read the IPCC assessment for policymakers. It's online.

If anything, the IPCC assessment is conservative, because they know that if they get too far out front, the whole ball of wax gets discredited. It talks about likelihoods and probabilities. 

Living systems are the most complex things there are, and we are dealing with a whole lot of living systems interacting and changing each others' trajectories. So there's no simple way to get your head around it all. It will take time. 

This is the hardest problem the human race is ever going to have to solve because to solve it, we're going to have to change how we relate to each other and the world. I think that's where a lot of the resistance from people like your Dad comes from.  

So study up, and then do what you can. Don't get discouraged. Ignore the white noise. Read the science and think it over. Then act.

"efhy4da","t3_alw8h9","alw8h9","climatechange","action-oriented","It's a dead end to argue about ""climate change"" — because that term can be defined in so many different ways. Two people whose views differ will tend to use the most self-serving definitions, and will wind up talking about totally different things.

I think it's much more productive to talk about actual environmental conditions which may be linked to climate issues — but even if they're not linked, they still need to be addressed.

I usually identify four such issues:

* Sea-level rise

* Ocean acidification

* Ecosystem collapses

* Higher-energy troposphere (basically, increases in storm frequency/intensity)

Anyone can make productive observations and conjectures about these topics, regardless of their position on the slippery ""climate change"" spectrum.

Also there's one set of concrete facts that I think can't be overlooked:

* 3200 gigatons of CO2 currently in the atmosphere.

* 400-450 Gt of CO2 emitted annually by natural processes

* 400-450 Gt of CO2 absorbed annually by natural sinks

* 35-40 Gt of CO2 emitted by manmade processes.

I don't think anyone can really deny that a high-carbon atmosphere is coming, and thus a high-energy troposphere is likely. The interesting questions are:

* When will global manmade CO2 emissions reach a plateau?

* Once that plateau is reached, will we collect any data which suggest how a climate target may be identified and eventually reached?

That's a scientific fact and there's no way to deny it. Earth has had some warm times, some colder, some with low oceanic levels, some with high, some with low CO2, some with insane CO2. 

However (!), the time scales between natural change and the past 150 years don't fit.[It took the Earth around 11,000 years to go from 19°C (Ice age) to 23°C (modern temperature](https://xkcd.com/1732/). 11,000 years is a pretty short period of time in Earth scales.

I make this observation because in too many debates, the trope that ""the science is settled"" is often touted by those who subscribe to the climate change (IE ""probably correct"") hysteria. If the science is supposedly settled, why is there still so much debate from scientists and educated persons on both sides of the debate?    
  
Know that the science is not settled because science is not about consensus.We should be more concerned about scientific method: hypothesis, observing results, peer review* and adjusting or disbanding theories accordingly. But complications of politicization, grant suckling and lobbyists (both pro and con climate change) are foisted upon us. It gets ugly and complicated very quickly.  
  
The science is indeed not settled because there is very little science involved. The debate forges on because there is more substantial evidence to challenge global warming/climate change supposedly resulting from rising CO2 levels from anthropogenic activity, but this matters very little when appealing to peoples' emotions.  
  
Rather than trying to convince your father (because of your emotions), perhaps you should invest the time in understanding both sides of the discourse and arrive at your own conclusions. I know this will be a monumental task, but it is a worthy endeavor.  
  
*The concept of ""peer review"" has been sullied as scientific journal publications have been compromised and easily duped. So you see the complexity of this and similar issues are difficult to navigate and make arriving at solid data to support theories that much harder.

"ehef200","t3_av06wf","av06wf","climatechange","action-oriented",">1) Is the climate changing more rapidly than we have observed in the past 150 or so years? Seems likely.

Yes, that's a fair assumption to start with.

>2) Is it caused by human intervention in the environment? It is hard to just say, ""the science"" points to yes, especially knowing first-hand, that there is an extreme amount of bias and subjectivity in drawing conclusions in any scientific study. That is precisely why we do not depend indefinitely on a single source for any cutting edge result. 

Fair points in general, although the comment about bias and subjectivity is misplaced. Scientific inquiry is almost always our best tool for drawing conclusions free of bias and subjectivity. While there's plenty of bias and subjectivity in climate discussions, almost none of it results from actual scientific claims. 

>Has literally any scientific study thoroughly assessed the possibility this is due to one of many, many astronomical perturbations of Earth's non-nominal rotation, oblateness, not-perfectly-elliptical and variably perturbed orbit, or effects of other celestial objects (ex. the Moon, Jupiter, potentially undiscovered objects in the LaGrange points of the Earth-Sun or Earth Moon systems, etc.)? Some mention astronomical effects very briefly (the most I have found is a single sentence that immediately rules this out as a possibility), but I have a very deep suspicion that they were not very thorough investigations. So as far as I have read, these things have not been addressed, and if you have anything to say otherwise, please share. My goal is to educate myself and make my own judgement call, not to blindly accept some biased researchers' opinion.

Investigations into these factors have been limited, but for good reason: If these factors were strong enough to influence the climate, then they would exert an even stronger influence over things in our neighborhood that are even easier to measure (orbits of the Moon and asteroids, for instance). 

Probably the main variable in this set is one you haven't mentioned: It's possible the sun's output will vary somewhat chaotically in the future, making it difficult to devise long-term projections. But evidence for chaotic solar output isn't very strong right now. You would have to find some really good evidence on that point to make a coherent case out of it. 

>3) Is this a bad thing? Will there be doom and gloom as a result?

You're right that reports on this issue are frequently overburdened with sensationalism. Poverty kills people much faster and in much greater numbers than climate effects do. Climate discussions which fail to give even greater weight to poverty issues are probably indulging in sensationalism. I think it's fine to just set this topic aside every time it comes up. This problem just doesn't lend itself to scientific analysis.

>4) Should the US be the primary entity held responsible for changing it? I strongly believe that it is quite naive and overstates our ability, let alone to even begin to understand how to positively influence a trend in such a complex system as the global environment. 

Nobody thinks the US is the dominant climate influence on Earth — I mean, the only people who might think so are some very egotistical Americans, who are completely ignorant of how large the globe and its population actually are. It's safe to ignore all those folks and instead just think for yourself. The global climate is a global issue; it's not responsive to individual decisions made by individual nations, with the possible exception of an oil state which sets wells afire in the open air (Iraq).

>Additionally, how can we rule out that this is not just a ploy for self-aggrandizement for the political left? 

In terms of global politics, the ""political left"" is a trivial influence. You can safely ignore that influence and, again, just think for yourself by focusing on actual facts and scientific analysis. 

>5) Is this a good thing? Since we will reduce the number of people dying from extreme cold, that certainly is not bad. Will an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to any other negative effects on the environment at large? 

Nobody really knows, but it's safe to say that if a climatic system is in equilibrium and then departs from that equilibrium, there will follow a period of adjustment in which established patterns — of ecosystem development, economic development, etc. — get disrupted. As a civilization, we're constantly in a state of low-level adaptation to change, but usually that change is economic or technological and our adaptation methods for that are pretty good. If ecosystems or environments change...our adaptation methods are more uncertain. Periods of adjustment to those changes can be rough, even temporarily chaotic. Chaos probably isn't ever a net benefit to civilization as a whole. Anticipating chaos is a difficult assignment, but sometimes it's worth trying anyway.","2019-02-27 15:27:37","2","DocHarford","1747907681.1647866","CO2 is good","manual"
"ehegj8t","t3_av06wf","av06wf","climatechange","action-oriented",">Will there be ""new normal"" extremes in weather patterns? We cannot even accurately predict the weather. What makes us believe these same models can somehow be more accurate over decades? 

This skepticism of yours is well-founded: We probably have very little idea of what the state of the actual climate will be in 2080 or 2100. 

But people who think we have that predictive ability are, again, misrepresenting the actual science on the issue. Climatologists don't actually claim to be able to predict the state of the climate many decades hence. What they typically do is take a given set of initial conditions and then extrapolate them forward. 

This isn't really a ""prediction."" But it's still a useful exercise, because it can show how *sensitive* the climate is to certain (extrapolated) influences. Before about 1970, nobody had any idea how to measure ""climate sensitivity."" But now we've conducted a half-century of inquiries into this question, and we've produced a range of conjectures, some of them quite startling. 

Some of the conjectures are so startling that they practically demand intense further research — especially into complex systems like the atmosphere, the oceans, and biomass. That's where we're at right now: Climatologists have made an overwhelmingly strong academic argument that further research into certain environmental influences and systems is vitally important for reaching a certain level of understanding about the climate.

Unfortunately a lot of people have misinterpreted this academic argument as a matter of grave public urgency, which is probably a mistake — although it's understandable. And some scientists don't do much to emphasize that their conclusions are mostly useful for directing future research, not for directing actual public policy; this is also a mistake, and it's less understandable and more indicative of some bad faith. 

So if you want to get mad at someone for acting in bad faith here, you might be able to find a small handful of scientists who fail to properly restrain their public claims, or who fail to offer proper disclaimers about the limits of their models, predictions, etc. But in my opinion, that's probably a waste of time. Scientists aren't *really* responsible when people misunderstand and overstate their fairly modest scientific claims. It's really the fault of laypeople who insist on remaining completely ignorant of the incredible complexities and imprecisions of the process of making long-term predictions about colossally complex systems.

"eh5o9vo","t3_at68ka","at68ka","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm going to repost something I've posted here in the past that addresses your question:

--- 

Let's get down to the basics of climate change:

- CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning that increasing the amount in the atmosphere will increase global temperatures, all else being equal.

- It is one of several greenhouse gases. The one that accounts for most of the greenhouse effect is water vapor. That's important to know, for a reason that we'll come back to later.

- The direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 is an increase in temperature of about 1.1°C, but that doesn't include feedbacks.

- There are positive and negative feedbacks. A positive feedback is one that amplifies a given change in temperature and a negative feedback is one that dampens the change. There are thousands of feedbacks in the climate system.

- When feedbacks are factored in, the resulting temperature change is referred to as ""climate sensitivity."" There are two kinds of climate sensitivity discussed in AR5, the IPCC's fifth and most recent assessment report: ECS and TCR.

- ECS stands for equilibrium climate sensitivity. This is the amount of warming per doubling of CO2 that you get once all the feedbacks have had time to settle in. It's important to note that it takes decades or even centuries to reach equilibrium once a doubling is reached.

- TCR stands for transient climate response. This is the amount of warming expected while CO2 is rising and at the time that a doubling is reached.

- Preindustrial CO2 was about 280 parts per million (ppm), so a doubling would be 560 ppm.

- Present CO2 levels are about 400 ppm.

- Future CO2 concentrations will depend on lots of things like population growth, CO2 emissions per capita, natural carbon sinks, etc. My own best guess is that we won't reach 560 ppm until near the end of the century.

- Producing a value for either type of climate sensitivity is really, really hard. AR5 listed the likely range as 1.5-4.5°C per doubling. That's the same range as was first proposed in the 70s or 80s. It's been really difficult to narrow it down because the climate system is chaotic and extremely complex. 

- One significant paper that didn't meet the cutoff for AR5 was Otto, et al 2013. It suggested that ECS is on the low end of AR5's range.

- As far as most of us are concerned, TCR is the most relevant measure of climate sensitivity because we don't have to wait for feedbacks to shake out like with ECS. 

- AR5's estimate for TCR was 1.8°C per doubling.

- The uncertainty around TCR is much smaller, meaning narrower error bars.

- One paper after AR5 had TCR as low as 1.33°C per doubling.

- All of this assumes that all or most of the warming from the last 150-200 years or so is due to changes in radiative forcing caused by GHGs. If subsequent studies indicate that more of that warming is due to natural causes, then TCR and ECS will have to be adjusted lower. 

- Warming over the last 150-200 years has been about 0.9°C, meaning that we've experienced half the warming we should get from a doubling of atmospheric CO2.

- Assuming that almost all of the warming is due to changes in GHGs, and using the IPCC's best estimate for TCR, **we should experience another 0.9°C of warming when we reach 560 ppm (a doubling from the preindustrial levels of 280 ppm).** Estimates of when that will happen vary and depend upon assumptions about how quickly we will decarbonize, **but it will likely be toward the end of this century.**

EDIT: I'm linking a random graph. They note their methodology is different from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Do you realize in this house every night Princess Earth comes down to the 21 BlackJack table plops down 100 bux and then win or lose is always back the next day. Her bankroll is fat she could crush us but still we send human eve up there with our $3 from the coal mines. The casino is some fancy European style where they give you compound interest on money being held in chips. So every night both Eve and Earth lose all their money but thanks to compound interest from the casino plus borrowing $2 from China and $1 from India.  Soon their cashing in $5 and Princess Earth is cashing in $105 each night. You win a hand and get comped one of those half sized water bottles (aka an el Nino year) but princess Earth says ""who cares sugar baby watch this"" she snaps her fingers and the dealer turns up the thermostat in the casino so Eve starts sweating (radiative forcing from the inversion layer).

If they're anything like my great grandfather who sits by the window all day but never tans then this will make a lot of sense to him.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry but I went through the same phase you are going through back in October actually. I was having something that I could only describe as panic attacks and severe depression when I first heard about the IPCC report that came out at the time. Nothing you are saying here is new. It's all very, very well-known, well-studied and you just frankly gave a bunch of links to articles from websites like ""Skeptical Science"", ""Glacier Hub"", etc. with the only scientific journal or study you linked to was one by Yale.

&#x200B;

You are way too defeatist and you are writing some long essays to vent your frustrations but what are you actually doing about it? How will this essay change anything? You spewed non-stop statistics and biased information to make everything seem so horrible that it's irreparable. If you did your research, you would find out statistics on how America is rapidly reforesting the continent. Costa Rica is a renewable haven and can run for 300 days of a year with no coal or oil. Scotland, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, etc. are so ahead of the curve in terms of environmental policy and infrastructure it's awe-inspiring. China is surprisingly very forward thinking when it comes to the environment (double edged sword I know but a huge nation with humanitarian issues should be taken with a slight pinch of salt. At least they're trying). You say things like countries are deforesting their countries, but you never acknowledged any of the positives. Do you not see the HUGE shift in public opinion on climate change? Everyone who should be taking it seriously IS taking it seriously. You're going to care about the opinion of skeptics and uneducated individuals? Why? If the scientists and leaders of the world take it seriously which they DO (except for Trump and Bolsonaro), why do you care what the uneducated civilian thinks? They wouldn't notice anything even changed.

&#x200B;

Look into both the negatives and the positives and more importantly, ACT. Join the Citizen's Climate Lobby, become a protestor or activist, set up your own initiative or company, solve problems in your own local community. Don't just copy and paste your essay onto Reddit and hope something in the world will change because of it.","2019-02-04 00:22:28","4","blackgxd187","1747907835.0438173","CO2 is good","manual"

Actually, it does: When people talk about CO2, very often they mean ""CO2 equivalents"", where all greenhose gases are considered, and their effect expressed as ""how much CO2 would have the same effect"", because communicating only one figure to point out a problem is easier than publishing a long list.

And, as you mentioned, all (or most of) the other problems are directly or indirectly tied to warming. So let's tackle this one first (which, in itsself, is an enormous task!) and see what other problems remain afterwards.","2019-02-04 07:57:37","1","ebikefolder","1747907835.046505","CO2 is good","manual"

Which makes sense -- rich people can burn a lot of CO2 jetting around the world and living in mansions, but they do not use more soap and shampoo and do not eat more than even the middle lower class in the developing world. So palm oil demand is driven primarily by population growth.

I don't agree :) 

I gave up shampoo and conditioner 10years ago. It's was never a thing for millennia. So why do we need to chop the forest down to put chemicals in everyone's hair?  Visit the prepper community, thing they tell you to prep is toilet paper.. I haven't used a roll in a decade, how many trees do we need to cut down so people can smear shit around their ass with paper?   Sure population is a problem but knowing that we have to use less, so what do we do? Use more... Does the Green New Deal address this? Incentivise vasectomies, tax having children? blah blah blah  no? More well paying jobs in green industries? Wtf is that shit.. All that means is people will spend money miss allocating valuable resources...like shampoo in their hair and a dog that needs grooming and someone to walk it etc

I use the above as example but there are 1000s.

Sure population is a problem, it's why I had a vasectomy and have no kids.  The sustainable level of the planets population is I'd argue about 7-8 millions. We fucked this up thousands of years ago. Sure, ignorance is a reasonable excuse until the 1900s or so. But we often linkaid to these places o my if we don't I close education in family planning we drew up artificial geopolitical lines all over paper and fucked up people's ability to live when they needed to and then exploited them with colonisation . What... The actual fuck.. 

But thus is not really a sustainability problem either, it's a human behavioural problem. People care more about their hair than they do about the enviorment.

There is no coming back from this because of that reason. No amount of reasoning will get people to even change their vote, let alone examine their fucked up lifestyle of overconsumption be they some rich asshole in India, or the USA.

Third world aren't environmental saints. They are simply poorer and thus their impact is lower. [The West on the other hand...](https://wriorg.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/uploads/historical_emissions.png)The US army is #1 CO2 emitter, I don't see how any other nation can have more destructive attitude towards nature.

Who decided to use palm oil so rapidly? Did third world people suddenly decide to use it? No, it was the corporations (majority are western of course) seeking huge profits ignoring the environmental costs. Did Indonesia and Malaysia decide to rapidly expand palm oil production? No, it was the IMF (a Western organization) that pushed them to do so. All of that is mentioned in the very same article you linked.

> rich people can burn a lot of CO2 jetting around the world and living in mansions, but they do not use more soap and shampoo and do not eat more than even the lower middle class in the developing world.  

I guess the rich get off the hook for their [astronomical emissions](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/12/2/1449046370471/4d8525a5-be37-4d04-a275-ccdbd30c98b7-620x431.jpeg?width=700&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8000eb2185f9e827c2a30057e36aae7c) now?

I'm going to guess you are an American. So here's something for you, instead of running around calling people dimwits for stating facts, do something about your country's military emissions. When the West has as much per capita emissions as Indonesia and Malaysia, you will be in position to advise others, otherwise it's pure hypocrisy.
