"6ywwp2","climatechange","action-oriented","Where is everybody?","In light of the recent hurricanes in the gulf, forest fires across the entire West, and rising temperatures across the globe, I'm pretty astounded at how few people there are here. While I've always known that climate change is real and that it is a problem, over the past few weeks of digging into the literature I've been kinda blown away by the staggering magnitude of the future we're currently looking at. Even after reading this sub for a bit, I'm amazed at how blase everybody seems to be acting. If it was just one or two massive changes I might be able to pass it off as chance, but it seems that nearly everywhere is being affected by this.

Am I overreacting? I would like to believe that my imagination is getting the better of me, but when we are literally seeing the effects in live time it's hard to imagine that this is the case. Either way I'll be paying much more attention to this problem in the future, and I'm going to start trying to contribute in some way to the efforts to combat it.
