In 30 years 30-40 year olds lost 17% of wealth. So, what else happened in those 30 years?

In 30 years humans emissions went up [50%](https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/c02-human.png?w=768)

In 30 years wind and solar reached [4%](https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/energy-sources.jpg) of total energy use < 1.5% / decade

In 30 years we failed [4](https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/canada-emissions-record.jpg?w=768) world climate agreements > 1 / decade

In 30 years we had 25 COP world climate conferences

In 30 years we been at war 18 years or more

If you are 15 years old, human emissions went up [30%](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

We have to reduce emissions [50%](https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-cliff-1.jpg?w=768) in 10 years to stay below 1.5 °C

This year the Paris Agreement is dead, and [1.5 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0)°C is last year's 2 °C.

In 10 years emissions will be [38% higher](https://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-1-5c-climate-target-slipping-out-of-reach) than needed to stay below 1.5 °C

**imo:**

We are already too late to stop 1.5 °C, and crossing 1.5 °C triggers cascading tipping points, leading to runaway hothouse mass extinction, that cannot be stopped or reversed once started

Political Economists talk about 3 °C as if it were connected to reality

As a crotchety cranky ol' geezer, this is how I would describe intersectional collapse

[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0)

* ""The world’s remaining emissions budget for a [50:50 chance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0) of staying within 1.5 °C of warming is only about 500 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2. Permafrost emissions could take an estimated 20% (100 Gt CO2) off this budget[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0#ref-CR10), and that’s without including methane from deep permafrost or undersea hydrates. If forests are close to tipping points, Amazon dieback could release another 90 Gt CO2 and boreal forests a further 110 Gt CO2[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0#ref-CR11). With global total CO2 emissions still at more than 40 Gt per year, the remaining budget could be all but erased already.""

But it's worse than the above quote describes because it only concerns climate, and not a host of other collapse drivers like run away mass extinction, which works both independently and intersectionally with climate and political drivers.

In the past 100 years humans and livestock drove 80% of species extinction, and now say hello to my new little friend, climate change. It's going to help us out.

You cannot easily sense climate change when you are 20-30 years old

This clash of political power is 100 years old, you can't contextualize the rapid change in political climate

When I was 18, I was a progressive socialist ideologue raised by a 70 yo hippy grandfather in the 70s.

I am not that person anymore, and neither will you be

In 10 years the world will be short of food and water

"dr0sqw","collapse","skeptical","How much of our carbon emissions could we sequester by planting new trees? Try 5%.","[This](https://www.uni-bonn.de/news/reforestation-may-not-be-sufficient-for-fighting-climate-change) is what you read everywhere:

>In early July, a study  in Science made global headlines: Earth could carry 4.4 billion hectares  of canopy cover, which is 900 million more than today. Through  reforestation, 205 gigatons of carbon could be removed from the  atmosphere and climate change effectively slowed down.

You´re going to continue to hear about this, for years, even though it´s bullshit. Four different teams of researchers sent letters to the magazine, all of them insisting that this study is very flawed. Their estimates on how many new trees we could plant and where we can plant them are extremely unrealistic.

Instead of 205 gigatons of carbon, the critics suggest the real figure is closer to 20-30 gigatons:

>“The calculation method ignores, for example, that pastures or arable land also contain large amounts of CO2,” said Luedeling. The estimate of well over 200 gigatons of carbon, which reforestation could remove from the atmosphere, seemed considerably too high to him. “I think 20 to 30 gigatons are more realistic.”

How much have we emitted since the start of the industrial revolution? From 1870 to 2014, cumulative carbon emissions totaled about 545 GtC. In other words, assuming we can remove 30 gigatons, you´re looking at 5% of our emissions. If we really try hard, we can remove 5% of the carbon we emitted from the atmosphere.

Why do these figures differ so much? The original authors were inflating the potential area, by suggesting they can just turn places home to billions of people into forest again. They were also suggesting planting trees in the tundra, completely ignoring that this would merely warm the Earth up further. Finally they fail to recognize the sequestration of existing ecosystems. Essentially, the original study was shoddily done.

It´s a nice idea that we can just remove carbon from the atmosphere, but we were already warned long ago that the emissions are essentially forever. Once we release the carbon, we can´t put the genie back in the bottle. Unfortunately people didn´t reduce the emissions fast enough, so now everyone is coming up with bullshit and feel-good solutions to suggest we can still fix the problem. We were supposed to keep the fossil fuels in the ground, but we didn´t do that, so now we witness the consequences.","2019-11-03 14:05:13","136","55","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dr0sqw/how_much_of_our_carbon_emissions_could_we/","True","mushroomsarefriends","1747915908.7636786","CO2 is good","manual"
"dypnj7","sustainability","action-oriented","Numbers on Carbon capture tech","Hey guys,

I recently read an [article](http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-engineers-develop-new-way-remove-carbon-dioxide-air-1025) where MIT researchers are able to develop low energy intensive carbon capture tech at lab scale. They were able to bring down the energy cost to  1 GJ for 1 tonne of CO2 ( Most existing tech is in the range of 4-10 GJ).

Although commercial scale up feasibility of the tech not tested yet, I took that energy cost as reference and calculated energy needed for CCS to absorb entire current emissions of US as a percentage of their current total energy consumption. For the calcs, I assumed 300 GJ per capita consumption, 330 million population and 5 billion tonnes of emissions. It turns out that to capture entire US emissions, CCS energy cost is only 5 percent of their current total energy consumption! ( 5 billion GJ out of 99 billion GJ) This number sounds too good to be true, am I missing anything?

If this number is true, US can easily allocate  5 percent of their annual energy cost to carbon capture. Maybe another 2-3 percent needed for pipelining and storage. I have been very skeptical of CCS, but now it looks very feasible with these numbers.","2019-11-19 19:50:44","2","0","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dypnj7/numbers_on_carbon_capture_tech/","True","zenneutral","1747916069.2469542","CO2 is good","manual"
