Within a year, the CO2 from roughly 1 kWh of fossil fuel burnt will trap an additional 1 kWh of heat via atmospheric warming. The CO2 will continue to trap heat for 1,000 years, trapping a total of 1 MWH of energy for every 1 kWh of energy that you actually use today.

"cqf3ld8","t3_32vliv","32vliv","environment","emotional","Well I have a problem of sorts appear in a daily basis. The first thing I needed to understand in order to come back at them was the fact that there are actual researches and solid sciences that says the global warming is not an anthropogenic effect, meaning it is not caused by humans; at this point you could either agree or disagree with me, but the fact is, that at this point in time we have frozen poles on the earth as we did not millions of years ago, meaning earth is not as warm as it used to be. Having said that, understand that the only real argument to say global warming is not a thing was that one; and even so, that study does show the earth warming up in the last 5000 years from concentrations of CO2 extracted from the lower ice caps of the poles. The earth is warming and the real debate is if it is human caused or not. 
Now, here is where it becomes tricky, the main gas that produces the greenhouse effect is CO2, the reason it does this is becas the atoms of said gas have a natural frequency very close, or even the same, as infrared light, which produces heat. Then, the infrared light that comes from the sun hits the earths surface, warms it up, and the remaining light that is neither absorbed or used by the earth's surface or the living organisms in it, has to be reflected back into outer space; however, if the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere in the atmosphere is higher than it is supposed to be, once infrared light tries to escape the earth and it's atmosphere it hits the CO2 atoms and breaks the bonds of carbon and oxigen releasing energy in all directions, this energy, that was supposed to leave the earth is instead being reflected back to us warming the earth even more.
Think about it this way, imagine fish tank, only its bottom is a trampoline, so lets say you throw a ball into it, the ball bounces and leaves the fish tank. Now, throw the same ball but only this time the ball when trying to leave encounters a net that have holes, meaning if the ball is thrown properlly it will pass through one of the holes on the net and exit without a problem. So for the sake of the argument, say you throw millions of balls, some will get through and leave, some however will hit the net and bounce back into the fish tank. For global warming imagine each time CO2 is produced it ends up in the atmosphere, meaning smaller holes, and light is constant, given that balls were the protons in my analogy imagine a constant rate of balls going inside the fish tank. If the CO2 emmissions increase, that means it will trap more and more balls each time, those new ones that try to scape the tank for the first time and those who have tried and failed and are bouncing still inside the tank. That is what accounts for global warming.

"cqfkyf8","t3_32vliv","32vliv","environment","emotional","I'm sorry that you had this experience, but I wonder why you were so angry.  I mean, if you disagree, that's fine.  I don't agree with my sister-in-law that mushrooms or shellfish are something to avoid eating, but I don't get angry with her over it.  I don't agree with some people over issues of race, or tax policy, or immigration, but rage isn't something that is a result of our disagreement.

Individuals making their way in the world will have different opinions, you're going to have to get used to that.  Most people speak about these things from a position of at least partial ignorance.  This is why I continue to evolve my opinion as new information comes to light.  

As I understand it, there is a huge disconnect between what we actually know, and what people *think* we know.  For instance, we know that the world has warmed since the 1800s.  It's clear in the instrumental record, in the proxy reconstructions, etc.  Exactly how much it's warmed is almost never discussed.  

We have thousands, millions of temperature measurements using a great variety of different thermometers, taken at different times and under different conditions.  The accuracy of the thermometers varies between 0.05º C for some, and 0.5º for others.  

Add to this, even after the actual measurements are taken, the numbers are adjusted by the thousands, homogenizing the actual readings with other thermometers of varying qualities that are up to hundreds of miles away.  I'm not sure that this is a valid thing to do (I would NEVER do it).  I do know that my local surface stations vary by up to about a degree, and that they are all consistently a couple of degrees cooler than readings only 20 miles away in a ""rural"" surface station operated at an airforce base.   When the ""homogenization"" happens, they don't lower the temperature at the base, they raise the temperatures recorded here, a higher quality station.

In addition to that, the readings of the past have been altered dozens of times, and the cumulative change have been about half a degree of global warming.  Remember that these readings were taken by the same generation that designed nuclear bombs, designed rockets that got us to the moon, so they were not all incompetent.  

A lot of the ""adjustments"" have been claimed because of Time of Observation changes, which is perfectly valid.  The issue here is that many people used to read the thermometers at noon and midnight, or noon and 6 pm, or something else, which were not the hottest or coolest times.  The Time of Observation rules have been re-evaluated lately, so that we have consistent reading of thermometers, and I think they are all Min-Max now, rather than time based.

But, I can only understand why one might make ONE time of observation adjustment. Another valid adjustment is because of equipment changes or a physical relocation of the station, if it moves a significant distance.  Actually, if it moved a significant distance, I'd just consider the old station as ended and start a new designation for the new location. 

If a certain surface station has its trend adjusted 30 times, but only had one equipment upgrade and one Time of Observation change, what are the other adjustments for?  If the climate scientists saw a need for adjustments for readings during, say the 1940s, I have no problem with them having made adjustments for that.  Why, though, did they adjust those readings every year for the last 20 years?  

So, I have a problem with the number, size and frequency of the adjustments to the OLD records.  I have a feeling that many of those adjustments are spurious, and since ALL of them have the effect of cooing the past and warming the present, which is in line with the need for emergency, I begin to doubt the honesty of those making the claims.

Remember that I don't doubt we are warmer.  I question whether we are actually as much warmer as it is being claimed.

Also, I recognize that humans have contributed to the warming (however much it is).  There are quite a few ways that we contribute.  One way is by changing the albedo of the planet through land-use change.  This is known to warm the local environment (and remember, that's where the thermometers are).  Another way is by the introduction of black soot from burning things (not just coal, but wood, dung, oil, whale oil, etc.).  This coats a lot of the ground an increases the absorption of solar energy, warming the planet.

Also the increase of GHGs should affect the distribution of heat within the atmosphere.  Water (in vapor form) is a GHGs, and it is way, way, way more prevalent in the atmosphere than CO2 is.  We irrigate vast amounts of farmland, and even the ground around our homes.  When we burn gas, oil, or other hydrocarbons, water vapor is one of the emissions, and water vapor is a GHG.

So, I'm not as convinced that CO2 is the thing that we should be focusing on almost exclusively.  Sure, we have contributed to the warming of the world, but how much of a role does increased CO2 actually have?  No one can tell me for certain.  It could be as much as 6ºC per doubling.  It could be as little as 0.8º per doubling. Most anti-fossil fuel advocates will completely discount the low end, while embracing the upper estimate as quite possible.

When discussing things with ""climate change deniers"" try to remember that many people on that side of the isle hold view that you simply don't buy.  But, you very well might hold some views that are also not well grounded in hard facts.  If you want to get past the ""it's real/no it's not"" level of useless argument, try to forgo the base level, and dig into some of the details just a little bit.

Not ""it's warming and it's all our fault, and to fix it we have to leave all fossil fuels in the ground and move away from capitalism,"" but smaller steps.  ""It's warmer now, than in the 1800s, right?  Rivers froze solid during the Revolutionary war, they had ice faires on the Thames, and they are not doing so today.""  That gets past the middling details of exactly how much warming we've had.

If CO2 is *the culprit* then so be it.  Focus on how we can do things better, while reducing costs, having cleaner air, fewer deaths in coal mines and on oil rigs.

Don't bother arguing just to argue.  If you have something that you need from the other person, focus on that.  Is that person going to be influential in getting the local power company to stop using coal?  No?  then does it matter?  One person switching to a hybrid car isn't going to save the world.  We need infrastructure transformation, not just a switch to LED light-bulbs. ","2015-04-17 16:05:16","-1","deck_hand","1747863176.3247406","CO2 is good","manual"
