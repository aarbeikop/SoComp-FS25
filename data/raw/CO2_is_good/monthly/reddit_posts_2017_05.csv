"68ydgt","environment","emotional","Vegetarianism and the Global Environment","In most cases when someone is trying to argue or convince someone to understand their point of view when it comes to eating meat, they take the stance that it is cruel to the animals that are being killed and in a lot of cases that is true in terms of their production, but that argument didn’t work for me. I don't know if its because I'm heartless or desensitized to the point of not caring about the animals well being, but I was never swayed by that point of view. I know that the mistreatment of animals who are produced in large quantities suffer unneeded amounts, but that wasn’t a fact that moved me to make a change. It wasn't until I learned about how intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production affected the Earth in regards to global climate change that I reflected on my habits and how they effect the world around me. I think the idea that myself, someone I knew, my future children, or in general the planet that my species calls home could be put in jeopardy made me think. In this post I am going to discuss the facts that drove me to become a vegetarian and that I would hope would convince someone else to become one as well, or at least reduce the amount of meat they consume. I will use as many trusted sources as I can to provide information that I find to be very important for people to know and to reflect on. In a time where the validity of information is consistently being scrutinized, it is important that the information we spread is reliable.
	
Along with this idea of convincing people to become a vegetarian or at least eat less meat, which is a hard goal in itself, is to convince people that climate change exists and that it is propagated through human actions. For the sake of this post, I am not going to try to convince anyone that climate change is real or not because that would be a large conversation in itself. I am going to assume that anyone who reads any further has a similar mindset as myself when I first discovered this information about global climate change or maybe someone who has an open enough mind to read these this statistics and look into the problem themselves. The first thing that got to me when learning about the affects of meat consumption on the environment was my lack of understanding exactly how everything comes together to form what we know as climate change. I knew that CO2 was a major contributor that everyone focuses on and that methane, nitrous oxide and other gases played a part as well, but I did not know the extent in which agriculture and meat production play into every part that increase global climate change.
	
More often than not when people talk about climate change and its inputs, they are usually measuring the amount of CO2 which gives a somewhat distorted picture of what the true “foot print” is for any given producer of a green house gas. The other gas that needs to be given more attention is methane gas. Methane gas is not always heard about, more than likely because it accounts for a smaller portion of the total emissions and stays in the atmosphere for far less time, but it actually has a warming effect that is higher than that of CO2. While CO2 accounts for around 82 percent of human emissions and remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane accounts for what would seem to be a measly 11 percent. But methane has a global warming potential that is 28 to 36 times stronger than that of CO2, but only stays in the atmosphere for around a decade. These numbers show that methane is just as much of a contributor as CO2, but the real problem is the source that creates all of the methane.
	
Over the last 150 years methane levels have doubled as a result of human activities such as fossil fuel industry drilling for methane gas, as well as intensive agricultural farming practices and growing livestock. While the fossil fuel industry is still the leading producer of methane emissions at 33 percent, livestock and farming make up 27 percent and are aimed to increase in the future. While the amount of CO2 omitted and the need for methane gas for power could potentially decrease over time as a result of better technologies or the eventual peak oil crisis, methane from agriculture and livestock is different. The growth of the livestock industry will coincide with the growth of the human population that is estimated to be around 35 percent between 2006 and 2050. The more the population grows exponentially, exponentially more meat will need to be grown to feed those people, and the more meat needed to feed the population, more land will be repurposed to grow the feed required. This will decrease the amount of carbon sinks available to trap CO2 and keep it from being released into the atmosphere and further add to the problem.
	
Not only does eating a highly meat intense diet contribute to global climate change, but it also comes with a set of global environmental challenges that only become worse if the problem is not confronted. With the rate of population growth that we are currently following there could be upwards of 9 billion people on the planet by the year 2050. This would require an increase in agricultural space for production up to two times than we are currently producing, which would lead to increased loss of ecosystems around the world, including the rainforests that are home to some of the worlds most diverse wild life, as well as one of the largest carbon sinks. The increase in agricultural production would also require more water to the degree that it would be unsustainable and in some cases impractical with the agricultural sector already consuming a staggering 70 percent of the fresh water that is available on the planet. This problem would become increasingly worse since 85 percent of the worlds population lives on the driest half of the planet and three quarters of a billion people don't have access to clean water. The people who live in the drier areas would have no way to grow the amounts of agriculture needed to sustain their local populations and their need for protein rich meats, leading them to rely on other countries who would also be struggling pushing their production to the limits. The water use would increase the amount of chemical runoff from agricultural fields which would in turn contribute to low oxygen rich water, further reducing ocean biodiversity and affecting other kinds of business such as fishing that are important for feeding the world as well as some poorer communities that rely on fish as their main source of food. In terms of water, a shift from a meat heavy diet to a more plant based diet would reduce the amount of water needed to produce food, potentially helping eliminated or diminish the current world food and water crisis.
	
Per person the USDA advises that a healthy diet of meat should consist of about 125 pounds of beef per year. Of the 196 countries on Earth, there are 60 countries that eat more than the recommended amount. The amount of calories that are consumed by people directly through agriculture is only 55 percent while 36 percent is fed to livestock that is then fed to humans at a later time. If those countries that consume more than the recommended amount reduced their meat consumption, to the even the average amount by the year 2050, there is a chance that it could make an impact on the processes that we have to feed our local and global communities. It is obvious when confronted with the numbers and statistics that eating meat at the rate in which we do is unsustainable and a change must be made. Meat does not have to be completely cut out immediately, if at all, but there needs to be a dietary shift away from the consumption of highly inefficient meats. We could feed the world if the crops that we grew in our fields were intended to be eaten by people instead of an insane number of people, who are increasing in numbers exponentially. 
	
I am constantly learning new things in life and am always open to new things and becoming a vegetarian is something that I never thought I would adopt as a way of life. I truly love meat and I miss it all the time, but the world is bigger than my selfish desires. The world is constantly growing and so should our perceptions of it. There are so many things today that need to be changed and we are the ones who can make a difference, and this is a small step towards something great. I hope that the data I shared can change a few minds or open up some to a different way of living.

Hi Reddit! My name is George Cobb.  I am a Professor at Baylor University, where I serve as Chair of the Department of Environmental Science. Throughout my 28 year career, my research group has developed  novel sampling and analysis techniques to evaluate toxic chemical transport, transformation, and biological exposure processes. The tools that we employ most often are GC-MS, LC-MS, and Atomic Fluorescence. We have applied these analytical techniques to the cost effective assessment of chemical profiles and associated risks at hazardous waste sites, in industrial settings, within agricultural monocultures, and near concentrated animal feeding operations.  This research paved the way for service on many EPA FIFRA Science Advisory Panels and one Science Advisory Board consultation.  My most recent research activities have been in the realm of nanomaterial uptake and effect, anabolic steroid aerosols from animal feeding operations explosives, and adverse effects of explosives.


I have helped establish well know graduate programs at three Universities across the USA.  My engagement in professional societies includes chairing the Division of Environmental Chemistry and serving on the Committee for Environmental Improvement within the American Chemical Society, as well as being President of SETAC North America in 2011 and continuing to serve as a Steering Committee member of the SETAC Global Chemistry Advisory Group. In these roles I work with scientists throughout the world to develop a better understanding of the environmental challenges that we face.


My BS in Chemistry is from the College of Charleston (1982), where I conducted an environmental research project, evaluating the uptake of organochlorine pesticides and metals into sea turtles on the South Carolina coast.  Thereafter, I received a Ph.D. in Chemistry from The University of South Florida (1989), where we developed sampling strategies to determine vapor/particle distribution of atmospheric organic chemicals.


Ask me anything about Environmental Chemistry or Exposure Assessment.


I will be back to start answering questions at 11am CDT (12pm EDT, 9am PDT, 4pm UTC)","2017-05-23 11:44:13","1897","138","0.83","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6cu4fa/acs_ama_hi_reddit_i_am_george_cobb_chair_of_the/","True","AmerChemSocietyAMA","1747886017.0640428","CO2 is good","manual"
