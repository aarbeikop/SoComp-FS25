"9d8ic2","climate","scientific","Can we have an earnest conversation about what we need to do to solve the very real environmental problems facing the world today?","I've seen a lot of negativity on Reddit when it comes to enviromental issues, and while the cause for concern is real, the hopelessness is not only not entirely based in reality, but counterproductive. According to experts, the [extinction risk from climate change is between 9-19% over the next hundred years](http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html). That's unacceptably high, but it's far from too high to give up. If we want to stay below 2 ºC warming, for example, we need a carbon price of [$20/tonne by 2020, $100/tonne by 2030, and $140/tonne by 2040, and enough political will to overcome the natural gas industry](https://www.nature.com/news/natural-gas-stands-to-get-a-boost-from-carbon-tax-1.17705). If we really care about environmental problems, there are plenty of effective actions we can (and should) take:

* [**We need to vote**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U). It may sounds trite (or cynical) but whether or not you vote is a matter of public record, and if [EVP can write an algorithm with 89% accuracy to figure out if you care about the environment/climate change](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf), then so can politicians, and politicians only care about their voting bloc, so if you don't vote, you and your values can safely be ignored by those in power. [Stinnett argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U) (rather persuasively, imho) that the reason climate change didn't end up in the last debates is because of the anemic turnout among environmentalists. If we want politicians to care about the environment, we need to show them that it's worth their while.  I've personally donated over $100 to [EVP](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/) because it turns out [it's really cheap to turn out environmental voters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U)), and EVP currently only has enough funds to operate in 6 U.S. states. We tend to [grossly underestimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) how much the rest of the public agrees with us on this stuff, but the truth is, [the number of people who say climate change is extremely important to them, personally, is at an all-time high](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/public-support-climate-policy-remains-strong).  So let's not squander this opportunity. With [~15 million superenvironmentalists across the U.S. not voting](https://thinkprogress.org/15-million-super-environmentalists-dont-vote-in-the-midterms/), we could truly be a force to be reckoned with and make demands of those in power if only we showed up. If you have money to [donate](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/donate), please do. If you don't, you could probably be at least as effective by [volunteering](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved). If you don't have time to volunteer, please at least [sign the pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge) to get reminders about upcoming elections in your local area, and maybe share your committment on social media or invite some friends to join you.

* Maybe you have a hard time mustering the will to vote because none of the candidates fit your ideals perfectly (if you really despise them all equally, at least vote for a write-in so you still show up as a voter). Either way, there's a really good chance that whoever wins will not be perfect. So **what we need to do is lobby**. [Lobbying works](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), and [you don't need a lot of money to do it](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) -- though it *does* help to [know effective tactics](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) (hint: [write, call, and visit *your* member of Congress](https://twitter.com/editoremilye/status/797243415922515970?lang=en)). Even those members of Congress who seem hopeless [can make a change for the better with the right approach](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/lobbying/creating-champions-in-congress-and-in-the-media/). [Climate change is arguably one of the most pressing issues](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) facing humanity today. If we want to stay below 1.5 ºC warming (a [wise choice, and still possible](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-report-exclusive/exclusive-warming-set-to-exceed-1-5c-slow-economic-growth-u-n-draft-idUSKBN1JA1HD)) we will need to get off fossil fuels, which means [we will need a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), which is expected to [spur innovation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2f60/cbfc3dcf2538140bbf07f43cf7038b8af8c8.pdf) while also [reducing emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy). If you're interested in free training in how to lobby Congress/Parliament, [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) offers free training to anyone in the world (though if you live in Kuwait, you may have to start your own chapter) in how to lobby for [Carbon Fee & Dividend](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/), a policy supported by [scientists](http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199856978.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199856978-e-026) and [economists](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Pricing carbon would also have significant [co-benefits of reduced local air pollution that are sizeable enough to make the policy in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf) (e.g. [thousands of lives would be saved in the U.S. alone](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy)). The policy would also likely reduce plastic waste, since plastics are made with fossil fuels, and fossil fuels would be more expensive under the policy. It [may come as a surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples), but a majority of Americans in [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) and [every Congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/) supports a carbon tax. CCL is maybe ~45k volunteers from passing CF&D in the U.S., but that's peanuts when you consider that [10% of Americans (that's tens of *millions*) would 'definitely' be willing to join a campaign to convince elected officials to mitigate climate](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). [30% of Americans](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-May-2017.pdf) would be willing to join such a campaign if someone they like and respected asked them to, so bring a friend or two. I've personally donated thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours to CCL (and recruited more than a couple friends) because I think what they're doing is so important. If you can devote about an hour a week to lobby for a liveable planet, [sign up here](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/) for the free training. If you don't have time to train as a lobbyist, please at least sign up for free [text alerts](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) so you can join coordinated call-in days. 

* I know there's a climate march coming up [this Saturday](https://peoplesclimate.org/), but while [protests can be effective at raising awareness](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/stop_raising_awareness_already), we are well [beyond](http://www.climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Six-Americas-2018-Mar.png) the point of awareness being a barrier to climate change, and [protests are not effective at passing legislation](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), for [reasons that will be obvious](https://www.ttbook.org/interview/barney-frank-why-protests-dont-work). **We** [**need to graduate to effective tactics**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/is-there-any-point-to-protesting) if we want to actually accomplish things that matter, and [protests can be an effective jumping-off point](https://qz.com/901411/political-protests-are-effective-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/) for doing that. So, if you're planning to marth this Saturday, maybe you can get some people there to, for example, [sign the Environmental Voter Pledge](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sign-the-pledge). 


* **Population growth** is something [both the public and scientists are worried about](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/08/scientists-more-worried-than-public-about-worlds-growing-population/). There are [plenty of effective actions to take](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/650.full.pdf?casa_token=eWZHHLNe6SwAAAAA:Vwhrywg2A8q_GOA1g1IjwZOaegqcHXkPIhWjDoVQfbgIwKiMHEOS7OXsn5bxSeMy5ANNN8U2kOswp5o) to curb population growth that *don't* involve [human rights violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#Sexual_and_reproductive_rights)), so please don't advocate for oppressive limits on the number of children other people can have. Rather, if you want to help curb overpopulation, [it would help to improve childhood mortality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=QsBT5EQt348), by, say [donating to](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) the Against Malaria Foundation, or [donating to girls' education](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/education) to reduce fertility. Roughly [32 million unplanned births occur each year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727534/). Even in developed countries, [unintended pregnancies are common and costly](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-40-percent-us-births-unintended/story?id=16840288), and can have [deleterious effects on offspring](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775543/), including a [higher risk of maltreatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070372). [Implants, IUD, and sterilization](https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Increasing-Access-to-Contraceptive-Implants-and-Intrauterine-Devices-to-Reduce-Unintended-Pregnancy) are the most effective forms of birth control (yet [sterilization is often denied to women who know they don't want children](https://www.ted.com/talks/christen_reighter_i_don_t_want_children_stop_telling_me_i_ll_change_my_mind)) and [policies which give young people free access to the most reliable forms of birth control can greatly reduce unintended pregnancies](https://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/30/colorado-teen-pregnancy-abortion-rates-drop-free-low-cost-iud/). If you're interested in preventing unwanted pregnancies in the U.S., consider advocating for [Medicare for All](https://www.medicareforall.org/pages/Sign_Up) or [Single Payer](https://www.healthcare-now.org/).

My students are going to be doing a project in which they calculate the CO2 emissions from their school, and propose ways to reduce the school's carbon footprint.  I have them calculating CO2 emissions from busing, from electricity usage, and from food.  The busing and electricity usage will be easy, but I'm having trouble coming up with ways for them to calculate carbon footprint for food.  Is there a good way to estimate the carbon footprint from the food?  I have looked at the carbon footprint calculators online, and they don't really provide any good info.  I know that the transportation of the food is an important factor.  Any info will help greatly!

"9iw9w5","environment","emotional","How and why the state of the economy is relevant to everything about the environment...","So, needless to say, within the last 200 years or so, humanity has become an extremely industrialized species. Multiply this by the number of people in the world, and you have an economic machine out of control, running 24/7, day and night... Nobody holds the machine accountable: it just keeps on going... Recently there was the Paris Climate treaty to try to address CO2 levels... A good step in the right direction. But what I think really needs to be looked at, and discussed, is the management of resources... 

For instance, I've participated in multiple ""beach cleanups"". While, they did have their impact, I couldn't help but think how insignificant it was that a few people cared about the state of the beach, while there was industrial level trash dumping in the ocean... No matter how many people came to the beach to clean it up, however often, it still couldn't compete with the pace of industrial level trash output... There is no way people can undo certain damage that certain careless action causes. So the obvious solution is not to ""combat this"", but rather, to strike it at its source, and make sure it doesn't happen. 

What this requires is HOLDING COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE for what they do with their trash, and REALLY not letting them do retarded things, like dump boatloads of trash in the ocean... (This is just to describe a general principal)... 

There is no way that people can counteract careless industrial action, as it is much easier to destroy than it is to build. The KEY is to keep it from happening in the first place... 

Laws? Cool. But how many big corporations are in bed with lawmakers? How many big corporations would rather SAVE MONEY by doing a couple of favors for a couple of politicians in return for some favorable legislation, than to spend money, year after year, ensuring safe environmental practices? Most, because most care about MONEY, not the environment...

In this current capitalistic world, MONEY is all that matters. If a company doesn't have to spend money properly disposing of waste (for instance), then it won't... 

MONEY is what matters to industry; not the well-being of the planet. Money is the INCENTIVE, in this incentive driven economy. Now why is this so important? Because MONEY, in this current ""incentive driven economy"" is NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS... ""MONEY"" is created through a process called ""fractional reserve banking"". Its supply fluctuates with changes in the interest rate, set by central banks. When you fuck with the money, you fuck with the incentives, and you fuck with the entire economic machine... 

The ""business cycle"" is an artificial anomaly CAUSED by fluctuations in the money supply... One day money is plentiful, the next day it is scarce, and businesses are failing. The NATURAL development of economies is steady and exponential: businesses create products, sell them, make a profit, and, if they have enough, they will invest that profit into new technology and products to lower production costs and make more profit, and so on... With the BUSINESS CYCLE, the rug is swept out from under these businesses on a regular basis...

In the late 1800's, Nikola Telsa invented the electric induction motor. Shortly after, he stuck one in the hub of a wheel and made the first electric car... Why, over 100 years later, are we JUST NOW seeing electric cars come to market? Because the business cycle has swept the rug out from under companies before they could make enough profit to invest in bringing that technology to the market... Nikola Tesla also invented technology to harness electricity from the ambient field of energy that everything exists in. Why are major energy providers still burning coal to generate electricity? Because the BUSINESS CYCLE has over and over ""swept the rug out from under businesses"", keeping them from being able to generate enough profit to explore other options...

There are a LOT of intricacies that occur with ""the business cycle"", or more easily; ""fucking with the incentives""...

There is false prosperity. There are loans taken out when interest rates are low, spent on ""development"": cutting down forests, and allocating resources, in expectation they can make a profit, only to have the rug swept out from under them, default on the loan, and have the entire ""development"" be a waste, leaving you with ""cut down forestry and wasted resources""... There is lowered demand side competition when money becomes abundant, due to low interest rates, and consistent borrowing, which allows companies to make ""less than quality goods"", maybe even ""meant to break"", and still have people buy them (if not buy them ""multiple times""...) There is what happens during a shift from ""a lot of money"" to ""not a lot of money' (businesses fail when prices try to adjust to the new, lower money supply), and what happens during a shift from ""not a lot of money"" to a lot (people borrow money and buy up resources at prices adjusted to ""not a lot of money""...) There is what happens when people and companies are ""desperate for money"", trying to survive the unnatural behavior of an economy with manipulated incentives (people might ""kill rhinos for their tusks"", companies might ""cut corners"" on safety and cleanliness, people might ""become soldiers and kill, just to keep some food on the table""...) The effects are evident, and they are all caused by this ""economic machine"" being manipulated by ""money changers"". When the incentives of this machine are tampered with, it runs wild... And this machine, armed with 7,000,000,000 + people, and technology out the wazoo, is not something we can afford let ""run wild""... 

Like I said before: there is no amount of ""counter-action"" that can be taken to undo all of the damage that this machine running wild can do. Its just not practical. People are just trying to survive, and doing what they HAVE TO DO, in this economy to survive. They HAVE to cut corners. in certain cases, or they will go under... This has EVERYTHING to do with our current ""environmental crisis""... Can I blame a Saudi Prince for taking advantage of his economic opportunity, and exploiting the oil resources in his country? Im not sure I can, because if he didn't do what he did, he might go under... What needs to happen is the MACHINE needs to be fixed; fixed to a point of PROPER technological development, so we can watch the NATURAL ""business cycle"" do its magic, and allow businesses to bring new technology to the market (again: sell a product, make a profit, invest that profit into new products and technology to lower production costs and make more profit). When resources are low, prices NATURALLY go up, which causes the market to ""search for alternatives"". When banks can create credit, and hand it out to anybody who asks, INFLATION and the rate that the economy adjusts to said inflation, can outpace increase in prices due to the scarcity of said resource, leading to the exploitation of natural resources, so long as the influx of money continues... 

The economy is a MACHINE... Its is an INCENTIVE DRIVEN ""MACHINE""... If we allow the incentives to go crazy (money), the machine goes crazy, and with 7,000,000,000 + people, and more and more technology coming out, everyday, this is not something we can afford... Our lives depend on it...
