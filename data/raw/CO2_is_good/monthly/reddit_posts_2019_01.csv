"ajs3vs","climatechange","action-oriented","Friend Suggests Man-Made Change Made Suspect BECAUSE of Goaddard Study -- Can someone help?","Conversation/debate I had -- To me, someone who has a decent grasp of the scientific method, this is splitting hairs or throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  This person suggests that because the CO2 output and temperature increase were wrong -- this casts enough doubt to reasonably say that ""we dont know if man is influenceing climate change""  - can someone above my paygrade help educate me?  His post is as follows ----  ""Here, let me get you started:
Hansen, J., I. Fung, A. Lacis, D. Rind, S. Lebedeff, R. Ruedy, G. Russell, and P. Stone, 1988: Global climate changes as forecast by Goddard Institute for Space Studies three-dimensional model. J. Geophys. Res., 93, 9341-9364.
This, in fact, is the study, which hooked me. Hansen's testimony to Congress the following year had me on the bandwagon.
These 8 scientists processed data of CO2, CH4, H2O, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and stratospheric aerosols from 1958 to the mid-1980's then ran three scenarios for future predictions, based on the trends they uncovered.
Scenario B was (up through 2011) pretty damn near accurate.
It overestimated warming by about 25% against what actually came to happen, but that is still pretty damn good, even though it underestimated the amount of CO2, in the atmosphere from what he projected might occur in Scenario B (which he termed ""business as usual"").
In 1950, we were pumping about 6 gigatonnes into the atmosphere; in 1960 about 9.5 gigatonnes; 1970, about 15 gigatonnes; by 1980 about 19.5 gigatonnes -- at the time Hansen et al. published their study, we were at 21.8 gigatonnes ... that's an avg increase of approx. .416 gigatonnes annum.
By 1990 we were at 22.3 gigatonnes; by 2000, were up to 24.7 gigatonnes and up to 33.5 gigatonnes by 2010, by 2013, we were at 35.84 gigatonnes -- that's an average of .589 million tonnes annum.
In layman's terms, we increased our CO2 dumping by almost 30% in the last 20 years over the previous 30 years, and yet temperature increases proved 25% lower than projected in the study.
No subsequent study has dislodged this very basic math -- let me reword that. No subsequent study by **NASA*** has dislodged this basic math.
Model 102 IPCC CMIP-5, for example, predicted temperature increases, based on the tonnage listed above, on average should be .4 degrees C warmer than they are.
This *suggests* the Earth's Climate is nowhere near as sensitive to CO2 saturation as we once once thought, which takes me full circle back to my very first point ... anthropogenic climate change is NOT settled science.""","2019-01-25 18:39:28","12","30","0.74","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ajs3vs/friend_suggests_manmade_change_made_suspect/","True","PSadair","1747906789.2821307","CO2 is good","manual"

I read on Skeptical Science that they estimate it takes 35-40 years for the ocean to incorporate 60% of the heat associated with a new elevated GHG level. 

Using CO2 as a proxy, My strawman is that the we're experiencing the heat consequences of ~ 360 ppm today. That's about 30% above the pre-industrial peak of 280 ppm. 

Gazing into the future, it's increasingly difficult to imagine that we don't hit at least 500 ppm before leveling off. That would be another 40% above the level I'm suggesting we feel today. 

Lot's of things coming into the future that I can""t foresee and many variables.

I'm just trying to make the case that all things being equal, today's experience of +1C is about halfway to what would be considered a good result in many quarters.

"acchit","climatechange","action-oriented","Looking for sources on the role of water in climate change","I'm looking for sources and mechanisms for the ""runaway"" part of global warming. Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lasting greenhouse gas, and as I understand it, the CO2 is supposed to warm the planet slightly and increase atmospheric water vapor which heats the planet and increases atmospheric water vapor further which then runs away until the portion of the emission spectrum covered by water vapor approaches the saturation point.

If I've gotten any part of this wrong, feel free to correct me, (I welcome it, actually.) but I'm looking for good sources on any of the following

 * anticipated rates of cloud formation
 * climate-sensitive uptake of water by the biosphere
 * expected contributions of evapotranspiration from increased plant growth
 * anticipated evaporation effects caused by a temporary cooling of the upper-most layers of the ocean from ice melt
 * anticipated change in the altitude of the troposphere due to increased heating
 * anything else you may have heard of

"abi9ul","environment","emotional","My observations of why climate change is a scam","Short: I think global warming is not of humans cause but pollution and other environmental damages are and cause problems\*

1: the 15/16 biggest ships in the world make more pollution than all cars on the planet together. who has to pay emission taxes? only cars. people struggle with it all the time, do factories, ship industries, farm and cattle owners (cow's emit methane if the sources are true) and manufactures protest about heavy burdens of emission tax on them? no. the 20 - 80 idea also applies here, but ofc the state will benefit taxing from the 80% majority which only creates 20% of the pollution. Just to mention fireworks and black powder also create huge amounts of CO2, I've even read its more than cars alone but that's only one source and I wont be sure of yet personally.

&#x200B;

2: how polluting are the cars today? not that much! the Porsche car 911 and Volvo cars are a great example. you can also experience it directly, go in a big city of any developed or even semi developed country, you can simply walk beside a high way or streets and don't feel much emissions by smelling and your senses. And keep in mind thats only one tiny portion of the whole planet area which is this heavily urbanized and of coarse you don't see pollution in bare naked nature and the oceans. Yes you will feel so disgusted in Asian big cities from the pollution since its so high but its not only caused by cars, Asia has many polluting industries and coal usage in contrast to Europe and USA. they also have less nuclear power, renewable energy and etc which is why countries like China, Iran and more are so polluted and from my 11 years of living in Iran I see that the state simply doesn't care because they have other agenda's which are another topic. So its the industry and cars are a tiny portion.

&#x200B;

3: Volcanic activities and fires create way way much more emissions and CO2 than human industry. it has always been like that, in fact our best understanding of why dinosaurs went extinct is because of huge clouds dust caused from volcano's blocked sunlight and the earth simply perished and only a few reptiles stayed alive to this day like the crocodile.

&#x200B;

4: The most important point: Ice age fluctuations. Every couple of dozen thousand years temperatures rise and decline and currently we are in the rising period which will be followed by an ice age in estimated 1500 years. the two last links bellow are about Ice ages. final word, human effect on global warming is so small that its ridiculous to claim its our fault but pollution, deforestation and such similar environmental problems are definitely human caused and concerning. Don't judge so fast on climate change like everyone. its more complex than that

&#x200B;

P.S I also used to believe in global warming as how the media portrays until couple months ago. There is so much more lies we are living in from History to Culture. I've read articles with different graphs before and these I've watched resonate with them.

"afdakl","environment","emotional","16 Sustainability Leaders Weigh In: How YOU Can Help To Reverse Global Warming","Fellow humans who care about life on Earth!

&#x200B;

I just spent months putting this article together and think it's incredibly useful, so I wanted to share.

16 sustainability and climate experts answer the following question, ""What is the most effective thing that someone can do to help reverse global warming?""

(Bill McKibben, Katharine Hayhoe, James Hansen, Gina McCarthy to name a few)

Here are the main takeaways for those that don't want to read it all:

* **Speak up – break that climate silence!** Talk to the people you know about climate change and why it’s important to you. If we’re not talking about it, people don’t care. If people don’t care, we’ll never take action.
* **Get the right people to represent us in government.** How? Vote for climate champions. And do what you can to help them win.
* **Hold your existing representatives accountable.** Push for climate policies that are in line with what the science demands, not what is “politically feasible”. Bills for ***carbon pricing*** and initiatives like the ***Green New Deal*** are excellent. (remember we need to cut global emissions in half by 2030 and be net zero by 2050)
* **Organize with others. Join a movement!** As Bill McKibben said, “Movements are, history would indicate, the one way we have of standing up to unjust, entrenched power.”

The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price) to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Many nations [have already started pricing carbon](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y), though [in general the prices adopted are too low](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emissions-prices/global-schemes-to-price-co2-emissions-worth-82-billion-world-bank-idUSKCN1IN0Z9), and a few important players are lagging behind entirely. The good news is **we are making real progress**. [Canada recently passed a Carbon Fee & Dividend bill](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/canada-adopts-carbon-fee-and-dividend-to-rein-in-climate-change/) that looks very much like what Citizens' Climate Lobby volunteers have been pushing for for years, and the [U.S. House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/7173) and [Senate](https://www.coons.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sens-coons-flake-introduce-landmark-bipartisan-legislation-to-put-money-in-the-pockets-of-working-families-by-pricing-carbon-pollution) both introduced nearly identical [Carbon Fee & Dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_and_dividend) bills last month that [also closely match what CCL has been pushing for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK3rsWWCgi0).

I've been lobbying Congress for a few years now, and here are some of the things I've done:

* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's a short training on How to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/media-training/print-media/writing-effective-letters-to-the-editor/) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  

* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). 

* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.

* At my request, 4 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. 

* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. We're still awaiting a vote, but things are looking hopeful, with several council members already committed to support. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). 

* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. 

* I gave two presentations to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee & Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for.

* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously ""Safe Passage""](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)

* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee & Dividend and try to get their support.

Carbon Engineering and a group of Harvard scientists have come up with a way to cheaply remove CO2 from the atmosphere, $94-$232 per ton.  With a small plant in British Columbia they've already proven they can do it.  Similar to a paper mill, the CO2 undergoes a chemical process to remove it from a carbonate solution.  Then the CO2 is combined with hydrogen and made into liquid fuels.  This would eliminate the need to continue extracting fossil fuels from the ground and create carbon-neutral fuels.

&#x200B;

Not satisfied with the Green New Deal's overly ambitious goal of 100% renewable energy and skeptical of the proposed ""market based"" solution in the House right now, I think this new technology is where we should be focusing our money and efforts.  Our lifestyles won't need to change if this works, we wont' crash the economy with burdensome fees or taxes, and we won't be running the risk of tying the EPA's hands for ten years on enacting new regulations on carbon emissions if emissions fail to meet target levels.  Though electric cars have promise, as of yet they haven't come down in price enough to be a mass market solution, and there still aren't enough charging stations.  Our country is too big and spread out to ever serve people adequately with mass transit alone.  We're a nation that needs cars.

&#x200B;

This same company may even be able to sequester CO2 in the ground, another possible way to put our tax dollars to good use.

"alnrte","collapse","skeptical","Some numbers to think about","One of the things I see a lot on the internet is how the average westerner pollutes more than those in third world countries. This is undoubtedly true. However, I haven't seen any breakdown on what the emissions distribution actually looks like; that is, who is responsible for the lion's share of carbon emissions? Since we have such an unequal wealth distribution, if the correlation between the cost of a good and the CO2 emitted when making it is even close to linear, we might also find that the wealthiest people are responsible for a much larger chunk of emissions than they're prepared to admit.

Case in point: Elon Musk.

According to [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/elon-musks-highflying-2018-what-150000-miles-in-a-private-jet-reveal-about-his-excruciating-year/2019/01/29/83b5604e-20ee-11e9-8b59-0a28f2191131_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_source=reddit.com&utm_term=.5837a6dbb6cb) site, Elon traveled 150,000 miles in his corporate jet last year. Let's go through some math and break this down.

150,000 miles is 241,041 kilometers. Let's assume that his jet outputs 3 MW constantly (I'm assuming two ~10-15 MW engines at cruise here), and flies at Mach 0.97 at an altitude of 45,000 ft. This gives us 286.247 m/s, with a total time in the air of 234 hours. Yikes.

Assuming ideal efficiency, it would take 2.53E12 J of energy to cover this distance at this speed, but we'll say the engines are 50% efficient, so double that. Jet fuel has a mass-specific energy of ~44.5E6 J/kg, which gives me roughly 113,000 kg of Jet A1 burned. From here, 1 g of jet fuel releases roughly 3.1 g of carbon dioxide when it's burned, which gives us ~351,000 kg of CO2 released.

Okay, so how does this stack up against an ordinary person? Well, an average Australian emits 20 tonnes of CO2 over the course of a year, which means Elon's jet used the equivalent of 17 years of basic consumption for an ordinary Australian. But! The average person emits that over the course of a year. Elon only flies 234 hours in a year. Accounting for this, Elon actually emitted CO2 at a rate 637 times the average during his private jet commutes. And that's just by comparison to a westerner. Compare that to someone in the developing world, and you're likely looking at five times that figure.

Now, granted, Elon's is a particularly egregious example. That said, I think it's worthwhile examining the lifestyles of the wealthiest among us to get an understanding of how wealth effects emissions, and how this effect scales. I mean, it seems a bit hypocritical for a bunch of billionaires to fly into Davos, and then start preaching about climate change. I think they're exactly the people that need to be looked at.","2019-01-31 09:19:46","177","66","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/alnrte/some_numbers_to_think_about/","True","FluidCourage","1747907328.650242","CO2 is good","manual"
