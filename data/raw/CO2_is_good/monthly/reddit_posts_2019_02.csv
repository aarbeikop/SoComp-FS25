"alw8h9","climatechange","action-oriented","My dad strongly denies climate change has any noticeable effect on the world, not sure where to get started with all this","My dad is far right leaning and he's been trying to convince me that climate change is not something we need to worry about. He's 70, I'm 27, so I'm naturally on the opposite side and I believe we need to be concerned with the amount of CO2 we're putting out. I'm not great at debating so I mostly only have feelings and not facts. I know a lot of scientists recently got together and warned the government about climate change, I know a massive majority of scientists are concerned about climate change, etc, but I don't know lots of good specifics. My dad listens to radio stations like Hannity and watches Fox, if I had to guess, probably around two hours every day if not more. He is REALLY certain that he is in the right, and when trying to convince me that he's right he will go on to explain how information is being twisted and it's all being done so the government can tax people etc.

It would be nice if I could change his mind, but I don't expect that to be a realistic goal. He's old, he's going to believe in what he believes in, and I'm okay with that. I mostly just want a better understanding for myself since he's actively trying to gaslight me (I'm in close quarters doing work with him most days lately).

Out of curiosity, I asked him if I could see his sources. He gladly said he would email them to me. I thought I would get some obscure alternative science sources, but I got one singular source from [Fox Fucking News, linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA5sGtj7QKQ) The guy's name is Dr. Patrick Michaels, not sure if that name sounds familiar to anyone.

I don't know if this is relevant since it's about 5 years old now but I recently reviewed [Veritasium's video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIU) and I agree with most of the points he's laid out. I'm taking lots of this with grains of salt: 

I'm not taking either video as an absolute truth of course, just wanted to see where he was coming from. I really don't trust Fox, and to a large extent I don't trust most mainstream news either. I don't even trust myself and I'm not sure I can trust reddit at this point. Obviously if I'm posting on the climatechange subreddit it's going to favor younger people who believe climate change is a real danger, so I don't know sometimes if the information I'm getting is biased or if there is real truth to what I'm reading. I worry that I'm so scared of things being Fake News that I just end up rejecting everything I'm given sometimes. 

Basically, I don't know where to even start with something as complicated as this, was wondering if anyone could point me in the right (IE probably correct) direction?

"av06wf","climatechange","action-oriented","Looking for information and feedback"," Global warming/climate change:  
1) Is the climate changing more rapidly than we have observed in the past 150 or so years? Seems likely.  
2) Is it caused by human intervention in the environment? It is hard to just say, ""the science"" points to yes, especially knowing first-hand, that there is an extreme amount of bias and subjectivity in drawing conclusions in any scientific study. That is precisely why we do not depend indefinitely on a single source for any cutting edge result. Additionally, there is so much liberal bias in the scientific community, how can one distinguish what is subjective fact and a completely biased interpretation of results (especially when not being an expert yourself)? There is something extremely pretentious and presumptuous in a belief such as this.   
Having said that, could the deforestation and air pollutants created by industrialization of humans be a culprit or contributor? Certainly. Has literally any scientific study thoroughly assessed the possibility this is due to one of many, many astronomical perturbations of Earth's non-nominal rotation, oblateness, not-perfectly-elliptical and variably perturbed orbit, or effects of other celestial objects (ex. the Moon, Jupiter, potentially undiscovered objects in the LaGrange points of the Earth-Sun or Earth Moon systems, etc.)? Some mention astronomical effects very briefly (the most I have found is a single sentence that immediately rules this out as a possibility), but I have a very deep suspicion that they were not very thorough investigations. So as far as I have read, these things have not been addressed, and if you have anything to say otherwise, please share. My goal is to educate myself and make my own judgement call, not to blindly accept some biased researchers' opinion.  
3) Is this a bad thing? Will there be doom and gloom as a result? Many die from cold temperatures every year. As less do, the argument is that more will die from more extreme heat or other effects of climate change. Seems debatable. Nothing I have read has convinced me of deaths from heat alone being a major issue - especially in light of the drastic reduction in cold-related deaths. Will there be ""new normal"" extremes in weather patterns? We cannot even accurately predict the weather. What makes us believe these same models can somehow be more accurate over decades? Many studies are actively debating this exact thing and the jury is still out as far as I can tell. Is this sensationalism to get more research funding? Or sensationalism to get more votes/support from constituencies? Those seems much more likely than the former.  
4) Should the US be the primary entity held responsible for changing it? I strongly believe that it is quite naive and overstates our ability, let alone to even begin to understand how to positively influence a trend in such a complex system as the global environment. I mean, we cannot even predict the weather correctly (See any major snow/storm announcement in Northern Alabama in the last 6 years as an easy, albeit anecdotal example of this).   
Additionally, how can we rule out that this is not just a ploy for self-aggrandizement for the political left? When you have industrializing nations such as China and India with orders of magnitude greater populations pumping the largest amounts of pollution into the air, this seems unreasonable to put on the US's shoulders. I believe we have come quite a long way in the last 30 to 40 years and have a very acceptable amount of environmental protection in place. At some point, you get greatly diminished returns, especially when we are not even close to the primary polluters of the world.  
5) Is this a good thing? Since we will reduce the number of people dying from extreme cold, that certainly is not bad. Will an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to any other negative effects on the environment at large? The things that I have read here say things like, ""the increase in algae will cause a massive die-off of coral reefs and other sea life"". These are complex systems that DO NOT exist in isolation. When one creature or plant thrives, others sometimes take advantage of this. How do we know that animals that thrive on algae will not proportionally grow to accommodate the new source of sustenance? Can anyone say for certain that would not be the case? My limited biology background gives me the intuition that more carbon dioxide means more fuel for plant growth, which is a good thing, if we want more plants. With all of the deforestation humanity has brought about, wouldn't more lush and plentiful plant-life be a good swing in the right direction? Also, less cold globally means less need for man-made heat, i.e. reduced power needs and therefore less carbon emissions. That is also a good thing.   
Can anyone give me any other points on this or actual scientific research (not just articles written by biased journalists that think they are scientists, etc.)?","2019-02-26 14:44:18","1","10","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/av06wf/looking_for_information_and_feedback/","True","sekkou527","1747907680.9273162","CO2 is good","manual"

"ar25su","environment","emotional","Please give an argument againt: ""Nuclear is clean energy, and nuclear waste is a non-problem""","Over the past few years I've heard a lot of good things about nuclear energy, specifically using Thorium 232 instead of Uranium, but it seems like most people are still against it and I don't really know why.

My understanding is as follows:

* Nuclear fission produces zero greenhouse gases directly
* In total, including manufacturing and logistics etc, nuclear energy causes less CO2-equivalent emissions per kWh than even photovoltaic solar, and just about anything else that has the potential to provide the whole world's power
* PV-solar is the energy form with the highest CO2-equivalent emissions per kWh after natural gas and coal, which is due to the manufacturing process
* Nuclear energy is the safest form of energy, with US nuclear killing \~2,000,000 times less people per kWh than China coal power, and even \~50x less people per kWh than solar (somehow)
* Nuclear waste doesn't actually hurt anybody in anyway as long as you aren't close to it, as nuclear radiation is simply high energy particles just like a lightbulb would emit and becomes negligible due to the inverse square relation
* Thorium 232 fuel cycle uses a much greater percentage of the fuel than uranium and would reduce the problem of waste
* Nuclear waste as an issue could be easily dealt with by simply burying it several meters below the ground, perhaps in a mountain far away from society
* The only two real meltdowns of nuclear plants ever have been Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi, which ended up killing a total of 25 and 0 people, respectively
* Most people have a negative view of nuclear energy because of the terrible events following nuclear weapons testing, and an accidental correlation of nuclear weapons testing and nuclear energy
* Most countries are actively trying to get rid of their nuclear energy and I don't know why

The combination of these understandings leads me to believe that nuclear is the ideal solution over something like photovoltaic solar, and that for some strange reason there seems to be a large movement spreading misinformation to the general population.

*Edit: furthermore, not only does it seem like the ideal solution, but it seems like it would only take 5x or 10x as many nuclear plants as we have now to power the entire planet, and this seems very doable.*

&#x200B;

Can somebody please let me know if there is any evidence against these understandings? Are we missing something important that makes nuclear less ideal than solar for the future? Is it simply too expensive to build nuclear plants? Are there any new solar technologies in the works which will reduce the high relative pollution of solar panels as compared to other forms of clean energy?

I would really love for anybody to poke some holes in the argument above and prove any of those points wrong, because I am really confused as to why it seems like both the fossil fuel people and environmentalists are both trying to get rid of nuclear. It seems like the best of both worlds.

Thank you so very much if you read all of this, I know it's a bit messy.

"amttvf","environment","emotional","The True Terror of Climate Change: Part 1","Intro:

&#x200B;

This isn’t something I take some sort of arrogant self-satisfaction in writing. In truth it is the most depressing thing I’ve ever typed out in my drawn-out youth of half-baked high-school poetry and pandering college essays. I’m writing this because I’m frustrated. I’m frustrated by a combination of two traditional narratives I often see in regards to discussing the impending ecological collapse we typically refer to as ""climate change"". The first is that there is hope to maintain the current state of things, always of the “just enough time to act” variety, and the follow-up assumption that seems to come with that is that communicating any sense of impending “doom” or “hopelessness” will dissuade people from trying to mitigate the disaster. Articles such as the following convey this attitude (and I hope to respond directly to this article soon) - [http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/](http://time.com/4731632/climate-change-2020-trump/)

Personally I don’t buy into either of these narratives. The following writing, however short or long it becomes, will seek to address these narratives while simultaneously revealing a more concrete truth buried within them both. 

&#x200B;

Part 1: The Problem: 

&#x200B;

Before we go into things like the politics or response efforts to climate change (and the wider issues of ecological collapse), let’s take some time to just examine the problem itself. In this section, we will look solely at the challenges facing the global atmosphere, how that ties into the biosphere, and the nature of the problems confronting both the natural world and wider human society. 

For most people, the entry point for understanding the environmental problems as a cohesive global issue comes from being introduced to climate change. The basic premise introduced is simple: humans are emitting CO2 in the form of fossil fuel consumption, that emission of CO2 is changing (warming) the climate, and that given a long enough scale, this problem will fundamentally reshape things like coastal communities or the ability to maintain agriculture.

Many see this as the end of the journey in understanding climate change. It present a clear issue, gives it a name, describes it in an elevator-speech type format, and provides a paradoxically simple yet complex solution to solving it: Humanity must emit less CO2 over time to avoid changing the climate too radically in order to maintain the status quo of the industrialized modern world. 

Unfortunately, this narrative is intensely limited. For example, it doesn’t touch on the idea that humanity emits a multitude of gasses into the atmosphere, many of which trap far more heat than CO2.

The factory farm system has added millions of bovine to the surface of the Earth that simply didn’t exist before, and the nature of decomposing societal waste in the form of landfills is also a modern creation of the past century. Both of these processes emit an enormous amount of Methane. This is important to note because Methane actually traps 100 times as much gas as CO2 in its first year of introduction, and retains roughly 72 times the amount of heat after 5 years. There is something to be said for the fact the Methane tends to dissipate from the atmosphere after 10 years, but its ability to accumulate over that time and our continued increase of its production has largely outpaced this dissipation. - [http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/methane-vs-carbon-dioxide-a-greenhouse-gas-showdown/) 

(how factory farming adds to climate change.) - [https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html](https://www.ecowatch.com/how-factory-farming-contributes-to-global-warming-1881690535.html)

Yet even with this understanding the severity of something as simple as 1 additional chemical is downplayed. Since methane tends to be seen as more of a “burst” of heating as opposed to the “sustained” heating CO2 leads to, there is an instinct to see it as less of a threat, or at least as less of an enduring one. What this ignores however is the nature of how this type of short-term burst of heating adds to the wider cycle of climate change. 

As Methane adds to the heating cycle, it gives a boost to the melting of arctic and sub-arctic permafrost in the regions of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Russia’s Siberia. This permafrost itself contains an unknowable amount of gasses, all trapped within the once permanently frozen areas of those regions. As these areas are thawed for the first time in 1000’s of years, they release the CO2 and methane stored beneath, thus accelerating the warming cycle in a way that is outside of human influence or control. The problem is pervasive enough that scientists continue to show larger-than-expected amounts of these gasses being released into the atmosphere from this process. - [https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-permafrost-methane.html)

This process gives us an introduction to the wider problem of climate change, which is the nature of its intersectionality with the wider crises facing the World’s ecosystems. Still, taken in this view the common perspective often looks to the atmosphere itself as the source of both the problem and the solution. A deeper look shows how other environmental problems tie into this process. 

Let’s take de-forestation as an example. It is no surprise to anyone who passed 3rd grade science that plants take in CO2 emitted by humans and other animals, and that they in-turn release oxygen for our consumption. This understanding leads us to a natural conclusion: the more trees we have on the planet, the better we’ll be able to regulate the escalation of gasses like CO2 and Methane. Indeed, scientists have said for a long time that the global forest systems are the best means for mitigating climate change. - [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-best-technology-for-fighting-climate-change-isnt-a-technology/)

Unfortunately, looking into the rate of deforestation itself will show that we are only adding to the problem by clearing these necessary ecosystems, rather than helping to mitigate the disaster by protecting them. The amazon rainforest is perhaps the best example. Often referred to as “the world’s lungs”, it is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the planet, and is responsible for 20% of all the oxygen inhaled by every living creature on the planet. 

Despite the overwhelming importance of this region, its destruction has gone largely unchecked, ironically pushed to exploit resources that add heat to the atmosphere or for the clearing of land for industrial farming. The fact that Brazil recently elected Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier (liar) who has promised to increase rainforest “development” and shifted control of the region from the country’s environmental agency to its agricultural one, shows that this problem has little chance of slowing. - [http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/](http://www.humanosphere.org/environment/2016/07/brazils-rising-deforestation-rate-shows-reversal-environmental-progress/)

(Bolsonaro transfers power over the rainforest to agricultural ministry.) - [https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land](https://www.agcanada.com/daily/bolsonaro-gives-brazil-farm-ministry-powers-on-indigenous-land)

One could be forgiven for hoping that forest protection efforts or re-forestation efforts might help make up some of this difference. Depressingly though, this is not the case. The largest bio-spheres of the planet with the largest areas of forest cover have experienced massive forest lost since 2001 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, lost 12 million hectares of forest cover in that 16 year period, with their single highest year of loss being 2017 itself at 1,470,000 hectares in a single year. For perspective, the total area of Michigan is 25,049,329 hectares. This means that the Democratic Republic of Congo alone has cleared an area of forest almost half the size of the entire state of Michigan in less time than it takes a human being to go from infancy to high-school graduation. Taken in conjunction with forest loss in other countries, the situation’s urgency begins to reveal itself. - [https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map) 

Still, not even this combination of factors is able to show the true all-encompassing nature of the environmental catastrophe we now find ourselves living through. To gain a wider picture of the problem, we should look beyond our own visible atmosphere and turn to the other 2/3rds of our planet: The Oceans. 

The World’s oceans absorb 35 - 42% of all CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, and over 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming. Their importance in mitigating and understanding climate change, and the nature of change that the warming climate will have on these ecosystems, cannot be understated. - [https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2012/01/24/warming-oceans-face-co2-tipping-point/)

This absorption has already begun to affect the oceans, despite the system taking about 20 - 40 years to fully react to the change. This delayed reaction means that, even if humans were to discontinue all CO2 emission today, the oceans would continue to change as a result of global warming for decades beyond that end. This is known as “The thermal intertia of the oceans.” - [https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html](https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html)

The nature of the change which has already taken place has been massively negative. Coral reefs have begun bleaching far more often than in previous decades. While bleaching events are a natural process, their increased rate means the reefs don’t have time to recover as part of the natural cycle, leading to massive die-offs of these “underwater forests” from regions such as the Great Barrier Reef. Naturally, this destruction removes sources of food for important parts of the marine ecosystem and adds to the global ecosystem’s inability to effectively react to industrial human activity. - [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/08/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change/)

While the death of massive amounts of marine life is obviously catastrophic for both the planet and our dependence on the Oceans, it’s not even the only story tied into the Oceans when it comes to climate change. Another effect is seen when we look at ocean currents, which are slowing and causing changes to weather patterns already. Indeed, global climate scientists have begun to ask whether the entire Ocean current system could “stall.” Since these currents help to power and carry everything from necessary rain patterns to hurricanes and cyclones, a change in these systems would have massive effects on human life. In fact, when hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, the national weather service had to add a new color to their radar mapping system simply so they could accurately track the amount of water being dumped on the State. They had never needed to measure rain in that amount in that region in the modern history of weather analysis. - [https://e360.yale.edu/features/will\_climate\_change\_jam\_the\_global\_ocean\_conveyor\_belt](https://e360.yale.edu/features/will_climate_change_jam_the_global_ocean_conveyor_belt)

Hurricane Harvey color added: - [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/28/546776542/national-weather-service-adds-new-colors-so-it-can-map-harveys-rains)

Taken in conjunction with these problems, let’s finish by looking at how climate change can affect global weather patterns. While the hurricane example above is a good example to show how the change in the oceans from climate change helps propel a change in the weather, even this link is not a full view of the intersectionality which climate change represents. 

Perhaps the greatest immediate threat some developing countries will experience as climate change progresses isn’t the flooding of coastal cities, but rather the restriction or even complete eradication of water sources and localized water cycles. Many nations hosting millions of people rely heavily on localized water cycles for their populations. Pakistan, for example, requires snowfall in its northern region during the winter months in order to maintain its water usage, since the melting of this snow in those same mountain regions leads to massive water runoff which itself adds to and becomes the country’s rivers. - [http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/](http://glacierhub.org/2018/02/15/glacial-retreat-water-impacts/) 

This means that, should those regions warm to a point where that snowfall is extremely hindered or halted all together (as is widely predicted), the country would be left with an unknowable loss in water supply for its population of millions. Add to this the prediction that overall rainfall throughout the country is expected to decrease simultaneously with this loss of the glacial melting cycle, and you begin to paint a painfully dire portrait. - [https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change](https://www.geo.tv/latest/144615-pakistan-facing-worst-effects-of-climate-change)

More on Pakistan: - [https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/](https://tribune.com.pk/story/682012/impact-of-climate-change-in-pakistan/)

This combination of diminishing rainfall and glacial runoff isn’t unique to Pakistan. India, the world’s most populous nation, is expected to feel many of the same effects. Additionally, the major rivers leading into China and Southeast Asia are largely sourced from Tibet and the Himalayas, an area of incredibly high mountains and sprawling natural glaciers. The Mekong river, the Yangtze, and many others find their source in this central region of the Asian continent. Yet the fate of those rivers and their water sources are cast into doubt as climate change hammers away at Tibet and drains the region of this naturally recurring and utterly necessary cycle. - [https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html](https://tibet-edd.blogspot.com/2012/03/tibet-and-climate-change-whats.html) 

So where does that leave us? Well, hopefully this shows the impending nature of the climate catastrophe. Climate Change is not some vague idea or one that has limited effects, it is both propelled by and propelling countless other changes within systems that are vital to both human and ecological survival. Failing to understand the grand nature of this problem, its immediacy, and it intersectional elements has allowed cognitive dissonance around the issue to flourish. In order to move forward with even the most basic amount of optimism, we must confront the reality of what is happening, rather than seeking to downplay it in order to attract wider attention to the issue.

This urgency should be the engine to gain that wider attention.

The animal ag industry has redoubled their efforts to confuse us about the huge impact our meat habit has on global greenhouse gasses and global warming. But the evidence is undeniable - animal agriculture is a huge part of the global warming threat.

&#x200B;

How one calculates the impact of an industry on global warming depends on how the industry is defined. If you want to do an honest accounting, you will include all the inputs in the total contribution - both direct and indirect emmissions. If forests are cleared to graze cattle, or if corn is grown to feed hogs than obviously these are key components of animal agriculture and should be part of the total calculation. 

&#x200B;

This is precisely what the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) did when they researched the animal ag industry for their report - “Livestock’s Long Shadow” in 2006. Unfortunately they did not have comparable data on the emissions produced by other sectors, such as the transportation sector. The source for the data - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) only measured direct emissions for these sector. So, for instance, the green house gas emissions produced by smelters making the steel for the auto bodies was not part of the calculation. As a result, the UNFAO conclusion that animal agriculture contributed 18% of all global warming gasses somewhat overstated the impact of animal agriculture on climate change.

&#x200B;

Of course the meat industry was quick to point out the descrepency. And it’s not surprising that they went much further - stating the UNFAO findings were “false” and “disproven”, even though those are not correct critiques of the report. The meat industry prefers to quote the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s statistic that states animal agriculture only accounts for 3.9% of total US green house gas emmissions. But the EPA numbers dont calculate indirect factors such as the fertilizer used to grow the crops that feed the animals, or the forests cleared to graze the animals, or the trucks that carry the hogs to be slaughtered.

&#x200B;

So while the EPA numbers are accurate, they are not complete. In the EPA model the trucks used to haul hogs to slaughter would fall into the transportation sector, for example. But obviously, without the demand for meat, the trucks wouldn’t be driving hogs to market!

&#x200B;

Since then, the UNFAO released a new report with updated data that uses new guidelines from the IPCC. Sadly - for the planet as well as for the meat industry - this new report’s senior author concludes, ""The absolute volume of emissions is very similar to \[the\] 2006 \[report\], even with the revised framework,"" (1) Only the overall pre cent contribution was reduced, from 18% to 14.5%.

&#x200B;

This is not good news for the meat industry, but it is a more complete and honest accounting of meat’s impact on our planet.

&#x200B;

“All told, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with livestock supply chains add up to 7.1 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) per year – or 14.5 percent of all human-caused GHG releases.

&#x200B;

According to the new UNFAO report, the main sources of emissions in animal ag are: feed production and processing (45 percent of the total), outputs of GHG during digestion by cows (39 percent), and manure decomposition (10 percent). The remainder is attributable to the processing and transportation of animal products.” (2)

&#x200B;

The new figure - 14.5% - is not what the industry wanted to hear. So they are downplaying it or talking around it. Or more likely, harking back to the EPA’s smaller figure with it’s incomplete accounting.

&#x200B;

The new FAO report emphasizes the potential for animal agriculture to reduce it’s  global warming footprint. And no doubt there is huge area for improvement. But its not at all likely to happen. In areas where animal ag is big, they exert pressure on local governments to remain completely hands off. Any attempt to hold the industry accountable for the pollution, cruelty, and disease it produces is met with staunch resistance. As an example, research done at University of Iowa on voluntary efforts to reduce nutrient runoff from farm fields has shown pollution has actually increased since the voluntary program began.

&#x200B;

In fact, one thing the animal ag industry and those who study it agree on is that meat production and consumption will grow rapidly for decades to come. So the numbers they are quoting today, regardless of their source, are sure to increase. Meantime industries like transport are meeting consumer demand for more fuel efficient cars by using alternative, green technolgies. 

&#x200B;

And while consumption of meat has slowed in developed countries, the increase in meat consumption in many other areas of the world is growing rapidly. 

&#x200B;

The global impact of animal agriculture will rapidly rise if we don’t curtail our desire to consume animal flesh.

So this is from *The Guardian*, which can normally be relied upon to push the ""It is all the fault of the rich Westerners, the Third world people are environmental saints"" narrative. A narrative that is also very popular around here and among pretty much everyone who prefers to live in a delusion and does not want to face the reality of the situation. Which is that we do not have a climate change crisis, we have a sustainability crisis, of which climate change is only one component, and the other components of which it is much more difficult to excuse as due to the actions of only one part of humanity. Ecosystem destruction is a prime example, and palm oil a particularly good illustration. 

Some quotes:

>With palm oil, “the reality is that the western part of world is [a small share] of palm oil consumption, and the rest of the world doesn’t give a shit”, said Neil Blomquist, managing director of Colorado-based Natural Habitats, which produces palm oil in Ecuador and Sierra Leone to the highest level of sustainability certification. “So there’s not much incentive to change.”

I've been trying to explain to various dimwits here that ""the rest of the world"" actually has much more destructive attitudes towards the environment than the ""West"", people still don't want to listen, so it is nice to see it stated so openly. 

>For all the palm oil that now goes into food in Europe and the US, Asia uses far more: India, China, and Indonesia account for nearly 40% of all palm oil consumed worldwide. Where they once cooked with soya oil, palm oil has replaced it. Growth has been fastest in India, where an accelerating economy has been another factor in palm oil’s newfound popularity.

>By 1995, Indian imports of palm oil had climbed to nearly 1m tonnes, reaching more than 9m tonnes by 2015. In those years, the poverty rate fell by half while the population climbed by 36%.

In other words, the destruction of the Indonesian forest is in quite direct relationship with population growth worldwide. Which makes sense -- rich people can burn a lot of CO2 jetting around the world and living in mansions, but they do not use more soap and shampoo and do not eat more than even the lower middle class in the developing world. So palm oil demand is driven primarily by population growth. 

>The oil palm is blessed with many attributes that have helped it on its path to dominance. It is perennial and evergreen, enabling year-round production. It is exceptionally efficient at photosynthesis for a perennial tree, and requires less preparation of the soil than other sources of vegetable oils, reducing costs. It can succeed in soils that can’t sustain other crops. Most importantly, it gives the highest yield per acre of any oilseed crop – almost five times as much oil per acre as rapeseed, almost six times as much as sunflower and more than eight times as much as soybeans. Boycotts of palm oil will only lead to its replacement by other crops needing far more farmland and likely more deforestation.

And the destruction might actually be even worse if it wasn't palm oil but something else...","2019-02-19 08:28:27","30","33","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/as86ol/how_the_world_got_hooked_on_palm_oil_and_why/","True","gkm64","1747908271.0547974","CO2 is good","manual"
