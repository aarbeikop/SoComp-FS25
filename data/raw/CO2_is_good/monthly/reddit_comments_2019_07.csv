"et8y4zo","t3_caaebk","caaebk","climatechange","action-oriented","The greening of planet Earth absorbs CO2 !!


Amid all the talk of an imminent planetary catastrophe caused by emissions of carbon dioxide, another fact is often ignored: global greening is happening faster than climate change. The amount of vegetation growing on the earth has been increasing every year for at least 30 years. The evidence comes from the growth rate of plants and from satellite data.
In 2016 a paper was published by 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries that analysed satellite data and concluded that there had been a roughly 14% increase in green vegetation over 30 years. The study attributed 70% of this increase to the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The lead author on the study, Zaichun Zhu of Beijing University, says this is equivalent to adding a new continent of green vegetation twice the size of the mainland United States.
Global greening has affected all ecosystems – from arctic tundra to coral reefs to plankton to tropical rain forests – but shows up most strongly in arid places like the Sahel region of Africa, where desertification has largely now reversed. This is because plants lose less water in the process of absorbing carbon dioxide if the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher. Ecosystems and farms will be less water-stressed at the end of this century than they are today during periods of low rainfall.
There should have been no surprise about this news. Thousands of experiments have been conducted over many years in which levels of CO2 had been increased over crops or wild ecosystems and boosted their growth. The owners of commercial greenhouses usually pump CO2 into the air to speed up the growth of plants. CO2 is plant food.
This greening is good news. It means more food for insects and deer, for elephants and mice, for fish and whales. It means higher yields for farmers; indeed, the effect has probably added about $3 trillion to farm incomes over the last 30 years. So less land is needed to feed the human population and more can be spared for wildlife instead.
Yet this never gets mentioned. In their desperation to keep the fearmongering on track the activists who make a living off the climate change scare do their best to ignore this inconvenient truth. When they cannot avoid the subject, they say that greening is a temporary phenomenon that will reverse in the latter part of this century. The evidence for this claim comes from a few models fed with extreme assumptions, so it cannot be trusted.
This biological phenomenon can also help to explain the coming and going of ice ages. It has always been a puzzle that ice ages grow gradually colder for tens of thousands of years, then suddenly warmer again in the space of a few thousand years, at which point the huge ice caps of Eurasia and North America collapse and the world enters a warmer interlude, such as the one we have been enjoying for 10,000 years.
Attempts to explain this cyclical pattern have mostly failed so far. Carbon dioxide levels track the change, but these rise after the world starts to warm and fall after the world starts to cool, so they are not the cause. Changes in the shape of the earth’s orbit play a role, with ice sheets collapsing when the northern summers are especially warm, but only some of these so-called “great summers” result in deglaciation.
Recent ice cores from the Antarctic appear to have fingered the culprit at last: it’s all about plants. During ice ages, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere steadily drops, because colder oceans absorb more of the gas. Eventually it reaches such a low level – about 0.018% at the peak of the last ice age – that plants struggle to grow at all, especially in dry areas or at high altitudes. As a result gigantic dust storms blanket the entire planet, reaching even Antarctica, where the amount of dust in the ice spikes dramatically upward. These dust storms blacken the northern ice sheets in particular, making them highly vulnerable to rapid melting when the next great summer arrives. The ice age was a horrible time to be alive even in the tropics: cold, dry, dusty and far less plant life than today.
As Svante Arrhenius, the Swede who first measured the greenhouse effect, said: “By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates.” Enjoy the lush greenery of the current world and enjoy the fact that green vegetation is changing faster than global average temperatures.","2019-07-08 08:57:53","1","Maxi720736","1747911891.5542014","CO2 is good","manual"

&#x200B;

Alright, why not. Forgive me for not putting many sources to these statements, I'm going to try doing that in an edit to this post. 

1. **Does climate change exist/is it an important issue to discuss?** It certainly does, and it is a very important issue to discuss. It deals directly with our changing landscapes, ecosystems, seas, freshwater sources, food production, and global stability. Without a stable climate - which we don't really have right now, with temperatures already around [1 Degree Celsius](https://climatetldr.info/) higher than pre-industrial temperatures, rising around .2 Degrees Celsius every decade with no end in sight - all of the things we depend on become more chaotic, and less reliable for us to continue living comfortably with. 
2. **Has there been enough action taken on climate change?** Absolutely not.  Global Co2 levels are still increasing, along with many other greenhouse gases, and policies from governments around the world still haven't caused aggressive actions to... well, stop levels from increasing. Even now, where the 'safe' level of total global warming is 2 Degrees Celsius, we're headed for 3 to 4 Degrees with what countries *say* they'll do to keep in range with the Paris Agreement, which they might not stand by. Check out the [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/climate-crisis-demands-more-government-action-as-emissions-rise/) for more info on this. 
3. **Will the U.S. suffer economically or in any other way if more funding is put towards climate change?** We may, but our climate has already changed so much - and is continuing to change so drastically - that doing nothing to mitigate climate change will  cost us far more than doing literally anything to lessen its damage. It's a matter of having your kitchen set on fire but you made sure to purchase a smoke alarm and a fire extinguisher in case of emergency, versus not purchasing anything to put out that fire: debilitating, but survivable damage, versus your entire house  catching on fire, potentially killing everyone inside it. The US  Government put a report out during Black Friday last year on regional effects from climate change by 2100,  and - despite a bit of hyperbole from the reporters who did the summary - [Grist does a great job describing what's in store for each US region.](https://grist.org/article/we-broke-down-what-climate-change-will-do-region-by-region/) 
4. **Is economic success something you would give up for a better overall climate?** Economic 'success' is a loaded term, and it has different meanings for different people. For some, it's just ""Hey, the country's making money, great,"" where it's ""The PEOPLE in the country are making money, great"" for others, or even ""The *corporations* in the country are making money"". I don't know what camp I'm in, but - as an economically struggling college student - I'd still prefer a country with a slower or less kind economy than an environment at large that doesn't let that country exist in the first place.","2019-07-03 01:53:59","3","RatherConfuzzled","1747911931.271695","CO2 is good","manual"

Wind and utility scale solar can replace significant part of the US generating capacity for similar or lower costs. 

Coal companies may not be happy, but energy consumers may be. 

>Is economic success something you would give up for a better overall climate?

At 4C above preindustrial there is unlikely to be too much economic success. 

And yet we can still potentially avoid 2C warming by using energy sources that are nearly as cheap as the current ones and likely to continue to improve in costs.

More melt less snow to melt fresh water for people especially India and bangeledish and countries like that. It's like a cup of water that is frozen.

To understand the hype about CO2, you have to understand Radiative Forcing (RF).

>""Positive radiative forcing results in an increase in Earth’s energy budget and ultimately leads to warming. Because GHGs absorb infrared radiation and re-emit it back to the Earth’s surface, thus increasing the Earth’s energy balance, they have positive RF values. ...  
>  
>""The radiative forcing of a GHG is determined by its atmospheric concentration, warming capacity, residence time, and spatial distribution"" --[https://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RF.html](https://www.co2offsetresearch.org/aviation/RF.html)

&#x200B;

CO2 is the GHG of most concern because its Radiative Forcing (RF) is highest, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

>""Carbon dioxide is the largest single contributor to radiative forcing over 1750–2011 and its trend since  
>  
>1970."" -- page 44, IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report (SYR) [https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR\_AR5\_FINAL\_full.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf)

&#x200B;

RF of a gas is partially determined by its global warming potential (GWP).

>""The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period."" --  [https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials)

&#x200B;

So even though other GHGs have higher GWP, CO2 ultimately had the highest RF and most significant effect on global warming probably because of it being by far the most significant source of GHGs emitted from human activities and its potential to stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years, more than most other GHGs:  [https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases)

&#x200B;

Now that you know what causes global warming, we can talk about its effects on climate and the planet. The planet has already warmed \~1°C above pre-industrial levels as a result of human activities, according to the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) published October 2018:  [https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/SR15\_SPM\_version\_stand\_alone\_LR.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/SR15_SPM_version_stand_alone_LR.pdf)

&#x200B;

This is when we use the term ""climate change."" The increased temperature melts glaciers and sea ice, increasing sea levels. I highly recommend watching this brief video about misconceptions about climate change, even if you are not a denier: [https://youtu.be/OWXoRSIxyIU](https://youtu.be/OWXoRSIxyIU)

&#x200B;

With all the negative effects of warming on the planet, 175 parties (174 countries and the European Union) signed the  Paris Agreement in 2016 ([https://unfccc.int/news/175-states-sign-paris-agreement](https://unfccc.int/news/175-states-sign-paris-agreement)) to limit warming to 2°C and further to 1.5°C ([https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris\_nov\_2015/application/pdf/paris\_agreement\_english\_.pdf](https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/paris_agreement_english_.pdf)).

&#x200B;

Yet, the IPCC SR15 showed that 1.5°C was an even better goal than 2°C. Here is a NYTimes article summarizing the report, with more ice-free summers, extreme heat, water scarcity, loss of species range, loss of coral reefs, sea level rise, crop failures at 2°C vs 1.5°C:  [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html)

&#x200B;

The IPCC SR15 went further to say that in order to limit warming to 1.5°C,

>""global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40–60% interquartile range), reaching net zero around 2050 (2045–2055 interquartile range).""

&#x200B;

Since the report, some governments have adopted or attempted to adopt goals consistent with SR15. Perhaps the most high-profile proposal in the US was the Green New Deal, which had goals consistent with SR15, but did not pass. [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text)

&#x200B;

Yet according to Climate Action Tracker, only 7 countries (Morocco, The Gambia, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, India, and the Philippines) are on track to hit the 2°C target, with only Morocco and The Gambia on track towards 1.5°C. The US, the second biggest GHG polluting country after China in 2014 ([https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data)) is doing even worse and projected to be 4°C+ under Trump's plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement:  [https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/)

&#x200B;

This is unfortunately the climate crisis we are in.

&#x200B;

As an individual, it seems like you can't do anything significant to help, but you can. You might think that, say, driving an electric vehicle (EV) or hybrid vehicle (HV) won't do much because my pollution from driving a gas car is so small compared to global emissions, but if everyone drove an EV or HV, we'd probably reduce vehicle emissions by at least half ([https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric\_emissions.html](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.html)).

&#x200B;

And because of social/behavioral contagion, your driving an EV or HV probably increases the chance that people around you will drive an EV or HV, maybe by sparking conversation about your car or even reducing GHG emissions. This is similar to the multi-level marketing idea that if one person sold an idea to five people and each of them sold the idea to five more people and so on, you'd reach the population of the Earth in just 13 cycles:  [https://www.cnbc.com/id/100366687](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100366687)

And still my parents got big gas guzzling vehicles because they were more comfortable in them and I think also because they thought if climate change was really a threat then we'd be doing something about it. 

And then there was a time around the late 90s where even smart conscious people thought that maybe climate change wasn't really happening or it wasn't going to be that bad. 

I moved to Chicago in the early 00s and rode my bike/public transit, didn't have a car was a vegetarian etc... But somewhere around 2014 I gave up and I started to have that thought in the back of my consciousness that - if it was really this bad we'd be doing more. It was at that same time that I was graduating with a degree in chemical engineering and started working in the medical device field. Still supporting climate change action, but just not on my mind so much...

Then I decided to actually read the IPCC's Oct 2018 report and study it... Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! 

My fucking in-laws can't even eat a meal without bitching about paper straws how the fuck are we going to convince them that they can't eat a lb of beef with every fucking meal???  How are we going to convince them that maybe they need to live a little more humbly?  Convince them to trust scientific consensus when they think the son of a god is going to return from the dead at any moment and rule over the Earth for 1,000 years?

1. You need a close relationships with friends or family. 
2. You need a sense of contributing to the community. 
3. You need a connection with nature.

Buddhist monks, who give away all their possessions, are the happiest and strongest people I've ever met.  It's not about reliance on God.

This is kind of about how you are looking at it, and how you look at it is a choice; you could also choose to say: 

I know that the human race is coming to an end; I know that I have nothing left to lose because all is lost.

If I focus on building a life filled with quality moments and put the painful ones behind me, I can still build an environmentally conscious lifestyle and find ways to enjoy myself on the way down.

The CO2 released today will continue to have a warming effect for around the next 100 years. So going carbon neutral today will not even slow down the heating effect for another hundred years. And in that time we will likely breech 5.c and kick off another bunch of feedbacks.

Going CO2 neutral is simply not enough. We have already initiated dozens of feedbacks which combined are enough to continue the heating effect on their own without human interaction. Which means not only do we have to stop emitting CO2, AND put back all the CO2 we have emitted to date back into the bottle, but we also have to go CO2 negative in direct response with mother nature's feedbacks which we have started running. And I just do not think this is remotely possible or even in the realms of our technology.

Finally, let's pretend their demands are met, we impossibly go CO2 neutral in 5 years time. What happens next? We lose global dimming which is caused by smog, soot and transport emissions etc, with this cooling blanket suddenly gone the heating effect will go into overdrive by as much as 1.5c maybe even worst case 2.c in super short time. It might actually be the nail in the coffin.

Yes, we need to stop emitting and start bottling, but we can't go cold turkey because that would doom us just as much as doing nothing. This will have to be a very long term global project for centuries to come. It will mean we have to step up and become custodians of this planet. Manage every facet of the planet, the global economy, the population, consumption, innovation etc. We will have to make grand sacrifices and do so willingly. And sorry but it's pure fantasy. :(

And this is what  ER needs to do...good luck to them convincing people to ditch their  lifestyle and ditch the only holiday many people get abroad once I  year...it's not going to happen;

Five years?  You can go vegan today.  There is not much point in throwing away food that is already in your refrigerator.  Just never by anything non-vegan again.  That makes it take at most one week.  For a nation state it would be about 1 year (growing season) for agriculture to transition.  There is no reason why this policy could not be adopted, formalized into law, and communicated to the public before this next weekend.  If the government is not in session fine.  They can get it done as soon as they are back in session.  

>... If we say that ER is successful in their demands for the UK, it's still  nowhere near enough to prevent climate change and biodiversity loss when  you have China and India causing damage to the climate. ...

Activists in the UK should fix the UK.  We have a billion people in China who can work on fixing China.

Totalitarian states will have the easiest time converting a population.  Beijing can dictate ""tofu no chicken"" and there will be no chicken.  

> Finally, ER doesn't address the fact that we've caused irreversible destruction, both to the natural world and to the climate. 

Of course they do not.  No one can change things that have already happened. The reason anyone cares about extinction is the fact that it is irreversible.

So if you're asking if governments should encourage or simply tolerate suicidal behaviours, - then the answer is, they can't. Every person gone - is 1 tax payer less. They won't cut the branch on which they themselves sit - which is, the population of their countries.

More importantly, however, is that suicide is not doing good for the future. If you want to do some good, you gotta leave a mark. Change something and/or someones for the better. You can't do that with a suicide. As for your personal carbon footprint, - removing it from the pictuire could possibly matter a tiny bit about ~50 years ago or earlier, but nowadays we're already locked in for HotHouse Earth anyhow. At best, your suicide would delay things to come by something like few minutes. Not prevent anything. This is how much i can tell from all the science i learned through the years. 

That said, for sure, i agree that one's life is one's own. If someone seriously, calmly and continuosly feel he must perform suicide - i believe no force on Earth will be able to stop them. One does not need no ""encouragement"" nor ""permission by law"" to do it, anyway. 

Even if it'd be a crime, - noone's able to ""punish"" it for the obvious reason: the criminal is dead, i.e. does not physically exist as a person anymore. However, always remember: anyhow assisting any other person to do suicide - is often seen as a crime and in many jurisdictions is indeed punishable by law, as in this case the criminal is still alive - and can well be punished for doing things which helped to ""remove a tax payer"" from the population over which a government exist.

The latter is why you should never, in particular, use the word ""encourage"" if you speak about suicides. Might get you fined or, even, jailed.

Oh no, we don't have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years. It's pointless to! See, even if emissions would be reduced 100% _today_, - by having whole mankind disappear, basically, - even then Earth climate would still switch to HotHouse state: back in the past, when Earth had 400+ ppm CO2, its climate was ~3...6C hotter. And this comes from peer-reviewed science, mind you. Quote:

> ""During mid-Miocene climatic optimum  [16-14 million years ago] CO2 levels were similar to today, but temperatures were ~3–6C warmer and sea levels 25 to 40 metres higher than at present... When CO2 levels were last similar to modern values (greater than 350 ppmv to 400 pmv), there was little glacial ice on land, or sea ice in the Arctic, and a marine-based ice mass on Antarctica was not viable... Lower levels were necessary for the growth of large ice mass on West Antarctica (~250 to 300 ppmv) and Greenland (~220 to 260 ppmv)"" (Tripati, Roberts et al., 2009)

And that happened without all the current level of other-than-CO2 greenhouse gases in the athmosphere, namely methane (which ~trippled since the start of industrial revolution), N2O, some CFCs, etc.

Currently it's in large part all the pollution, - and in large part soot and other particles from high-altitude jet aircraft engines, by the way, - which temporarily prevents HotHouse Earth happening, by reflecting over 10% of sunlight and thus preventing that much extra heat from reaching Earth surface. Hurts agriculture, by the way: the less sunlight is at the surface, the slower plants can grow. They need it for photo-synthesis.

Well what you think would happen if mankind would, say, ""reduce emissions 50%""? Big surprise: particulates would also be reduced nearly 50%. Whoops. Big extra warming. And quick, too: unlike CO2, most of which remains in the air for 100+ years, - particulates, being heavier than air, settle down in a mater of days...months (depends on size and kind of a particulate). 

Another thing which so far delays the inevitable - is biosphere compensation. See James Lovelock's Gaia theory for details. Basically, plankton in the oceans and plants on land both resist change in temperatures in many ways, changing themselves in ways which result in temperature reductions. Such as plankton releasing more cloud-forming chemicals (this is well documented by now - [click here](https://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/0702_planktoncloud.html) to see NASA's publication about it, for example), darker-color plants on land dying to overheating due to rising temps - thus giving place to brighter-colored plants which reflect more of sunlight, etc. It's an evolutionary adaptation mechanisms at work: biosphere, as a whole, functions best when temperatures are stable, obviously, - and so it evolved mechanisms to help it happen. 

Problem is, Earth already lost nearly half of both plankton and trees, which loss was caused directly and indirectly by human hand. Some facts about it regarding forests - can be found [here](https://www.livescience.com/27692-deforestation.html); about plankton - [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/phytoplankton-population/). Rates of deforestation, forest fires, and growth of ocean ""dead zones"" without any oxygen to talk about - are increasing. The Nature itself tries to protect mankind from deadly warming - but mankind, as a whole, keeps killing her. Won't end well.

Further, warming caused by CO2 does not happen instantly. Instead, it takes some 20...50 years (estimates vary) for elevated level of CO2 to result in anything close to new thermal equilibrium state of the athmosphere and Earth surface. Things need time to warm up - it's like a kettle put on fire, which won't have boiling water in an instant, needing some time to get to the new state of ""water is boiling now"" with one and same amount of fire under it. Bigger things need larger time to warm up - and Earth is one very big thing, especially thermal capacity of her oceans, thus 20...50 years time lag. 

Well, if you'd check CO2 emissions last 20...50 years, you'd see what i mean - reductions of CO2 emissions of the ""50% by 2030"" kind - are pretty useless even if everything else mentioned above would not be present. Because CO2 emissions nearly doubled since 1980 ([source](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34872)), and yet it's ~1980 CO2 emissions which caused what we see today - with most of the 1980s....2019 CO2 emissions not yet having their full effect of temperatures. 50% reduction would merely mean going back to CO2 emission level of 1980 - which is the level which already causes runaway change anyway.

So, there is no way out. Too late. Emission reduction plan - is one big fake, created and promoted to mislead people into thinking something is being done, something meaningful and helpful. Many of people who created it - were misled themselves to false hopes, too. It is merely a pacifier of sorts. Much like you give a pacifier to a baby so it wouldn't be crying aloud. 

Should it be no fake, then we'd see huge war-like effort being done to close coal power plants, urgent replacement of cars and other vehicles by ones with times less fuel consumption (which is existing technology, mind you - [details here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_1-litre_car)), massive campaign about optimising thermal efficiency of buildings everywhere around the world, etc. Because that's how much it takes for any hope of 50% reduction of CO2 emissions to actually happen by 2030. Yet none of such efforts happens. Exactly because whole plan about CO2 emission reductions - is one big fake, and because it's indeed pointless to do such a CO2 emission reduction - won't help any much.
