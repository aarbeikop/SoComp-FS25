> Climate hasn't warmed in 20 years

Nope. There's a great website called www.woodfortrees.org which provides a database of published temperature data which you can then plot graphically. [Data and linear trend for last 20 years](http://www.woodfortrees.org/graph/gistemp/from:1996/plot/gistemp/from:1996/trend).

> A hotter world is a wetter world

True - warmer air holds more moisture.

> leading to more humidity everywhere, and more plant growth, more arable lands

Seems dubious. The atmosphere holds more moisture; so there'll be more droughts (as the atmosphere sucks up moisture from some areas) as well as more floods (as the moisture comes down as precipitation elsewhere). As the temperature rises, I would expect arable land to *shift* northward - it'll get dryer and hotter in southern areas. Unfortunately you can't just instantly set up a new farm!

> ""We are in an ice age now""

Kind of true? We're in an interglacial period, within what's called a Great Ice Age (we still have glacial ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica).

> CO2 could hit a maximum of 1,500 atmospheric ppm without negative effects on humans

At 400 ppm we're already seeing killer heat waves, like the [2003 heat wave in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave) that caused 70,000 premature deaths. Maybe he means no *direct* negative effects on humans, but what everyone's worried about is temperature effects.

> Plants can thrive with up to 50% more CO2 than they normally glean from the atmosphere; he keeps bringing up greenhouse operators increasing the temperatures and the plants growing at accelerated rates compared to just growing outside.

Probably true, but outweighed by the effects of hotter and dryer weather.

> I want to believe this guy because he puts forth such a peachy view of things, but geopolitically, the climate situation is made to sound really dire to the average lay person.

It's pretty dire. The short version: CO2 traps heat; we're steadily raising CO2 to higher and higher levels; we can expect warming to continue getting worse and worse even at the current level of CO2, let alone higher levels. (CO2 hasn't been this high for 15 million years, which is far longer than humans have existed! We're in uncharted territory here.)

Unfortunately it's a collective action problem, which means that even though the problem is blatantly obvious, nobody is motivated to do much about it, because cooperation is surprisingly difficult. Joseph Heath: [Hobbes's Difficult Idea](http://induecourse.ca/hobbess-difficult-idea/).

Basically, dealing with the problem is costly, because fossil fuels are *awesome* (ignoring their heat-trapping side-effects). So it's natural for individuals to ""free-ride"" by leaving it to everyone *else* to cut *their* use of fossil fuels.

The solution is to get incentives right, through a carbon price. Then individuals have a direct incentive to reduce their use of fossil fuels: it saves them money. Hence the carbon tax. I assume you're talking about Alberta?","2017-06-01 06:15:59","8","russilwvong","1747886769.8338537","CO2 is good","manual"
"dib41c6","t3_6ekko6","6ekko6","climate","scientific","The guy is intentionally misleading.  It's hardly worth the time to respond.  I can address a few of your points.

Climate hasn't warmed in 20 years.
--Wrong.  he temperature record for land and sea shows an increase, not a hiatus as deniers are fond of expounding.  The last few years have been the hottest on record.  Most of the heat has gone into the oceans.  The deleterious effects of rising ocean temperatures are clearly observed: reduction in arctic ice, coral bleaching, sea level rise.  On land there are many signs as well: receding glaciers, melting permafrost, earlier blossoming of flowers.  The warming of the planet is obvious.  It is outlandish to hold that it isn't warming.

A hotter world is a wetter world, leading to more humidity everywhere, and more plant growth, more arable lands. . .
--Partly true.  A hotter atmosphere holds more moisture, resulting in more total precipitation, but also more severe droughts (floods and droughts).  We are already beginning to see this pattern.  Populous areas of the world will become deserts leading to mass migration, as is now occurring in parts of Africa.  Projected droughts in key food producing regions (e.g. the Midwest) would result in global famine.  Food production is predicted to decline in global warming scenarios since increasing production in northern climes won't offset declines in lower latitudes.

Plants can thrive with up to 50% more CO2 . . .
--So what.  Plants can support higher levels of CO2, but they can't support higher temperatures and drought.

""We are in an ice age now."" --That's just semantics.  We are still technically in an ice age since there are still ice caps, but we are coming out of one.  The next glacial maximum due to cycles in the Earth's orbit would be 50,000 years from now.

CO2 could hit a maximum of 1,500 atmospheric ppm without negative effects on humans.
--Unlikely.  Similar rapid increase in CO2 to such levels is thought to have caused the Permian Extinction (look it up) due to positive feedbacks in the Earth's climate system leading to rapid climate change.  The problem is not that CO2 is toxic, but that it is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the lower atmosphere.  There is no scientific debate that a greenhouse effect is occurring: the predicted cooling of the upper atmosphere (as heat is concentrated in the lower atmosphere) is directly observed. 

Try to understand the real science.  I suppose it can be difficult for someone with no scientific background.  This guy isn't refuting any of the established science.  He is seeking to mislead.

So much of what he says in the video is so ridiculous that he loses all credibility.  He says early in the video: ""What would happen if eco-activists got their wish and ended all CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels: the Earth would begin to die from a lack of CO2.""  Once someone says something so ridiculous and intentionally misleading I can't take them seriously anymore.

I could go on analyzing his presentation --revealing all his lies-- but I don't have time.  And honesty, I think it is too late.  The inability of humanity to respond rationally to scientific information is going to be our demise.
