"d7lx6ik","t3_52niqi","52niqi","collapse","skeptical","What does food security mean in a neoliberal  world? In Ireland they exported tons of food during the potato famine. It went on the free market. Same as the USSR did during the Holdomor (6-10 million dead. Starved or shot) They sold the wheat harvest  to the west. British did the same thing in India - exported food grown in India and let millions starve. In China they has long pig and swap child - make food, Food security is a fantasy same as alt energy to the rescue. Are we expecting human nature to change soon and history not to repeat itself. Your governments are nothing but managers for the corporate state and do not give a shit about you. States are already cutting food stamps to the impoverished in the US, so why would you expect different behavior when the economy gets even worse. During the great depression there were soup lines, but if you look at pictures of the people standing in them they look like cancer patients. That happened in a time before corporations had near complete control of most of the world like today. How is it so many who grow up in capitalist countries fail to understand what capitalism is? In addition to that, not much will grow on the N American plains.bread basket as temperatures rise, the ogallala aquifer gets drained all the way and the Canadian glaciers finish their meltdown. I can;t count the number of privileged N American commenters who have convinced themselves it won't be as bad in merica or Canada. Go ask them folks down in Louisianan how they feel about these early consequences of AGW. That was a no name storm and none of the forecasters saw it coming because it's a brave new climate and we ain't seen nothing yet. Might as well buy a lotto ticket because your future is going to be mostly a matter of chance to the last man standing.","2016-09-14 02:40:39","19","[deleted]","1747879028.638657","CO2 is good","manual"
"d7lrleq","t3_52niqi","52niqi","collapse","skeptical","I think you may not be taking the poverty in the core countries into account. It's easy, from an international perspective, to think of us as wealthy nations. But the majority of the people in all of them are at the bottom of the societal ladder; even if they're wealthy compared to the rest of the world, their poverty still leaves them incredibly vulnerable to environmental and economic events.

For instance, a huge portion of the population of the United States would lose their jobs if they lost their cars. Should a fuel shortage or a price spike happen (either is possible, hail [Gail](https://ourfiniteworld.com/)), it will be a matter of days before you start seeing service shortages as well.

The definition of poverty in the Unites States is insecurity; food insecurity, housing insecurity, water insecurity. This is a population already laboring under the burden of overwork and poor health; throw a natural disaster or a depression at them, and what do you think they're going to do?

I don't know either. But I'm pretty sure it's going to look a lot like collapse.

For the rest of it though, spot on. I'm really liking the 'green zone' idea; have a center that will definitely be habitable, and access outlying areas on the days when the atmosphere is breathable and weather permits. I can see them developing gradually around enclaves built with atmospheric integrity in mind.

Thought-provoking post, thanks.","2016-09-14 00:20:41","12","MrVisible","1747879028.641657","CO2 is good","manual"
"d7lu30b","t3_52niqi","52niqi","collapse","skeptical","> The big if is going to be the possibility of global catastrophic atmosphere degradation with low O2 and high CO2. In that circumstance those who survive will only do so in what we have collectively started calling the ""green zones"" at the centre of which will be the atmospherically controlled biospheres.

I'm not sure it's practical to build domes over these countries - the atmosphere is fairly much globally held in common, surely? 

If oxygen depletes in one place, why won't simple osmosis deplete it in the 'green zones'?

Building such domes would require industrial effort on a scale never seen before, and truly enormous amounts of resources and energy, just at a time the resources and energy are running out.

This sounds like just another ludicrous techno-fix to me, but maybe I'm missing something?","2016-09-14 01:22:51","7","[deleted]","1747879028.6446574","CO2 is good","manual"

China would be OK except for the fact they are ridiculously overpopulated  and have polluted so much of their environment.  Oz will suffer the problem that so many climate migrants & refugees will head their direction from Asia that they are likely to get overwhelmed.
