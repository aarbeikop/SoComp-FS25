"3vpkxm","climatechange","action-oriented","I do my part to try and minimize my carbon footprint, but I do not think it matters.","1. ""The Earth"" will be ""just fine.""  If we screw up and can't grow food, or process water for drinking, etc, the Earth /will/ continue on without us.  Life /will/ adapt.  We, humans, are insignificant.

2. We are going to run out of cheap oil.  Easy to get to oil.  Easy to process oil.  We can only change the climate so much from oil if there is only so much oil, and we are going to, effectively, run out.  Additionally, the market already supports fracking and tar sands, both of which are expensive and inefficient.  Now we're trying to buy oil from Iran while the price of oil is low.  This is as good a deal as we are likely to ever get.

3. Many of our power plants use [prodigious amounts of non-renewable energy](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/index.html) (2014, 3_1).  Those that do use renewable energy, like hydroelectric dams, do untold amounts of damage to the environment.  We stopped producing nuclear reactors in the 80's due to well intended, but erroneously founded fears.

4. The US currently has only ~[300](http://www.bna.com/us-desalination-industry-n17179876105/) desalinization plants online.  States have already started arguing over water rights.

5. Ocean acidity?  Over fishing?  If you think the animals going extinct due to poaching is bad, the 2006 numbers for over fishing called the ball at, ""all salt-water fish to be extinct by 2048."" ([NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/science/03fish.html), [Paywall Journal](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5800/787.short))  Given that technology and progress improve exponentially, I reasonably surmise 2048 is optimistic, but I don't have access to the actual paper.  Be the actual date in 2050, 2025, or 2100, it falls under the same category as oil.  ""Enough to hurt.""

6. We shifted from an industrial and production based economy towards a consumer based economy after WWII ([Quora Discussion](https://www.quora.com/When-and-how-did-the-US-make-the-shift-to-consumer-spending-as-a-leading-economic-indicator-replacing-manufacturing-production-and-exports)).  Our personal wealth is now tied directly to our dispensable income.  Contemplate the impact of rising oil prices while you compare this winter's $2/gal to last summer's $5/gal.  To be fair, this issue is the most complex and includes everything from the baby boomers' effects on the job and housing markets, erasure of the middle class, general lack of savings and/or investments, political decisions regarding fair trade/open markets, and countless other facets.

tl:dr: We are a resilient species to the point of stupidity.  At this rate, we are going to lose a game of, ""Don't Go Extinct,"" to a cascade of our own failures.

"3xhhlp","environment","emotional","MASSIVE Gas Leak Porter Ranch, California","I've lived in Porter Ranch for 34 years, was 3 years old at the time in 1981. As a kid there was nothing but beautiful land where my siblings and friends used to ride our bikes, hike the trails, & have adventures. Almost the ENTIRE area was undeveloped until about 2000-2001 with the beginning of the Porter Ranch Town Center & other soon to come various types of buildings. Stretching after the intersection of Tampa on Rinaldi - toward the churches, medical center, and even 1/4 to 1/2 mile past Porter Ranch Town Center. The Porter Ranch Drive Exit off the 118 Ronald Reagan Freeway wasn't even built until 2002-2007ish I believe. Keep in mind that Porter Ranch is ONLY 5.59 square miles... it is an upper middle class community BUT not everyone is ""wealthy."" Many of the homes were built in the late 70's & early 80's which were inherited (over 91% are home OWNERS) or bought early at a good price. Under a mile up by the plant is a small section of multi million dollar homes, across the street a series of gated areas of homes and duplexes that were built in the 90's/2000's, on the other side of the street more and then the start of the hills where SoCal Gas begins. I read a post last night that said ""They want the leak moved to a low income area."" WOW, just WOW. It's GAS - you CAN NOT move a HUGE plume of GAS hovering in the air & blowing with the wind current - it becomes part of the atmosphere. Because we are classed as an upper middle class community people may think we are entitled? NO! People EARNED income through HARD WORK just like everyone else! The wells (94ish) have been in operation since 1954 and NO ONE told any of the buyers about them. On top of that SoCal Gas Company *Southern California Gas Company* a subsidiary of SEMPRA ENERGY (fortune 500 company) KNEW about the problems in the wells and a LONG time ago were supposed to upgrade using cement amongst fulfilling their legal obligation on regulations. I can't say for sure but speculation is that SEMPRA has done 70% of their actions ILLEGALLY. The facility where the leak is ongoing is holding 77 Billion cubic feet of gas. To put it into perspective it would take 850,000 TANKER TRUCKS to remove. It has been estimated 100,000 pounds of METHANE per HOUR is being released into the air. The emissions of greenhouse gases are the equivalent of 200,000 cars running for a year 24/7 nonstop! The massive leak amounts to about a 25% of the state's total output of climate-changing Methane - greenhouse gases in California. The SoCal gas site here in Porter Ranch is believed to be the largest underground natural-gas storage facility in the West and can hold enough natural gas to fuel Southern California for a month! Methane is about 84x worse than co2 as a greenhouse gas I've heard. This is an environmental disaster!!! We are going to have to go through potential health issues from long-term exposure to chemicals including benzene. The foul odors that some are smelling are the least of our problems. Many people & children nearby are experiencing headaches, nausea, stomach pains, burning/dry scratchy eyes, nose bleeds, vomiting, dizziness, problems concentrating, irritability, sleep disruption, lack of energy, & fainting amongst other problems - both my senior parents have passed out a few times already. Our cats seem to be lethargic but overall okay. The impact on the daily lives of thousands of families, and the enormous greenhouse gas emissions that remain unmitigated is ridiculous! As far as relocation is concerned it is one HUGE nightmare & can take weeks to months...Governor Jerry Brown where are you? Oh wait your sister is a PAID BOARD MEMBER of the company that owns a natural gas well here!

I strongly believe especially since October 23rd (when the massive leak started - and the 34 years living 1 1/2 miles from the plant) we have had our life expectancy shortened & we will be dealing with long term life affects. We need all the help we can get. This is not a statement by me in any regards to the law, I just want to express myself & I'm sure that many of the other residents of Porter Ranch & the surrounding areas feel the same. Thank you again for taking your valuable time to read this! Please look below for important information.

I posted a photo on Twitter from Friday, December 18th, 2015 12/18/2015 that shows the huge expanse of the poisonous cloud hovering above Porter Ranch and beyond - not SMOG.
