"e522v30","t3_9bc1q4","9bc1q4","climate","scientific","> I’ll leave you with what seems to me to be a very hopeful alternative. If we could make hydrogen gas (H2) from water (bacteria do it and, on a small scale, we can too), we could take that H2 and burn it with oxygen to make energy and water, which we could remake into hydrogen gas as a never-ending, nonpolluting source of energy. No CO2 in the equation. 

This was something that people looked at quite a bit about 15 years ago.  GM even built a [hydrogen-powered truck for then-governor-of-California Arnold Schwarzenegger to drive](https://newatlas.com/go/3378/), and there were several hydrogen-fueled bus demonstration projects. They generally turned out to be quite expensive to operate, and battery-electric systems have come to dominate the zero-emissions vehicle market.","2018-08-29 20:39:41","2","silence7","1747898816.8043454","CO2 is good","manual"

"e3lw3wg","t3_94j281","94j281","environment","emotional","I work for an ecological landscaping company. We try to replace flat, sterile sod yards with usable, edible native plants (grasses flowers, shrubs, trees), that attract pollinators and help the native animals and insects. We also try to trap as much water as possible on site so that it can be used and filtered by the roots. 

Take out your expensive, ecologically useless, water- and gas-suckin',  high maintenance, ugly-ass sod and do something that is cheaper, lower maintenance, and beautiful that will feed you, and provide food and habitat for all sorts of beneficial critters. Good for you, your wallet, your gut, your environment, your soil, your eyes, your... well, lots of things.

I encourage everyone here to research [bamboo](http://www.ecology.com/2013/05/15/what-can-bamboo-do-about-co2/), [artificial trees](http://climatechange.medill.northwestern.edu/2016/11/29/artificial-trees-might-be-needed-to-offset-carbon-dioxide-emissions/), and other means of obtaining negative carbon emmisions.
