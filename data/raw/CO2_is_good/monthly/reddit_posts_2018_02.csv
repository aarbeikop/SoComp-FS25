"7vaxw9","environment","emotional","I'm sick of being pessimistic about the future - can someone please post some links that will help convince me that it's more probable we're going to overcome climate change/the other potential civilisation-killers?","The only things I can think of that are positive at the moment are:

1) We've got renewables on the go, and they will eventually replace fossil fuels, despite some people trying to prolong this transition

2) A lot of media (CDs/DVDs/Games/Books) has transitioned/is continuing to transition to digital, therefore requiring less resources & reducing pollution

3) Vegetarianism/Veganism is on the rise, which requires less resources/reduces pollution & reduces the chances of superbugs

4) Transportation is starting to, and will eventually switch to cleaner fuel sources

My worry is that all of these things are happening too late.. we're already seeing lots of deaths from air pollution (which implies far more people's health is at least detrimentally effected somewhat), and an increase in cancer rates (as well as all of the other health problems that are putting pressure on the system (diabetes & obesity etc). And, as well as climate change being a potential civilisation-killer, there's also the potential for super AI, superbugs, and nuclear war (which I think is the least likely of the lot). And, back to the effects of climate change, things like an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere causing plants to grow quicker, increasing their carbohydrate content at the expense of other nutrients - essentially reducing the nutrition of our food. Add this to soil depletion & things really don't look too good.

I just want to get back to my old optimistic self lol. In a way, I wish I hadn't done so much research into these things. Any help being able to frame the future in a more positive light would be very much appreciated.","2018-02-05 00:33:08","17","14","0.74","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/7vaxw9/im_sick_of_being_pessimistic_about_the_future_can/","True","HuntforMusic","1747893802.066066","CO2 is good","manual"

This is simply shocking. I don't have the words.""

This is fine, keep going to work, keep consuming, continue to pay your bills on time, make sure you check your stocks once a day - make sure your kids get to school on time, make sure you balance your budget correctly this month, don't spend wastefully!  Just remember, you can retire in 20 years an enjoy the rest of your life on sunny beaches sipping a martini.  There's plenty of time.  

Don't do research and talk about pessimistic things like:  Exponential climate change, CO2, methane hydrates, arctic sea ice extent, global average temperature...don't google those terms, that's not good for your productivity.  You must stay productive, stay distracted - ignore the real issues, and focus on important topics like social justice and profitability.  Stop reading negative things, you should be watching TV series on netflix and instagraming with your girlfriends - look how beautiful you are!  Maybe try your hand in some crypto trades.  Crypto's are HOT, have you heard of Bittrex?  You can turn $500 into $2000!  

Most importantly, ignore history - don't do any research into mass extinctions - that's extremely negative.  Human innovation is the answer, Elon Musk's gigafactories will save us.

"7yg1ws","collapse","skeptical","The Stop Having Children Thread.","Seriously, this is an emergency.  Stop having children.  If you and your partner are trying to make a baby cancer ape, I would encourage you to stop immediately.  There are currently 7.6 billion cancer apes on this planet.  You may think that your little baby ape isn't anyone else's business, but the truth is that your little ape is contributing to:

1.  CO2 release by existing in a 1st world country
2.  Resource depletion, your little cancer ape is going to require tons of carbon, pesticides, fertilizer, steel, etc over its lifetime - there are a finite number of resources on this planet, your little ape is not helping the situation.
3.  Species extinction - to provide food for your little cancer ape, habitat must be cleared and native species killed and displaced so it can eat steak with the rest of your family.
4.  Financial burden on society:  your little cancer ape contributes to the tax burden of the residents in your city for the services it needs to survive - it needs police, fire fighters, and schools - all of which have carbon and resource costs.
5.  The future is grim, your little baby cancer ape will not likely live to reproductive age, or if it does you'll get to watch your little cancer ape make its own little apes and then watch the whole lot of them starve to death - do you really want to watch an ape (s) starve to death in your living room?

In conclusion, cancer apes have already done enough damage to this planet - at this point there's going to be, at minimum, extreme financial hardship and resource wars in the near future.  At worst, we're heading for a full-scale collapse of every biome on the planet within the next 30 years (probably sooner).
