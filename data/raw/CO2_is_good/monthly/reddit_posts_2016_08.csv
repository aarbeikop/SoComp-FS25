"4xc7c1","climate","scientific","I'm so scared about the future of climate change","I am scared. I am not scared of terrorism, of superbugs, of war. I'm scared by climate change. It keeps me up and night and stops me from eating. It makes me contemplate whether I should even stay alive on this world or whether I should take the easy way out and let others deal with it. My family and friends brush off the climate and soaring CO2 levels as no big deal, everything will work out fine in the end. Not only does that make me feel more cut off but it makes me feel more hopeless. What good can I do when the majority of the world doesn't even see it as an issue. I am scared for my cousins small children who are just starting out in the world but are inheriting so much bad, and I'm scared for any future children I may have, whether I have any at all. 

There's no good news being reported. Climate change is happening faster than expected and every day there seems to be a new factor that's been discovered and is making it even more uncontrollable. We're losing biodiversity and water sources that people don't realise are the key to our existence. Why can't people see that we shouldn't care about the kardashians and the other super rich celebrities who do nothing to help the world. I don't see a bright future. From a selfish view I hold out a faint glimmer of hope that the science is wrong but I know in my heart it's not. And that's not great for my mental health. That's not great for the world. But I feel so utterly helpless. I want to live a full life, with a career and family and happiness. But I don't see that happening. Right now I see the world plunging into catastrophe in a decade or two and nobody seems to care, because right now everything's fine. And it scares me so much. 

I know we can't predict the future but right now it looks so bleak. How can I plan for a future and look for jobs and settle down when it could all be torn down and taken away before it's even started. How can I plan to one day have children if their lives are going to be full of sickness, unhappiness and hardship. Isn't that selfish? I need someone to not just tell me but convince me, with data and facts and evidence, that it's going to be ok. Until then I'm just going to be this scared little shell of a person. And if it's not going to be ok then why am I still here?

"4x8la2","climate","scientific","Livestock and stripping forests don't contribute to global warming","This is a contrarian view that I now hold, that I'd like an educated person to correct me on if I'm wrong. I mention it because it seems there are a lot of bad arguments which distract from the good ones about climate change.

The thinking goes like this. Carbon that exists above ground gets turned into living things, then back to air, then back to living things. There's not really going to be a big net change in above-ground carbon by planting more, or harvesting more trees, or in/decreasing livestock. Fluctuations, exist of course. And some forms of carbon (eg methane over CO2) are more potent green house gasses. But same amount of carbon will exist in a location where it affects the climate (above ground), and roughly the same green house effect over time.

In my mind, the real issue would then be dredging up sequestered carbon in the form of fossil fuels. This results in a (nigh-irreversible) increase in surface carbon, and a real net increase in green house effects. In my mind, mining is a real issue, where as trees and cattle are less so.

Am I wrong in this line of reasoning?","2016-08-11 15:35:07","0","8","0.25","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/4x8la2/livestock_and_stripping_forests_dont_contribute/","True","BayesMind","1747877673.6472907","CO2 is good","manual"
"4z1apr","collapse","skeptical","Challenge your views. How and why might we be wrong?","It's come up that we can paint a grim picture of the future of our civilization.  Naturally, we have good reasons to think the way we do and there's a lot of data and research out there supporting it.

I believe that it's our responsibility as members of this community to regularly challenge our own views and look for holes in our theories.  I practice this personally, but maybe now is a good time for us to discuss it as a community.

So, break it down:

* Is there a chance that climate change could be less awful than we think it will be?
* Will the end of real economic growth caused by Limits be catastrophic, or survivable with adjustments?
* Does the economy even need real energy and material inflows to grow exponentially?
* Can geoengineering save us?
* Can personal lifestyle changes prevent catastrophe?

Don't use this as an opportunity to shit on optimists and belittle hopium.  I'd encourage all of you to seriously look at your views and why you hold them.  I'd encourage you also to look at the other side of the spectrum and make your arguments well sourced.

"4z9osf","collapse","skeptical","An explanation of entropy","Someone asked me to explain a comment I made a long time ago about the order of civilization causing the disorder we see in the world. Since it turned into a short essay I thought I'd post it here for people interested in this perspective on collapse issues.

-------------------------

I use “entropy” in a few ways. One way refers to the statistical mechanics definition. Imagine a gas at a given temperature, pressure, and volume. There are many different configurations of atoms in the gas that can give rise to those particular measurements. That is, the gas molecules are always moving around, but in doing so can maintain the same macroscopic measurements (mostly since these measurements won't be perfectly constant). Entropy is defined here as the number of possible configurations a system can have, and still have the same properties. The reason this is done is because that's a measure of uncertainty, or randomness in the system. Since so many configurations of gas atoms can give rise to a given temperature, pressure, and volume, there's a lot of uncertainty as to what the exact configuration of atoms is. We say that a gas has high entropy because of the number of possible states. (Not that we're ever actually interested in knowing such exact configurations, which is good because we can't know them.)

Compare this to all the atoms in a human body. If you arrange these atoms randomly in space, chances are you're not going to end up with a living person. The fact you're seeing a human being greatly limits the number of configurations the atoms could be in. The complex order in a human being is a decrease in entropy because there's less uncertainty as to the configuration of the matter. Until you die, of course, and then your atoms get recycled back into the planet, thus increasing the entropy. But the entropy of what? I usually think of the whole Earth system in this context to keep it similar to the gas example. You can measure some state of the Earth, like the global temperature. How many configurations of atoms can create such a state? When there are complex organisms on the planet the number of possible states the atoms could be in is reduced because only certain matter configurations are possible for life. Life means there is less entropy, or disorder/uncertainty, in the world.

This might seem uselessly abstract, but the point is too see that energy is required to create order. If you don't eat your body becomes room temperature and you dissipate. If civilization stopped consuming energy it would unravel. Trucks couldn't take goods to stores. Enough water couldn't be pumped. The list of what would stop would fill encyclopedias. You could probably list a million processes without being too pedantic about your categories. The problem is that there's no free lunch. To create order, an equivalent amount disorder must be created. 

A little disorder is created by civilization in the form of waste heat in burning fossil fuels, but this is negligible. Basically we burn fuels and this causes atoms in the atmosphere to jiggle around more in a way that's of no use to us. That's not what's destroying our climate and biosphere. The “no free lunch” is the fact that the energy we've burned in the last few centuries took the sun something like 300 millions years to create. That is, fossil fuels were a state of lower entropy that took 300 millions years worth of sun-driven processes to create, and we reduced that state of lower entropy to high entropy essentially overnight in geological terms. The global disorder we're experiencing, however, comes from pollution and the consequences of the order we've created.

Carbon dioxide is pollution because Earth's natural processes can't absorb it. The CO2 that's not absorbed is waste product in the atmosphere. Waste is a relative idea though. We need greenhouse gases to have a warm Earth, but civilization requires a range of temperature for a global society. Push the temperature too far out of range and coasts flood, water-providing glaciers melt, web-bulb temperatures make places uninhabitable, and so on. Carbon dioxide from fossil fuels is an increase in entropy itself since the gas is dispersed through the atmosphere instead of being confined to a liquid in specific regions, but this entropy is irrelevant. However, the consequences of this CO2 can reduce the complexity of civilization, undoing the order the fossil fuel was used to create. This isn't really smart when you think about it. 

Similarly, there could be biodiversity loss if there's a lot of desertification, for example. It took the sun billions of years to converge to the DNA pools that sustain ecosystems. DNA is information and I see ecosystems as a kind of resource and information processor – a highly complex, ordered machine. Desertification destroys this information and machinery, dispersing the atoms to the wind and increasing global entropy. 

There are some studies beginning to suggest that increases in CO2 create cognitive impairment. If this turns out to be true, then our species will move to a higher entropy state. Our brains won't work as well, so we won't have as much information to use (and we won't use it as well). Better functioning brains have more order to them. This might seem like a weird example, but it's just to illustrate that the concept of entropy is literally everywhere. 

There are many other examples of pollution other than CO2, and this is the metabolic waste of civilization. This waste increases global entropy by making animals sick and destroying ecosystems. The scale of civilization is too much for our planet to handle right now. We're causing a sixth mass extinction with no conceivable end in sight, we've overpopulated ourselves, and our waste products are unraveling the order of our planet.
