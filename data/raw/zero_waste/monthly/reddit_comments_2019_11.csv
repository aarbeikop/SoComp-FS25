"f76qh4b","t3_dudspm","dudspm","collapse","skeptical","""Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal means, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people. Suppose for example that some “green” party should win control of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigrous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average man the results would appear disastrous: There would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the “green” party would be voted out o,f offfice and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. For this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above.""

Edit - I do take issue with the following statement though

""Substituting Grass for Food Might “Work,” but It Would Require Whole New Systems 

If we consider other species, we find that animals with four stomachs can, in fact, live quite well on a diet of grass. These animals often have teeth that grow continuously because the silica in grass tends to wear down their teeth. If we could just get around these little details, we might be able to make the change.""

I didn't know that cows, cats, dogs, deer to name a few continually regrow teeth. News to me.

Edit - fuck you and your shitty links.  Animals that eat grass regrow teeth.  What the fuck are you smoking?!?","2019-11-11 04:41:42","2","[deleted]","1747895090.608407","zero waste","manual"

"f8svfor","t3_e20krl","e20krl","collapse","skeptical","Just going to debunk a few of these points.

>Global warming is only 1/1,000ᵗʰ of the total solar energy hitting earth.  
Total world energy use is only 1/10ᵗʰ of the extra energy earth gets from global warming.  
Global electricity use is 23% of Total World Energy use.  
So 100% solar and wind powered electricity will only affect like 3% of global warming.

Global warming, as you said, is caused by GHGs. The amount of energy we use has no effect on global warming, other than the GHGs that are emitted as a result. As you also said, global warming is 0.1% of total solar power hitting earth; that's because the amount of power hitting the Earth at any given time is astronomical, the solar power hitting earth in a few hours would be enough to power global energy use for a year.

>We have forgotten how to fix and do things right.  
We can't even rebuild the moon rockets the way they were made with slide rulers.  
The skill sets we need to survive are not finding tax havens for governments, NGOs and corporations.

This couldn't be less correct. There are more scientists and engineers working today than at any other time in human history, and they have far better tools than at any other time.","2019-11-26 17:40:03","1","Enkidu420","1747895147.0453498","zero waste","manual"

>The recent mega blackout in the UK was triggered by their offshore wind farm.

Bullshit. It was triggered by the lack of provisions for such an event.

>Nordic Europe is the most corrupt country on earth

Neither are people and authorities in northern Europe particularly corrupt, nor is ""Nordic Europe"" even a country. 

I could go on, but I somehow lack the trust that it'd be worth it.
