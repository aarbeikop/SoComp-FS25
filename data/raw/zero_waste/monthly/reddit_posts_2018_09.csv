**Futura DDB** and **Ecologist without borders** together with volunteers created actual font from a waste they have collected on a respectable event held this Saturday, 15th of September. The cleanest font in the world can now be used as a reminder that every piece of trash can be RECYCLED AND REUSED – even as art. It is also vectorized so anyone can leave or type a message in a font made from real garbage.

**The font**: includes all the letters of the Slovenian alphabet and was made by numerous volunteers from around the country when they finished with cleaning. It was made out of different sort of waste found in nature – from old cans, batteries, bottles, tires, helmets, jackets, furniture, etc.

**The result**: the cleanest font in the world will be published online and free to use for any NGO or individual who would like to raise awareness on any kind of problematic environmental topic. Either in full colours as it was made and photographed from garbage or in black and white vectorized form where user can simply install it on computer or preferred electronic device and start typing an ecological initiative or message.

World cleanup day connected everyone in the world in attempt to clean nature from trash left behind by the irresponsible ones. Slovenia wanted to go a step further and leave a special message to its residents and the whole world that would remind people that garbage doesn’t belong in the greens of a nature.

“*We want to encourage people to learn and understand the importance of the right behavior towards nature and proper waste management. That´s why we were extremely happy that we were able to create something memorable from trash together with hundreds of volunteers collecting it. Now we can finally write and send a clean message to the world as there are more appropriate places for trash than nature”* stated Urša Zgojznik, The Ecologist without borders president.

When scientists say we have 40 years, they include a carbon capture technology that doesn't exist, yet will consume cropland, forests and water. Burning up plant waste and turning forests into tree farms is anti-biodiverse. 

Europe gets 50% of its renewable electricity by burning wood and not counting the emissions. It takes 50 years for a tree to grow back, and we only got 20 years to get emissions to zero.

It will take 20 years for 100% renewable electricity, but electricity production is only 20% of the world's total energy use.","2018-09-28 11:01:03","0","1","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/9jlzm3/the_paris_agreement_will_cause_runaway_hothouse/","True","unsynched","1747883432.283514","zero waste","manual"

&#x200B;

About a week and a half ago I started working at the Palestine Museum of Natural History and the Institute of Biodiversity and sustainability. I know, two things right? Firstly, that's one hell of a mouth full. And secondly, Palestine's got a natural history museum?!?!

**IMAGES:** [**https://imgur.com/a/BJFHBl6**](https://imgur.com/a/BJFHBl6)

Yes - to both. The museum's pretty small, with between 5 and 10 volunteers and staff at any given time. It's been running for about 4 years and is the brain child of the Director Dr Mazin Qumsiyeh and his wife Jessie. They started the project with a lump sum of their own money and now have the support of the Museum of Bethlehem.

&#x200B;

The idea behind the museum is to create a better understanding of the natural environment in order to reduce conflict between Palestine and Israel. The whole complex run off 100% solar energy, maintains and grows food and fish with Aquaponics systems, builds using recycled materials (such as plastic bottles and other building materials that have been thrown away) and runs at virtually zero waste capacity.

&#x200B;

It's a story of how one academic from Bethlehem decided to set a model for peaceful and sustainable living in the face of occupation by founding a museum. With the help of hundreds of international volunteers, bringing skills from aquaponics expertise to fine art, civil engineering, and even a computer programmer from MIT, Mazin and his wife Jessie are creating an oasis of sustainable technologies, ecological and cultural conservation initiatives, and a place of learning for the people of Palestine. A twenty-first century Garden of Eden, if you will.

&#x200B;

the Museum functions largely as a research centre focussing on nature conservation, biodiversity, natural and cultural history, human environmental health and organic agriculture. Given the precarious political context the museum exists within, it quite rightly boasts it's native botanical garden, permaculture, beekeeping, greenhouse, aquaponics and hydroponics, ecological pond, and animal rehabilitation efforts.

&#x200B;

The idea of a museum to research and document the flora and fauna of Palestine came from the Director's uncle, Dr Sana Atallah, the countries first zoologists who did research on the mammals of the eastern mediterranean.

&#x200B;

One of the largest obstacles we face is that people either don’t know the museum exists, or they're concerned about the security of visiting Palestine when in neighbouring Israel. I’ve been tasked with trying to grow the museum's online presence in order to get word out and hopefully show it to potential visitors and volunteers from around the world.
