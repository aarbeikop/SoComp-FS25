The mineral mix in your phones won't last forever, for example the screen you see now, will soon be zapped straight into your brain. But that future will be for fewer and fewer people going forward, because we are cresting the top of peak communications. We cresting the hi tech ridge of Seneca's Cliff, when minerals can't be sourced and supplied, and costs spiral out of control due to myriad realities.

Rare earths are by-products of mining and crushing tons of rock for very very little return. It's like gold panning on a world scale. It's non sustainable. But when? People know a new phone every year can't last. When I was young I was told cigarettes are bad, do you think I gave a fuck? The young don't care if 5G will kill you, just like cigarettes. The few who can hear me now know it doesn't matter. I would like to thank the guy who wrote about Seneca's Cliff and warned of mineral shortages back in 2012. I would like to thank today's Natural Gas Low Inventory poster for tying this together.

Phones, TVs, solar panels, and electric car batteries are all made of rare earths and unusual elements. As our modern world creates more and more of these technologies, will things go from ""rare"" to ""nonexistent"" and what will we do then? This video does a pretty excellent run down on reality.

**What Most Yuppies Do Not Know About Green Energy**

Green energy is not green at all. It takes one ton of coal to make 6 solar panels. Wind turbines are made of glue, fiberglass, cement and steel. They use 100X the resources for 1/10th the energy. They become toxic waste sooner than you think, and they cause energy poverty and hardship for the poor, especially those poor white buggers in northern Europe. Green energy cannot decouple economic growth from emissions, that notion is the elitist pap of ivy league schools.

Electricity is nearly 25% of the world's total energy use. Wind energy provides 3.5% of total energy. Wind power produces 90% of its maximum power 25% of the time. Offshore turbines can produce 90% of their maximum power 40% of the time, but they cost twice as much and last only half as long. Wind turbine can stop producing power within minutes, which stresses the power grid greatly. Over stressed power grids lead to black outs. While both wind and solar can produce nearly all of Nordic Europe's energy on some days, most days wind and solar produce little more than 10% of their max power. Ten percent of maximal power is not the stuff of industrial civilization. Industrial civilization is what you need for your precious phone to work.

**Poor People Can't Afford Green Energy**

The European Council hopes to make the entire continent carbon neutral by 2050, but green policies have created new economic problems for Europe's poorest, and for businesses. The consequences of green policies are already starting to be felt, and Europe is still a long way from its goals.

 To achieve them, governments may have to contain widening social discontent and political tensions and manage the harm that is being done to Europe's economy. Can Europe's green experiment make it a world leader in sustainability, or has a doomed policy agenda already given the world a lesson in unsustainable policy making?

Unrealistic ideas about renewable energy are at the heart of policymakers' green agenda. Despite their promises, wind and solar developers have been unable to compete with their fossil fuel counterparts. Public subsidies were needed to guarantee green investor profits. Domestic energy prices rose the most across the EU, leading to hardship and energy poverty, where a poor family or individuals cannot get their daily rations of energy that that are needed to sustain their lives.

What poor people really need is is thermal security in in wintertime and autumn.Energy poverty is already hurting poor elderly in Europe, especially during the intense cold spells we now see because of climate change. The situation has been very bad in in in Greece, where people have resorted to cutting trees for heating. This situation aggravates tree loss and air pollution.  

The target for the German government is reach zero emissions for every energy consumer by 2050.  This means that poor people have to pay a price premium for energy. Poor Europeans are nearing the energy poverty frontier. This frontier will end up in a social and economic disaster.   Bigger problems for Europe's leaders have been caused by the rising cost of electricity for industry.  Since the EU has the highest energy prices among all G20 countries, energy intensive industries were subsidized in order to allow them to compete. Despite these efforts, heavy industry has been increasingly shifting out of the EU, to countries where cheaper energy and labor is available, and where environmental standards are lower.

Up to now, their economy is still somewhat functional. But this is changing as banking and economic models fall apart in the face of higher electrical costs.  The EU is now proposing further cuts in emissions, that will hurt the poor even more. Yet, the Greens say that is not enough. The Greens want to forbid the use of diesel and gasoline vehicles 2030. They want to forbid oil and gas for home heating by 2025, and they say we want not to build any roads beyond 2025.

The vehicle industry in Germany is one of the most powerful in the world. It is the heart beat of their economy. Millions of people are dependent on German car manufacturing. All this is happening while car sales drop worldwide. Germany now seems to be on the brink of recession, with its industrial sector leading other sectors of the economy into decline. It is insane for Germany to use solar panels to build diesel cars. By 2040, there will be 2 billion cars on earth, and only 200 million will be electric, at the very best.

Greenhouse gas emissions in 14 of the 19 largest countries, have risen since 2014. Consequently, all EU countries are missing their Paris agreement targets. The generous subsidies that European governments have given to green energy generators have become politically and economically unsustainable. Rising energy prices have become a political liability.

When governments in Europe cut back on profit guarantees for wind turbine farms, private investment plummeted.

[Wind and solar are thriving in Europe — without any ... - Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/30/17408602/solar-wind-energy-renewable-subsidy-europe)

This has been embarrassment to the country which hosted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 23rd meeting in 2017. Shortly after the conference, it emerged that Germany would fail to meet its 2020 targets for emissions reduction, energy consumption and renewable energy production. These failures have signaled to the world that not even advanced and wealthy countries can meet the targets they set without causing great hardship.

Europe's ambitious green policies face many technical and political challenges. Targets have been set without any idea about how to achieve them. Despite European statements of unity and commitment, green values are not shared across Europe. In the recent EU parliamentary elections, European Green Party successes were confined to the north and the west of Europe. There is growing skepticism of green policies where incomes are generally significantly lower in the south and east. 

The hardships felt by Europe citizens as a result of rising prices and loss of competitiveness have caused a polarization of European politics with the center losing to ascendant populist right wing parties.  Meanwhile, even within the greenest of EU Member States, these green policies have triggered political crises. France has seen a year of protests, sparked by green taxes that added to the rising costs of living. People have been killed and hundreds of people have been seriously injured. Farmers angry about the increasing burden of environmental regulations, organized protests that brought the country to a standstill.

These protests are reactions to policies that have been set without any idea of how they will be achieved and take no account of the opinions of people for whom they will cause hardship. Europe's green policy experiments are far from saving the planet, and seems instead to push Europe closer towards economic and political chaos. Europeans are muddling though right now, but in the next few years, black outs will become more common, as the brittle fragility of renewable energy becomes obvious.

Meanwhile back at the ranch, China is sucking up all our jobs, and laughing at our policy foolishness. The US mass media is the laughing stock of the world, and the average Yuppie Yank doesn't have an actual clue to what's really going on. China pours more cement in 3 years than the US ever did in 300 years. Their newest airport is so fucking huge, it's unbelievable - while American airports are again the laughing stock of the world.

I don't know this stuff because I'm a fucking genius, I know it because I'm willing to read both Zero Hedge and Ecowatch. Both sides are bullshitters, each worse in their own way. Ignore either side at your peril. Sitting around thinking you're more enlightened than most people doesn't help anyone.

I spent years as a homeless person, and I spent years helping homeless people. While I was doing that, you likely spent years in school learning a bunch of bullshit that has almost no relevance to your life. Decoupling is for dogs, not world economies.

Collapse cannot be fixed because it is cumulative, unstoppable and irreversible.

**Total World Energy = 10% of Warming**

Global warming is the extra heat earth gets from the sun due to GHGs.

The chances of any particular year being one of the hottest 10 on record is about 1 in 10.

The chances of 35 years in a row being the hottest are 1 in a billion, billion, billion.

Global warming is only 1/1,000ᵗʰ of the total solar energy hitting earth.

Total world energy use is only 1/10ᵗʰ of the extra energy earth gets from global warming.

**Source:** [Thunderf00t on YT](https://youtu.be/N5UugtV06qw) \- 9:11 minutes

Global electricity use is 23% of Total World Energy use.

So 100% solar and wind powered electricity will only affect like 3% of global warming.

But only if you have 100% fully operational power working 100% of the time.

Large offshore wind turbines will cost twice as much and last half as long as expected.

100% solar wind global electricity is impossible, and even if not, it will have zero effect on runaway hothouse mass extinction, other than minor varies to speed.

Speed matters because life on earth is going extinct even without global warming.

We are poisoning everything from bug to fish to bird to frog.

CO₂ gas will cumulatively, irreversibly and unceasingly heat earth every day forward.

Indoor urban air with 1,000 ppb CO₂ makes you 15% stupider.

Fossil combustion causes magnetic nano particle build up in the brain.

Nano plastic metals are eating the blood walls to your brain from inside your head.

Green house gases must go down, or life on earth will die even faster than we poison it.

It took 100 years for total CO₂ levels to go up 30%.

But human GHG emissions went up [50% in just 30 years](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

Up from 23 to 36 billion tons per year.

Human emissions went up at least 40% since COP25 started 25 years ago.

[We failed at 4 international climate agreements in 30 years](https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/canada-emissions-record.jpg?w=768).

If 30 years of failure is not proof enough of collapse for you, then nothing will be. 

You're okay Boomer. It's all right Zoomer.

Global warming will trip 5 Major Tipping Points between 1.5° and 2 °C triggering runaway hothouse mass extinction.

Runaway hothouse mass extinction cannot be reversed or stopped, accumulates and accelerates forward through time.

Breaching multiple major systemic tipping points causes runaway conditions.

Plus we lost half the animals on earth in 40 years, and we'll lose half again in 20.

All the vertebrate and insect mass on earth are being wiped out by crop and livestock poison.

Bird fish and frogs are dying from our food, water and soil, not just weeds and bugs.

Vertebrate and insect brain and male sex organs are degraded by petrochemicals.

All sexes of vertebrates and insects are more sterile, weaker, sicker and stupider due to petrochemical degradation. 

This in not yet obvious but is cumulative, and cannot be stopped or reversed without exposure reduction.

These petrochemical nano micro particles are in 98% of us.

The metals, plastics and pharmaceuticals in our water food and clothes is lethal.

The chemicals in our SuperFund toxic waste sites will be released by climate fire and flood.

The Canadians have to freeze enough arsenic dust to kill all humanity in the melting arctic tundra forever, and always without fail.

America's aging nuclear plants threaten catastrophe. 

So why don't we just plant a lot of trees? 

To get the U.S. to carbon neutral you would have to plant 20 million trees twice per day, but only if they can grow full height in a single day

**ZERO carbon USA prescription** = 2,000,000 full grown new trees, 2 X per day before bed

Forests are dying [now](https://csfs.colostate.edu/2017/02/15/800-million-standing-dead-trees-colorado/), planting trees won't [fix ](https://mashable.com/article/california-tree-die-off-climate-change/)it.

The tropical trees we do plant are for timber, rubber and palm oil plantations, and are counted as rain forests paid by green carbon tax credits.

Up to 50% of the renewable electricity Nordic Europe gets comes from burning imported tree pellets.

This massive fraud is subsidized by carbon taxes.

Only rich people can afford the carbon taxes we all pay.

If everybody pays carbon taxes, the rich can afford them.

They call it social justice. James Hansen knows how to fix this but no one gives a fuck.

We have forgotten how to fix and do things right.

We can't even rebuild the moon rockets the way they were made with slide rulers.

The skill sets we need to survive are not finding tax havens for governments, NGOs and corporations.

Governments, NGOs and corporations have nothing to do with our survival.

They only think they do because of all that privileged schooling.

Once we get that through our head, we'll be better off.

First premise: we're going to collapse. Second premise: green energy will cause collapse.

The recent mega blackout in the UK was triggered by their offshore wind farm.

There's 2 people I hate to get lectures from, the first one is a vain smug arrogant sommabitch, Zezick, and the second one is Vaclav Smil, also a vain smug arrogant sommabitch,  but I feel more empathy to math than society.

I knew this was coming, the IEA released a report promising solar and wind will pass coal and gas by 2035 worldwide.

It took the world 30 years for solar and wind to reach some 6% of total world energy use. I believe Kevin Anderson says total emission went up 60% in those 30 years. The climate doesn't give two hoots if those emissions are man-made or Gaia-made. The idea that we are progressive is gaslighting by gas companies, I know it's always funny when irony goes full circle. Natural gas is the socialist third rail of politics.

All this Russia Syria stuff is about who is going to sell gas to Europe. Natural gas is now what oil used to be back in the 1970s, an upstart. The IEA likely forgot to mention that the US is the number one exporter of oil, gas and coal to the world. Nordic Europe is the most corrupt country on earth filled with white smug vain arrogant socialists. They burn their recycled plastic and waste paper for electricity, which  rain down as nano and micro plastics on us.

They get 60% of their electricity burning biomass, which includes agricultural waste and wood pellets. There is no such thing as agricultural waste, and wood pellets are rain forests. They built fleets of offshore wind farms of fiberglass and steel that can't take the punishment. Offshore wind farms can produce 90% of their total power 40% of the time, which is way more than on land. First, the high impact of sand, sleet, ice and micro particles cuts their lifetime in half.

The new wind turbines are so big that the wind speed, direction and strength difference between the top of the spin and the bottom are worse than expected, not properly modeled. This worse than expected is for the weather we already have, which will be nothing compared to the weather we will have in 10 and 20 years. Blades dissolving, towers twisting and third is that power inverters etc. are always failing sooner than expected. Especially in salt water storm zones.

The wind can drop to zero within 3 minutes, so you need a fleet of natural gas power plants to provide instant base power. The only thing that ever stayed the same over the last 70 years is the national electric grid. This is your grandpa's grid, and it will take trillions and decades to upgrade. The old grids weren't designed for current stresses, let alone future stresses. The grid can barely handle today's world, let alone the fantasy world of the IEA. People think Norwegians are vaunted Nordic Eco Saints, when they're actually pigs. They're building a floating tunneling highway next to brand new offshore oilfield. Vikings were slavers driven by harsh climes. The next wave of slavery will be driven by tropical climes.

Up to 30% of Australia's solar panels are defective because the world's top brand panel makers agreed to off load their defective panels to Australia. How's that touchy cutey feely stuff workin' for ya now? Everything you think is important is not because China and Asia control the world. Fossil emissions must go down 50% in 10 years, but investors plan for 10% more. In 10 years there will be a flood of drought immigrants to Canada. The 2020s is the decade of destruction for the tropics. In 10 years your thoughtful feelings won't mean shit.

When you look at a Chinese map of the world, China is in the middle of the map. China is middle earth now. They got the cojones to destroy the steppes for rare earth elements, and the quick nimble workers with the mental fortitude to do it. Their version of social media makes ours look like pussy cats. There are 4 billion flights per year on earth, those flights are the 7th largest driver of the world economy. If all goes as investors plan, there will 8 billion flights per year by 2050. China's newest airport is so big, it looks like a giant mushroom landed from space.

America's newest high speed train will maybe some day run from Las Vegas to the desert outskirts of LA. People can see the hypocrisy of Nordic Euro Green Energy. The COP climate process is 25 this year, next year it will be old enough to bear grand kids. The new deep state yuppie elite of climate conferences, were cut their teeth and were weened off them. During that time, Indonesia killed their elephants and apes for palm oil plantations so Nords could burn it in their cars, the cars they claim to build with solar and wind power, the same cars with emissions testing cheat ware on them.

It was just a couple years ago that the world energy consensus was that renewable would never amount to much in so little time. That has not changed, only the bullshit consensus has changed. We could very well end up going to war for Africa's food in the next 10 years if we keep going the way we did the last 40. I spent 10 years bitchin online, and I guarantee not 10 more.
