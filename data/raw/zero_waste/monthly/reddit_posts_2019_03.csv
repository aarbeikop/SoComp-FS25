"b2a42g","environment","emotional","Get laid off, start a company","On January 20th 2019, I was 25 and was laid off for the second time.

I had just been given 60-days notice from my job. After a major company merger, my entire division was cut after  spreadsheet level cost/benefit exercise deeming the overhead as redundant.

I had essentially 60-days on payroll to do whatever I wanted.

Travel is the obvious first inclination. And highly recommended by most friends.

Take up a new hobby.

Enjoy the time and relax.

Work out a lot.

Really anything besides start a company.

But I had a gut feeling that I stumbled upon 3 concentric circles colliding- my career, the market and social conditions were at a point where I genuinely believed putting up the upfront costs (all self-funded) for an eco-friendly cleaning alternative would (hopefully) yield a great impact and return.

Essentially, I decided to put into practice my passions that energized me far more than digital advertising. It is a scientific fact that our current plastic and chemical consumption is unsustainable for the world (re: Nat Geo, World Economic Forum, etc.). But making eco-friendly choices is currently either **A. expensive B. inconvenient C. not ""as good as the non-organic alternatives"" or D. all of the above**.

**I wanted to solve for all of the above**.

**And believe I have, with Planet Pods.**

35 days later and a few thousand dollars in the hole, Planet Pods launched.

It's now been 56 days since I came up with the concept and I've been working harder than ever to get this into consumers hands.

The product is ***amazing***. Packed with baking soda, citric acid, vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, essential oils, and a bit of Mica powder, Planet Pods are a fun/better/different way to clean without plastic or chemical waste. Additionally, consumers have the opportunity to opt into eco-refills for zero waste cleaning (aka the pinnacle of sustainable consumption!).

I would love for you all, Reddit community, to help support my brave initiative. It has been a humbling/insane experience that I am beyond thrilled to have experienced.

Any and all support for a small business means more to the small business owner than you could ever imagine. I tear up almost every time I see a new fan/supporter. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Best,
