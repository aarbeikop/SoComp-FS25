"ahf442","environment","emotional","Who was the worst candidate on the environment in 2016? The answer may surprise you.","19.5% of America's power grid comes from nuclear power plants.  While not perfect in every way, they do have the significant virtue of not producing greenhouse gasses.  Global Warming is the biggest environmental problem we are facing and has the greatest extinction level potential.  Nuclear power plants offset roughly twice as much greenhouse gasses as Solar, Wind, Hydroelectric, and all other renewable sources **combined** preventing a minimum of 2 BILLION TONS of greenhouse gas emissions per year.  The real number is much more than that because if they were closed tomorrow some of the slack would be taken up by natural gas and some by coal and exactly how bad it would be would depend on how much coal was in the mix.

Trump has been ... bad. The good news is that we are still decreasing emissions every year.  The bad news is that the rate of decrease has slowed substantially under Trump ([https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/18/environmental-protection-agency/are-greenhouse-emissions-down-under-donald-trump-e/](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/18/environmental-protection-agency/are-greenhouse-emissions-down-under-donald-trump-e/)).

But there is some really good news!  For the first time in decades a couple billion has been invested in Gen IV nuclear power plant research.  The reason the Gen I nuclear plants produce such radioactive waste was they were invented by the military during WW II for the primary purpose of creating nuclear weapons.  If you take all the energy out of the fuel then there isn't enough energy left in the nuclear waste to go BOOM in bombs.  That is no good to the military so they chose to build plants that only remove about 5% of the energy from the fuel as electricity - when you get right down to it the electricity is a happy side effect of the munitions program.  But that isn't the only way to build a nuclear power plant.  A molten salt reactor can remove 98% of the energy from the fuel, *it can even use waste from a Gen I reactor as fuel*.  Its waste is low level, slightly warm for about 300 years, not deadly hot for 150,000 years.  And they are designed to have no gas phases so they are never under pressure and can't blow up.  Nor do they melt down as their standard operating temperature is also their max temperature.  If we want to be zero carbon by 2030 THIS is how we do it.  Steady, reliable power, even when the sun is down and the wind isn't blowing without the ecological damage of mining absurd amounts of rare earths for batteries.

And one man in 2016 was absolutely dead set against it.  Bernie Sanders has voted against nuclear power research every single time he could and had as a campaign pledge the promise to shut down every nuclear power plant in the US via executive order by refusing to renew their licenses to operate.  He could have done this at the stroke of a pen - no votes needed.  In 2015 carbon emissions in Vermont rose 7% after decades of steady declines because Bernie led an effort to close the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant.  Seven Percent.  Emissions in New England as a whole rose 4% since carbon doesn't obey political boundaries.

Bernie would have done what he did to Vermont *to the entire country*.  He would have been several orders of magnitude worse for Global Warming than every bad thing Trump has done put together.  Hillary, otoh, would have been awesome.  She supported research into modern nuclear power and was going to push renewables as far as the legislature would let her (so exactly as far as Bernie would have pushed them).  Going into 2020 Dems are split into three groups.  The ones who acknowledge nuclear power has an important part to play.  The nuclear-phobes who won't push it but also won't take the hatchet to our existing plants until they have an equally green alternative.  And Bernie Sanders, who is the greatest threat to the environment in American politics.  He would single handedly set us back decades on emissions.  2 billion tons of carbon per year.  Minimum.","2019-01-18 21:15:50","2","6","0.57","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/ahf442/who_was_the_worst_candidate_on_the_environment_in/","True","Mrs_Frisby","1747886387.178284","zero waste","manual"
"aiy61m","collapse","skeptical","Don’t know how to live, conflicted between switching to a “green” lifestyle and carrying on as usual.","Hi everybody, so I’m interested in hearing how you’ve changed (or haven’t changed) your lifestyles after learning of ecological collapse.  

We know that the first world luxuries of cars, flying, meat, plastic-packaged goods etc are wreaking havoc on our biosphere, and even if individual carbon footprints are a drop in the ocean compared to what corporations emit, part of me still feels that we should at least do what we can, and do the right thing just because it’s the right thing to do, even if it doesn’t result in the desired outcome. Individuals collectively thinking that since their actions won’t make a difference, they might as well live however they want, do whatever they want, surely contributes to the problem, no? Aren’t we morally obligated to minimise the harm we do? 

HOWEVER, part of me also feels that it’s too late, that the momentum of our industrial/capitalist/consumerist society is too strong to stop and there’s nothing that can be done about it. The wheels will keep turning until we find ourselves hurtling off the cliff into the fiery pits of a collapsed hellworld. If that’s the case, then why not enjoy all the conveniences and luxuries this sinking ship has to offer while we can? Why not travel to different countries while air travel is still accessible, why not enjoy hot baths, why not eat plastic-packaged, imported chocolate? Why not live in comfort while it’s still available?

I’m finding it difficult to reconcile these two conflicting mindsets. 

After coming across this sub, my initial reaction was depression. Then I decided to turn that depression into fuel for action. I wanted to believe there was hope for the future. I decided to overhaul my entire lifestyle as much as was feasible. I went vegan. I decided to commit to minimalism, zero waste, anti-consumption, sustainability.  I decided to live car-free and not have children. But with the exception of having children, I have to admit that it’s been hard to keep my resolve for all the other things, when hope seems to become more of a foolish illusion with each day that passes. Going for drives is something that helps me cope, but it gives me cognitive dissonance because I know I’m being part of the problem in choosing to drive. I imagine it’s what a Christian must feel like when they have sex before marriage. 

In closing, I’m filled with despair and I just really don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I just want to kill myself. To get out of my own head, I thought I’d try and seek some wisdom from the good folk over here. I’m curious to hear how other collapse-aware people have decided to live their lives.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the replies everyone. I have read through them all and it seems there’s many different paths you can take when aware of collapse. I’m still lost as to how I should live my life but reading your replies was still comforting nonetheless, and gave me some perspective. I hope I’ll be able to find a path that will give me peace soon. Much love.

"acj35b","sustainability","action-oriented","Is Zero Waste in the Private Sectors Interest? - Question for the room","I'm just looking for some opinions here - I work for a renewables market-development organization, and we run a larger conference every year that tends to go beyond our usual scope\*.

Yesterday we're going through some of the topics for this years conference and one of them is Corporate Zero Waste (the exact concepts are currently being fleshed out). I made the argument that Zero Waste isn't a market development goal in terms of advancing renewable energy and they pushed back saying there's an opportunity for wealth creation there. I don't see it and I think it's a buzzword that will be dead in 10 years.

&#x200B;

**What are your thoughts on Zero Waste? Is there a private sector option for that? Or is this a government-lead venture that we'll need the private sector to be legislated into. I'm here to learn - no wrong opinions.**

&#x200B;

\*As an example, during the year we'd work with companies that would, e.g. do microgrid as a service, but we wouldn't work with engineering firms that show up for the construction/project/etc. At this conference we would consider that engineering firm a target audience.","2019-01-04 15:17:57","7","2","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/acj35b/is_zero_waste_in_the_private_sectors_interest/","True","SilverCyclist","1747886743.09712","zero waste","manual"
"ah76u1","sustainability","action-oriented","Audience gift ideas for a panel on carbon politics","Hello! I am looking for sustainable/low waste gift ideas for a sustainability panel I am helping plan in March. The panel is apart of a series run by the student association for my field of study (environment and urban sustainability). This is my 3rd year helping plan this panel series, with this years focus being on carbon politics. All attendees to the panel receive a gift bag at the event, which contains various items to help them live a more sustainable lifestyle. Last year the gifts included bamboo cutlery, cotton bags, and low waste lip balm. Ultimately the most sustainable gift would be no gift but it’s nice to give people items to help their transition to sustainability. We are looking at a budget of around $30 per gift bag. The physical bags will be branded cotton tote bags which can be used over and over again. If anyone has any items that they cannot live without or would love to receive at an event it would be great if you could share them. Some ideas for this year include metal straws, mesh produce bags, reusable sandwich bags, lip balm, and reusable cutlery.","2019-01-18 05:25:37","1","2","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/ah76u1/audience_gift_ideas_for_a_panel_on_carbon_politics/","True","jasmintasia","1747886935.395412","zero waste","manual"
