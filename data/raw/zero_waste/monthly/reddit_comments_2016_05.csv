Essentially it's our lifestyles that have caused climate change. Had we all stuck at a 1950s lifestyle, and (importantly) kept our population at 1950s levels, there wouldn't now be such a problem. So what we need to do is move backwards to that era. No more than one car per family. Few electrical appliances. Hang washing out to dry instead of using the dryer. Plant vegetables in part of the garden. 

But we can do modern things like paint the roof white and fit insulation and double-glaze our windows, keeping the house warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

Anyway, good luck with your class - the three simplest things I and everyone recommends as a starter is using a bike instead of a car for any journey of three miles or less; only buying stuff you really need; and turning off lights and appliances at the wall whenever they're not in immediate use.","2016-05-26 06:04:59","1","ririd","1747854201.794785","zero waste","manual"

More easy things: Use stuff longer (you don't need the newest, most fashionable of gadgets and clothing), repair what's broken instead of throwing it away. Take a bag or basket with you when you go shopping. Put a composter in your back yard.","2016-05-26 20:05:51","1","ebikefolder","1747854201.797428","zero waste","manual"
