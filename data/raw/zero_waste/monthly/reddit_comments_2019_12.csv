"fcj02sx","t3_ehdb1l","ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Hey there! Your post is so inspiring! I feel weird giving advice to someone who definitely is living a more conscious life than I, but a couple things I thought of are:
- air drying clothes vs in the machine
- purchasing clothes made from fabrics that do not give off microplastics in the wash
- hosting a clothing swap with your friends/family is a great way to promote circular and slow fashion! (Also look up Remake, a non profit that will give you the tools to do this and more!!)
- joining a local sustainability group like a zero waste club or one that focuses on the greener policies","2019-12-30 02:45:45","11","phomo8","1747896573.4681458","zero waste","manual"
"fciuq0i","t3_ehdb1l","ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","just an idea is to try doing some more local thrifting! reused clothing is great but depending on how much you shop online the packaging can be wasteful :)","2019-12-30 01:44:28","8","cred41","1747896573.470902","zero waste","manual"
"fcinnyx","t3_ehdb1l","ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Talk to others.  Share ideas with friends- for the good of the planet.  See if your work can make changes.  You sound like you’re doing amazing- we need more people in the world to realize the importance of it all.","2019-12-30 00:27:21","6","VoyagerOrchid","1747896573.4732769","zero waste","manual"
"fcisduh","t3_ehdb1l","ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Beyond personal change, the next step is external. On a more hands-on level, If you work in an office or large building, you can talk to management about how they can green the building, or conduct some guerilla energy efficiency tactics like turning off lights/thermostats in the evenings. But there's also higher level advocacy, like attending rallies, voting, as you said, or moving your career toward the environmental space. No matter what your skill set or background, you can choose your employer or occupation to benefit the environment.","2019-12-30 01:18:03","7","Tscook10","1747896573.476704","zero waste","manual"

Since you asked, You may wanna look into the environmental jump you get by cutting out all animal products!  There’s tons of vegan food subreddits that make it easy.

"fcj1ooj","t3_ehdb1l","ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Just read the first few pages of that book and now I'm 10 times more scared and more despondent than before... ffs we need large scale policy change, makes me so angry I live in a country that is doing very little. Our politicians have their fingers in ears singing ""la la la...""

For me this year it's less meat. My SO is not going to accept vegetarianism 🙄 so opting for less but locally sourced and or organic is i think my best bet. 

For you I'd echo do what you can to influence your work and community, and plant anything even if just to stop soil erosion and boost bee population.","2019-12-30 03:04:24","2","26KM","1747896573.488642","zero waste","manual"

Because all of this stuff is great on the personal level, but if we don't have leaders in government who will require corporations to do their fair share, it's all for naught.","2019-12-30 07:53:42","2","Dejohns2","1747896573.490206","zero waste","manual"
"fcju0ri","t3_ehdb1l","ehdb1l","sustainability","action-oriented","Individual change of the kind your displaying is huge, and often mischaracterised or underplayed. 

Unfortunately, we need a whole lot more people living like you for it to make an impact, and current indications (a rise this year of emissions by 4%) suggest not enough are, and that we are failing in other areas too. 

Think of it in terms of scale and impact: Instead of litter picking on your own, can you find time and energy to organise an event where 10 other people attend? If you can, then you just increased the scale and impact of your actions. 

Convincing family members is a good example of this too. Good luck with that. It's a good place to start for many, and if each of us made advances here, the collective impact would be sizeable.","2019-12-30 11:17:55","2","NickBloodAU","1747896573.491921","zero waste","manual"

This is a list I made on Amazon of reusable/sustainable products for the home like reusable q-tips, dryer balls, rechargeable batteries, silicone ziplocks, etc. It has a tool kit and sewing kit in there as I feel like it’s better to make an effort to repair something rather than throw it out and replace it. 

How I’ve essentially come up with ideas the past few years is every time I throw something away, I google whether there’s a washable/reusable version of it out there. I’ve also been trying to make/grow more of my own products at home to reduce packaging waste (buying a bulk bag of almonds that makes 4 months worth of almond milk is a lot less waste than buying fifteen cartons of almond milk). Washable air filters will be next on my list!

Cool showers have been shown to be good for your health even if they feel horrible. Good luck!","2019-12-30 08:02:08","1","[deleted]","1747896573.494122","zero waste","manual"
