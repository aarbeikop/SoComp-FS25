"cm78ct","collapse","skeptical","Collapse Quarterly - Throw Zero-Waste Parties To Evangelize Climate Realities In Your Neighborhood! [Idea]","I think simultaneous regional get-togethers (Collapse Quarterlies) across the country would be great opportunities to spread the word about the change that we’re seeing, which politicians are woke, and what changes we can make. 

Parties might feature games such as “pin the skull on the collapse prediction timeline” and should be held outdoors if possible to enjoy whatever good weather we may have left. They shouldn’t be depressing, but matter of fact to emphasize this is real now.","2019-08-05 06:09:50","8","8","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cm78ct/collapse_quarterly_throw_zerowaste_parties_to/","True","mylastphost","1747891748.074261","zero waste","manual"
"crbavw","collapse","skeptical","Organize society with nature as our guide","Nature follows a path of least resistance which humanity loves to ignore. Example: a person could grow plants that are native and adapted to the local area. Or a person could grow a random plant that requires more water, pesticides, a greenhouse, frequent weeding, etc. Many people don't even think twice about this, they just grow what they want and spend hours and dollars fighting off pests in a frustrating endless battle. 

Leave nature alone and you can observe this 'path of least resistance.' This should be our study guide when contemplating how to organize society.

Lets extrapolate this concept into the economy. The path of least resistance is free market capitalism. Fighting off weeds and spraying pesticides is socialism. Before you go frothing about how evil capitalism is, just give me a second. 

We all want the same things. We want the environment to be protected, we want disadvantaged people to be taken care of, we want economic security. How can we accomplish these things in a way that follows a path of least resistance and not an endless battle of fighting off weeds? 

Have you ever applied for a job on a state website? It is a miserable, outdated, horrible experience fraught with bugs, glitches, automated forms that don't work, starting over and eventually just giving up. Compare that experience to scrolling around on facebook or instagram or reddit. The difference is that these latter sites rose out of competition. There is no safety net for them. They have to work great or they loose. That is how nature works. Its why an eagle has incredible eyesight, why a cheetah can run 70mph and why we have these amazing complex brains.

Socialism tries to remove competition from the equation in a desperate attempt to take care of everybody. It is the opposite of nature. As a naturalist, I cannot believe that things can operate in a way so different from nature.

We need solutions that encourage competition and that follow the path of least resistance. Most people don't realize that our current economy isn't actually capitalism. Capitalism is supposed to mean no safety nets for big banks and total separation between the government and business. That is FAR from what we have today. We have socialism for big businesses and total government corruption via lobbying, insider trading, etc. 

I think the simplest solution is to tax everything that we want less of. We can leverage the natural incentives of cost to reduce the things we don't want. Tax carbon use, plastic, environmental destruction, pollution. If your company relies on manufacturing in another country with weak environmental laws, tax the shit out of those products. 

We need to encourage competition in every way. Maybe change patent laws so that huge monopolies can't be formed and drug companies can't charge 500 dollars for a 2 dollar pill. Destroy the two party system so we get many candidates running for office. We could use grants and scholarships to reward great ideas and inventions. 

Shrink government and allow private businesses to provide more of the services that we need. The amount of waste in state and federal organizations is outrageous. Its because they don't need to be great. They get their funding every year and don't have to worry about bankruptcy. 

The problem I have with most free market capitalists is that they seem to have zero concern for the environment and do not consider tragedy of the commons situations. If we shrink government, encourage competition, AND include strict environmental protections via taxing, I think we would be getting somewhere. 

I'm not saying I have all the answers but I believe the basic premise of this argument is solid. I would love to hear people's thoughts, especially creative ideas and not the guaranteed, tribalistic ""capitalism is the root of all evil"" response.","2019-08-16 19:34:42","0","19","0.38","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/crbavw/organize_society_with_nature_as_our_guide/","True","ogretronz","1747891880.130837","zero waste","manual"
"cxx96j","sustainability","action-oriented","Pittsburgh, PA: A Case Study Pt.5","Carolan states, “Yet it is more than just its links to pollution that makes transportation a fascinating subject for sociologist. We often think about transportation as a response to changes in society is organized. […] we drive because our urban environments require us to. Yet the data tell precisely the opposite story. Urban and community patterns have taken the shape they have because of available transportation systems. The car, for example, made certain patterns of urbanization possible- patterns that, not surprisingly are found today to be difficult to service under alternative transportation forms. Thus, although many urban environments leave us with little choice but to drive (Carolan 135).”
 
​Pittsburgh Office of Sustainability proposes these solutions to alleviate the problems that transit causes within the city. On the home front, they recommend utilizing mass transit such as buses, the T, and other forms of public transportation to get to where you need to be going. Pittsburgh has many pre-automobile communities that enable people to walk to their desired designation. The way that businesses can be involved, as we have seen their large influence in the cities development is to encourage their workers to carpool to work. The city of Pittsburgh implemented an HOV lane, or a High Occupancy Vehicle Lane, or HOV Lane, is used to reduce congestion along Interstate 279, the Parkway North, by promoting ridesharing via carpooling. This reduces the amount of cars on the road, as a result of the suburban flight. Restrictions such as two people per car, motorcyclist, and buses are the only permitted vehicles to use this lane. It advocates for lower congestion that causes pollution, and less cars on the road. Lastly, Pittsburgh implemented a “Bike Pittsburgh” program that endorses people to get on bikes and out of their cars. By establishing bicycle friendly routes all across the Pittsburgh region, bicyclists are able to commute in a safe way. The ways that businesses can promote this healthy way of transportation and life is through providing bicycle racks, showers, and lockers to facilitate in their choice of eliminating emissions through riding a bike. “Free Ride Pittsburgh”, which is a program for people who cannot afford bicycles. They provide volunteers knowledge on how to repair bicycles, so you can earn a free one through the program. There can also be incentives provided by businesses for people who use mass transit or alternative forms of transportations. Rewarding people who carpool with better parking spots, providing bus tickets, or even advocating a “Bike to Work Month”, and distributing local bike routes to get to work. All of these are propositions made by Sustainable Pittsburgh to aid in improving transit and eliminating the negative consequences of transportation. It is done through people individually and businesses collectively.
 
​Next, making buildings more efficient. In the developed world, fully 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions come from heating, cooling, and powering buildings. Many countries have embarked on major efforts to better insulate buildings and install more modern and efficient heating and ventilation equipment. Energy savings could reach 30 percent or more. LEED is the Leadership in Energy and Environment Development. It is a green certification program that recognizes best-in-class building strategies and practices. This is something you can find many Pittsburgh innovative structures taking on as a staple. As I stated above, the David Lawerence Convention center implements many strategist to reduce this carbon dioxide emissions through utilizing natural ventilation and solar energy. Another example would be the new PNC building, which is actually rather fascinating. A majority of it comes down to energy use. The PNC building uses a double-skin façade. The double-skin facade is a system of building consisting of two skins, or facades, placed in such a way that air flows in the intermediate cavity. The ventilation of the cavity can be natural, fan supported or mechanical. When this ventilation is not in use, they implement other energy efficient ways to heat and cool the office, however, this technology is aimed to use 50% less energy than a typical office building. The tower’s roof collects heat from the sun to warm the building, and facilitate natural ventilation. During the summer and spring, the solar chimney pulls air and helps cool down the building. It all aids in not needing to frivolously waste energy and to keep the building at a comfortable temperature.
 
​The building is also structured in such a way to utilize natural daylight. Pittsburgh Earth day states, “Specifically, ninety-two percent of The Tower’s office space receives direct sunlight. To ensure a healthy and productive work environment, The Tower features blinds that prevent glare, help control indoor temperature and ensure that employees have sufficient lighting at their workspace. With the assistance of automated controls, these blinds activate themselves depending on the amount of light entering the building. They automatically close when there is glare or a significant amount of sunlight and open when lighting conditions are ideal” (http://pittsburghearthday.org/pnc/). Much of the building was actually constructed with recycled parts. Approximately 93% of the construction waste went towards the building process, to be exact. Drywall was crushed to be used as lightweight board, and steel was melted and reused. The Near Zero Waste program recycles everything. This ranges from composting organic waste, such as food, to organizing bins for trash, recycling, shred, and compost. This is an aspect as to how local businesses can aid in the urban political economy for the better good: how interrelated the environment, growth of the city, and how building the city is physically formed and the sociological perspectives that it projects. PNC is a clear example of this. The sustainable objective that this infrastructure cultivates is an optimistic view sociologically for the cities inhabitants. It promotes a healthy and green outlook that is encouraged by a business.","2019-08-31 16:10:56","2","0","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cxx96j/pittsburgh_pa_a_case_study_pt5/","True","toolatetobeoriginal","1747892212.052536","zero waste","manual"
