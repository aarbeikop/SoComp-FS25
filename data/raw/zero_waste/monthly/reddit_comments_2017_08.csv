Focus on what you could do to fight climate destabilization, from where you're at, instead of holding yourself to an abstract ideal. That said, *you appear to have accepted the corporate ploy of blaming the consumer and expecting consumption choices to save the planet's habitability*. All of our consumer choices are shaped by corporate and government decisions, and our individual carbon footprints are microscopic compared to structural carbon-use policies. While you feel guilty for the electricity consumed using the internet, governments subsidize carbon fuels at $548 billion/year. I strongly recommend you refocus on participation in organized groups working to change such policies, such as 350.org. Become an activist for change and meet others who also dedicate themselves to saving the future.","2017-08-26 16:24:25","1","HumanistRuth","1747873500.791708","zero waste","manual"
