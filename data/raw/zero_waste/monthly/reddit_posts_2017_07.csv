I believe that /r/ZeroWaste is a great community for exploring deeper into ways of reducing your waste and your footprint on the world. 

The sidebar description:
> The term **Zero Waste** means that **we strive** to send zero discards to landfills or high-temperature incineration facilities. Instead, we promote the best practices of waste prevention, recycling, and composting.

>This community is for those who are interested in or currently living a zero or low-waste lifestyle. We are responsible consumers who buy in bulk, avoid disposables, carry reusable water bottles, and bring our own lunches.

It is still a smaller subreddit (but has grown significantly in the last year!) and has plenty of insightful discussions and ideas. 

You should take a look!

"6o7zx8","sustainability","action-oriented","I need ideas to motivate my dorm community, and we have $1000-2000 to spend.","It's my first time being head of Sustainability Committee for the dorm community. I have more to learn, but it's hard to come up with ideas by myself that people are willing to follow through with. Both committee members and residents don't really care much.

So far there are just ideas for awareness events/posters and a composting program going on. The committee though always has a hard time spending its money except to buy food or giveaways to encourage zero waste lifestyle. 

What are some great things we can do with this money (though I know that money doesn't change people attitudes)?

I believe that /r/ZeroWaste is a great community for exploring deeper into ways of reducing your waste and your footprint on the world. 

The sidebar description:
>Being ""zero waste"" means that we adopt steps towards **reducing** personal waste and **minimizing** environmental impact. The zero waste ideal is to send nothing to landfills or high-temperature incineration facilities and to prevent unnecessary pollution and the squandering of nonrenewable resources.

> This community is for those who are interested in living a low- or zero-waste lifestyle. There is a major focus on the ""5 R's"", being refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot. We follow this by reducing consumption, choosing reusable and sustainably-produced goods, promoting recycling and composting, and encouraging each other in our attempts to live more sustainably.
