We have been working towards red meat mineralization for awhile now, but its hard when its convenient, delicious, and has vitamins and minerals that are hard to find in other food!

I also encouraged a few fellow bloggers to do the same.  It's a small step, but still one in the right direction ","2018-04-22 22:24:19","2","Michael_Dinich","1747879613.1636841","zero waste","manual"

We don't have recycling services out here where I live, but they have recycling bins downtown, so now when the bin gets full I can put the whole thing in my car and take it downtown to be recycled properly vs just throwing it away.

I certainly share the idea of compostables but it should be equally important for people to think about what they consume.","2018-04-06 18:18:38","2","rise_homes","1747879985.5878341","zero waste","manual"
