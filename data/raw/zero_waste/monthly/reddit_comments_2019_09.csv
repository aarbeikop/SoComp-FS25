> Shifting to diets that are lower in emissions-intensive foods like beef delivers a mitigation potential of 0.7-
8.0 GtCO2-eq per year (high confidence) with most
of the higher end estimates (> 6 GtCO2-eq per year based on veganism, vegetarianism or very low ruminant meat
consumption). In addition to direct mitigation gains, decreasing meat consumption, primarily of ruminants, and reducing wastes further reduces water use, soil degradation, pressure on forests, land used for feed potentially freeing up land for mitigation.
