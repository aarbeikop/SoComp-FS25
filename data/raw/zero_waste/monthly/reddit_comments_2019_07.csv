"eve9mm9","t3_cjl539","cjl539","climate","scientific","I believe climate change studies can be inaccurate, in a way. It it is rising, but in California, they have reduced levels to 1990's levels. Way ahead of the 2030 goal. It is better to fight to keep your area safe, than we can talk about the earth. Not to mention it will probably go faster that way.","2019-07-30 04:09:15","2","BackgroundArt2","1747890800.713465","zero waste","manual"
"everoz9","t3_cjl539","cjl539","climate","scientific","One thing rarely considered(because people don’t know enough), is that climate change also has serious impacts on the rights of others, and human rights as a whole. The rights “lost” for now are nothing compared to the damage and losses that will occur if nothing is done.

"evfkjt9","t3_cjl539","cjl539","climate","scientific","Most Americans don't actually know what socialism is. They have a general idea, but most will define it as close to communism. A lot of it traces back to the Red Scare and McCarthyism where everything but the american system of government was considered a threat. A lot of people are actually for socialist policies - Medicaid, and social security for example - but aren't aware that those are socialist parties.

Mostly it stems from a combination of ignorance and fear mongering. People are often afraid of things they don't understand, and socialism is part of what they fear.

In the US, there's also a big emphasis on individual rights. The fear of taking away your rights is used heavily by one of the political parties as a rallying cry of sorts. A big part of that is the believe that they should have the freedom to behave how they wish. It's often contradictory to their other views, so I've yet to figure out the logic in that. I think a big part of it is probably the courting of the religious right by Reagan. At that point in history, I am told that religion and politics became heavily intertwined, instead of the separation of church and state that I am told was championed until then. It turns out if you appeal to people's religion, and make politics into a religion, you can do a lot. Including scaring people that their rights - often religious rights are brought into this - will be taken away.","2019-07-30 14:32:09","2","DemiKara","1747890800.718976","zero waste","manual"
"evfvw7f","t3_cjl539","cjl539","climate","scientific","Probably one of the reasons is that USSR stands for the ""Union of Soviet **Socialist** Republics"", which is a huge lie, because USSR was anything but a socialist country. Unfortunately, thanks to USSR, socialism is now associated with bad staff like totalitarian government, communism and labor camps.

If you want to know what real socialism looks like, take a look at some modern European countries like Norway or Belgium.","2019-07-30 15:54:53","2","_portman_","1747890800.7210188","zero waste","manual"
"evhyyeb","t3_cjl539","cjl539","climate","scientific","socialism -- the original meaning was government ownership and total control of the ""commanding heights"" of the economy, like the major corporations. This has been a disastrous, even deadly, failure not only in communist countries (including, say, China before it embraced the market economy) but in recent cases like Venezuela. Many in the US nevertheless say they want ""socialism,"" most recently the prominent presidential candidate B. Sanders. What they actually mean is they want a market economy with strong govt. regulation, otherwise known as ""social democracy."" But it is small wonder if some people, encouraged by the propagandists of the rich, are afraid they really do mean socialism in the original sense.","2019-07-31 00:52:57","1","sweart1","1747890800.723242","zero waste","manual"
