"daumqww","t3_5gr898","5gr898","environment","emotional","Wow, okay. Before I get into the claims, I want to point out that there are zero sources cited, which invalidates the whole article before it even begins. Even ignoring this, this guy presents false dichotomies, unfair comparisons, and deliberately deceptive scenarios.

* Plastic bags have [a carbon footprint](http://timeforchange.org/plastic-bags-and-plastic-bottles-CO2-emissions) too, of six kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of plastic. This may or may not be less than paper. Plastic bags also generate massive waste. Instead of framing the argument of ""plastic over paper,"" why not encourage reusable bags?

* Reusable mugs are used over and over, disposable cups are used once and then tossed. This doesn't factor in any of the environmental damages and emissions resulting from the [tens of billions of cups](http://www.carryyourcup.org/get-the-facts) that are thrown out each year.

* Dogs vs. SUVs, he cites an unnamed and ""pretty controversial"" study,"" hm... And what's the point? Is he trying to guilt trip people out of having pets in favor of a gas guzzler? 

* Styrofoam cups are said to be ""no worse"" than paper, oh except for the fact that they take a minimum of 500 years to decompose. Also, why advocate for pollutive styrofoam instead of reusable cups?

* Same thing for forks, I don't see why anyone would want to apologize for the plastic industry instead of just supporting reusable alternatives. That is, unless they work for that industry.

* Cars vs. BART, this one is egregious. The guy compares it to ""packed cars,"" but that's not a fair comparison considering most people drive alone. Also, public transit allows you to avoid consuming all the materials that go into a car. Finally, gasoline cars are inherently pollutive, whereas public transit at least has the potential to be renewably fueled.

* The tomato scenario seems a bit suspect. It only considers one route (CA to Eugene), and leaves out the fact that a lot of food travels far greater distances than a state or two. Also, farmers markets tend to attract more pedestrians than say a supermarket, which is where truck hauls usually end up.

* The recycling v. incinerating claim cites an outdated study in England. He even admits it doesn't apply to the U.S., or probably anywhere today. So why say it at all?

* LED lights are by far the [superior](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-light-bulb-showdown-leds-vs-cfls-vs-incandescent-bulbs-whats-the-best-deal-now-and-in-the-future/) source of lighting in terms of lifespan, energy efficiency, and cost. They're also the best option for climate change. I find it strange that he suddenly wants to talk about toxicity when he opted not to discuss the toxins involved in burning petroleum. 

* [Disposable diapers](http://www.ocdiaperservice.com/Environment.html) consume 70% more energy, generate sixty times more solid waste, consume 20 times more raw materials, use 2.3 times more water, and fill far more landfills than a reusable diaper.","2016-12-06 09:57:21","8","artannenbaum","1747866163.267307","zero waste","manual"

Even if a miracle happens and we reach zero emissions in the next decades we are still fucked. Thanks to feedbacks and climate lag, the CO2 that's currently in the atmosphere is enough to wipe out modern industrial civilisation.

So not only we'd need to reach zero emissions, but also *extreme* negative emissions in less than 20-30 years.

And even if both of those miracles happen in that timeframe, self sustaining climatic feedbacks have already been triggered. Nobody knows if those will stop if we miraculously reach pre industrial levels below 300ppm before 2050, but chances are that humans don't really have the capacity to stop those.

Those figures are a little misleading.  eg >80% of greenhouse gases in he US come from fossil fuels, for example.

Ignoring that... we need to eat, so there will always be emisisons from that, we do not need to fly, or drive or uses non renewable electricity.

"dbgeiob","t3_5j6lqv","5j6lqv","collapse","skeptical","To make it worse, specifically, on the topic of carbon sequestration, the Earth's own natural biotic systems of carbon sequestration in total enable up to 1.0 billion tons of carbon dioxide to exit the system as more stable compounds otherwise, per year. That's a lot! Wow. _Except that_ humans put in excess of 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air per year, and an additional 25 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gasses into the air as well (e.g. methane, NOx, and so forth), not to mention the effect that straight water vapour has on global warming. We are not the only source of adding carbon to the atmosphere, either. Ask volcanoes, peat bogs, arctic sea floor beds, and so forth. 

As there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere these natural systems have a _harder time sequestering carbon_, through several processes of ecosystem-level biotic degradation (e.g. ocean acidification). So, OP, you are totally right. We cannot keep adding carbon dioxide forever, and every year we create in excess of an _additional 50 year carbon backlog_ in the atmosphere. Again, each year the Earth can deal with 1 gigaton, but we make ~55 gigaton equivalents. If we do business as usual, for ten more years, we'll add **500 years worth of carbon backlog versus how much the Earth can naturally sequester on its own in the same time frame**. Every year we get more behind, and every year the systems doing the sequestering have a harder and harder time doing the sequestering. That's called The Mother Of All Feedback Loops. 

Negative emissions, as you cite, are indeed called for, but the only feasible way to do that is to eliminate carbon from the atmosphere, and, I'll say coloquially, we need to bury it again. We need a ""reverse coal mine"" basically, where we extract 'smoke' from the atmosphere, turn it in to coal putting massive amounts of energy _in_ to the system, from an unknown source, and then take the synthetic fossil fuels we made, and then bury them in open pit mines. This is essentially impossible to do for half a dozen reasons. We'd need the energy to pull carbon from the air and make a byproduct (synthetic fossil fuels or something chemically stable that 'locks' carbon in a solid form) and the bury it forever. Where is that energy supposed to come from? That energy cannot come from fossil fuels, because due to entropy at every stage, we'd need ten tons of coal to create less than a ton of air-sourced-carbon-synthetic-coal to bury to sequester it. Unwinnable. Solar panels you say? Where does the energy come from to make those? And a billion of those? And more than a billion, because not only do we need enough for our _current energy demands_ but also for _dealing with the growing yearly backlog as well_? We're already 3,000 gigatons over as it is. 

I know the 'trends' are that air travel will be 14 times more prevalent in 50 years, but that's wholesale impossible without a different energy source. Rail is more likely, if we have places and people and trains and reasons to go anywhere that far ahead of time and we haven't culturally dissolved entirely by then. (Melodrama alert, sorry)

To the best of my knowledge, we can't even actually all ""live like Ugandans"" as you allude to, to stop emissions. For one, the least developed countries have the highest population growth rates, generally speaking, and even if we all lived in abject poverty, there are still too many mouths to feed globally for us to turn off fossil-fuel-powered agriculture. The only ""solution"" that any _politician_ would ever suggest is to develop absolutely everywhere, because Monday to Friday Warriors don't have as many kids. They think if we all live like San Francisco Code Rebels that we'd reduce our growth rate to a sustainable, stable 10 billion or so. Well, if we did that, _nobody_ is ""living like a Ugandan"". Also, who would our global capitalist system exploit? Now we're back to the sociopolitical side of this all, which is often overlooked. Our socioeconomic system demands cheap labour, and even if robots replace that, we still demand cheap raw materials. And you can't develop whole nations to discourage excessive population growth if nobody has jobs and nobody has even the slightest hope of prosperity. But we don't share our prosperity very well. Not within states, and not between them either.  

It's a corner nobody knows how to get out of. We need some miracle energy source that also cleans the air, brings back species from the brink of extinction and stops them from being threatened by habitat loss and people generally, stops humans from mating, provides a fully nutritious edible paste as a byproduct, in abundance, and spouts fresh water 24/7. I'm not holding my breath. We don't have the tech - this isn't Star Trek - and more importantly, we also _don't have the economic or governance systems to enable us to change even if we had that tech_.  Everybody would need that miracle box, but our whole paradigm of profit essentially prevents us from distributing said non-existent miracle box, even if we had 7 billion patented Miracle Box^TM units sitting in warehouses right now. But we need Ugandans and Americans and Russians and Cubans to have equal access to this non-existent green energy source and infrastructure (current technology would be better than nothing) but we don't like to share. 

But we also don't have miracle tech or miracle energy. And we'd _also_ need that, along with a sociopolitical system that wasn't broken to the core that served the interests of the global 0.0001% and nobody else. The ultimate irony is that nobody, not even multi-billionaires, can live on an uninhabitable planet for very long, even if they hoard all those Miracle Boxes^TM.

P.S. As a joke I feel like making a scammy kickstarter selling a box that generates electricity, fresh water, edible paste, and then get some smarmy quasi-credible actor to ask for fundraising to ""send help to the children"". But then I'd feel bad about myself. Couldn't be worse than the Waterseer^TM or the whole Solar Roadways^TM real-jokes.
