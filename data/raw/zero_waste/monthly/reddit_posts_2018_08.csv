I believe that /r/ZeroWaste is a great community for exploring deeper into ways of reducing your waste and your footprint on the world. 

The sidebar description:
>Being ""zero waste"" means that we adopt steps towards **reducing** personal waste and **minimizing** our environmental impact.

>Our community places a major focus on the 5 R's: refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot. We practice this by reducing consumption, choosing reusable goods, recycling, composting, and helping each other improve.

The community has grown significantly in the last year and has cultivated countless insightful discussions and ideas.

"963tmw","environment","emotional","A debate brought up surrounding the slow elimination of plastic straws relating to disability","I was discussing my support of Starbucks and other large businesses move to become less wasteful through the removal of regular use of single-use, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable materials. In the case of Starbucks, this pertained specifically to the phasing out of plastic straws. 

A friend of mine was VEHEMENTLY against it, on account of it was exclusionary to members of the community who had suffered a stroke, had cerebral palsy, had Parkinson's, or any other disease or disability which left them unable to hold a cup, or use the mouth opening without a straw.

As someone who is ""typically"" abled, I must admit that this point of view hadn't crossed my mind and at first I agreed, I now think that this current movement is not actually exclusionary, and I'll explain why I think so, but am looking for additional points of view. Maybe I'm just not seeing the whole picture. 

How I see it, there are other options other than single use straws. One option is the reusable straw available in both a silicone-type variety and a stainless steel variety as a know. Personally, I can't tell you the last time I left the house without one, and they often come with a cleaner, for those especially curious about their hygiene. Some even mimic bendy straws! I acknowledge that with certain disabilities or ailments, cleaning can be next to impossible, thankful there are also paper straws, some which even come coated in a biodegradable wax to prolong the usage (won't get soggy as you nurse that iced coffee).

So I guess my question(s) is(are): is this exclusionary if there are other options? Is the issue that Starbucks is not providing all of these options to all customers? That a personal purchase will need to be made and that not all customers will want or need to make these adjustments, so it is only an inconvenience for some? Or am I just missing the point and that the real issue isn't the straws but that Starbucks didn't think of their disabled audience when making the call by offering a viable alternative to the plastic single-use straw without having to be reminded of the community by those in it?

I realize that this could potentially be a really personal subject for some, and I don't at all mean to offend anyone, it's just kind of me trying to figure out both sides of this issue since a move to zero-waste is something I am passionate about and this has be slightly conflicted.

https://news.mongabay.com/2018/07/tracking-the-shift-of-tropical-forests-from-carbon-sink-to-source/

The US burns corn in cars

Europe burns soy and palm oil in cars

50% of Europe's green electric energy comes from burning trees and plant waste. Plant waste = soil food.

Europe ships in wood from timber mafias all around the world.

We cannot cut down forests to raise trees to burn them because our economy depends on energy growth.

If we continue to grow energy demand 3% per year for 300 years, we'll need enough solar panels to cover the whole planet.

Without serious demand destruction, science will not save us because the economies of scale for green energy takes 50 years to get back to Zero, and we only got 20 years to get emissions to Zero.

It's a zero sum game.","2018-08-01 10:52:42","0","0","0.5","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/93nx5s/carbon_accounting_fraud_the_sweet_game/","True","SevereAnxiety76","1747882939.301823","zero waste","manual"
