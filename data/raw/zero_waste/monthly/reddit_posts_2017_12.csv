"7i9d1v","collapse","skeptical","Basic advice considering our future: Give up, enjoy yourself, and do not have children.","Just a suggestion.  So long as you are:

1.  single, no children no relationships
2.  Don't have anyone depending on you.

Just start doing drugs and relaxing.  Stop trying.  Putting effort into something you are not truly passionate about is meaningless.  Just give up and enjoy your life.  You cannot win.

Too many people out there try too hard.  Stop trying, now.  

If you're someone who has had children, well then you're fucked.  Sorry but you made the wrong decision, you will probably die a miserable death along with your children.  

If you are someone who is supporting a household or something, you're still fucked, but not as bad as someone who's had children.

So that's my best advice:  give up, do drugs, have sex, go out for a jog, play videogames, get a massage, go for a bycilce ride, start smoking tobacco, etc etc etc.   Ultimately, you're goal should be to put ZERO effort into unpleasant, challenging, and unrewarding activities (e.g., like getting a perfect score on your 1 year review at work, or being the BEST engineer in your firm, or getting a 100% score on your accounting exam).   None of that matters. 

Instead, your goals should be:

1) Downsize so that you can continue paying bills while maximizing your pleasurable activities.  For example:  Sell your mcMansion and get something you can afford without having to work 9-5 every day in a job you hate.  I know MANY folks out there that pay more in property taxes in 1 year than some make in a year.  STOP this nonsense at once.   Downsize to live a leisurly happy, zero effort 100% pleasurable life.  

2). Make sure your bills are paid (you do NOT want to end up homeless) and you have a large supply of entertainment/drugs/women (or men if that;s your thing) and pleasurable leisurely activities or pastimes (e.g., a stockpile of recreational tobacco/alcohol etc etc use your imagination).

edit:  In conclusion, please stop trying at once.  Find something meaningful to pursue, something of passion and love.  Do not participate in the economy aside from the basic necessities.  Create your own economy, create your own group with it's own separate economy.  Trade goods and services, heck trade bitcoin if that makes you happy.  You can trade good drugs and sex for a lot of things in this world.  Stop slaving away and wasting your precious time and energy for currencies, just for the sake of having currency.  If you need that currency to buy guitars, drugs, sex, bicycles, etc then that's great - but hopefully you can acquire these goods outside of the economy, through barter, bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, precious metals, or offer your services.   

I suppose if you truly LOVE participating in the economy, please do so - but many people have no idea that they're in a rigged game and a rigged system, and that all of their time and effort is being pissed away into a make believe economy that produces misery and suffering around the globe.","2017-12-07 20:24:17","46","60","0.66","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/7i9d1v/basic_advice_considering_our_future_give_up_enjoy/","True","harpyeaglelove","1747876847.9670038","zero waste","manual"
