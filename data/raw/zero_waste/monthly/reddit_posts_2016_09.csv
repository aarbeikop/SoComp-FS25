"54qacl","collapse","skeptical","My Collapse Collapse","Ever since 2008, I've watched Max & Stacey, read Zero Hedge and Naked Capitalism, and more recently watched more than a few Greg Hunter etc., etc. - and really, it was all a massive waste of time. I know, on some level, financial collapse is coming, but after several years of listening to their shit, I realized they don't matter. For the last several years, they have made a comfortable living off the avails of financial collapse. They are like collapse pimps, and those of us who listen to them are their collapse bitches.

I recently tried to do a daily round-up of collapse for a week, and thanks to destructo-dude, I realized I was boring. I always tell my wife she can say I'm bad in bad, but I will never accept her saying I boring, or not funny. 

The thing about collapse and habitat destruction, is that there are no solutions that are acceptable or truly viable. While the Clintonesque crowd will tell you we will all soon be dancing with unicorns and faeries next to solar panels and windmills, deep down we all know that's not true. To stop ecological collapse, we will have to kill all the billions of poor people we don't need, but progressives would rather hallucinate about a happy hobbit shire than kill billions of innocent people. What seems more probable are the unintended political and ecological consequences.

If I were to draw you a chart of rising political terrorism and declining habitat, you would see that they are converging, and will soon cross, if they haven't already done so. When political terrorism pulls past declining habitat, that's when real collapse begins. But before all that, comes financial collapse. While financial collapse will feel like the end of the world, it will be just the beginning.

The lives of people who live near the equator will be ugly, brutal and short, but in terms of our life-spans, collapse will be ugly, brutal and endless. So don't worry, the longer you are bored with collapse, Max Keiser, Greg Hunter, Guy McPherson etc, the better.

"53iop0","collapse","skeptical","Resource misallocation and its effect on the Seneca cliff","What's happening right now in my humble opinion, is that through quantitative easing and low interest rates, central banks are forcing investors to take excessive risk, in an effort to maintain economic growth. The disadvantage this has is that it creates speculative bubbles, as investors end up investing in ventures that probably won't pay off.

The investors, stimulated by the low interest on reliable investments like government bonds find themselves in a situation where they dump large amounts of money into projects that resemble a religious cult more than an actual business. This leads to the emergence of a bizarre subculture where people interpret technology as having near infinite power to create heaven on Earth.

As an example of the outgrowth of this investment environment, consider Theranos, whose CEO went from being seen as a billionaire to now having an estimated net worth of zero. She peddled technology that was already known and generally agreed upon to be incapable of achieving the goals that she hoped to achieve with it. To rake in so much money, she had to create a cult of personality around herself. 

The investors turned into something more than just people hoping to make a quick buck, they turned into acolytes of a guru, who signaled her religious devotion by always wearing a black turtleneck sweater like the guru who preceded her, Steve Jobs. Mark Zuckerberg similarly has resorted to always wearing the same identical clothing, to create this impression of being an ascetic who has renounced the world. 

They do this, because investors want to buy into a story. It appeals to human intuition, which even very smart people choose to resort to when they find themselves bombarded with factoids, numbers and other excessive information, some of which might be relevant and some of which might not be.

When we look around today and see that Uber is valued at 60 billion dollar, while Airbnb is valued at 30 billion dollar, we have to ask ourselves what the consequences are of unrealistic valuations like these. They're a product of a situation in which people are forced by central authorities to continue to engage in economic activity, even in a situation where there is no reason to expect the activities themselves to genuinely benefit anybody in the long run.

This hasn't just happened to Uber and other internet companies. Today's speculative energy companies are a product of the same mentality. Tesla is valued at billions of dollars, despite never having made a profit even as it receives massive government subsidies. Shale oil companies could borrow billions of dollars, despite never managing to turn a profit.

Just because something is physically possible doesn't make it a sustainable business model. Given enough subsidies and investors money to squander, I could grow wheat in large buildings with LED lights for you. It would be a tremendous unsustainable waste of energy, but it would be perfectly possible. If I could convince you that costs will go down in the future, I might manage to fool investors and governments into handing me more money. I might even manage to find a demographic of economic elites, who are willing to pay extra money for an economically uncompetitive product, because it allows them to virtue signal to other people that they made a decision that helps the Earth.

I think you will find eventually that our distorted investment environment leads us to believe that economic activities that are unsustainable are in fact the wave of the future. Consider that the largest renewable energy company in the world [went bankrupt in April of 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunEdison). What does that mean? It means that those who lent money to the company made a mistake, imagining a business model to be viable that really wasn't. 

For SunEdison to go bankrupt means it must have sold its products at a price for which it could not produce them. If you got solar panels for a low price from them, you did so by virtue of the mistake of investors who wasted their own money. The price of a solar panel is itself the product of a self-fulfilling prophecy: If we expect solar panels to become cheaper, we expect them to end up dominating the market, which means it's a good decision to invest in renewable energy companies. If we invest in renewable energy companies, we give them money with which to pay their personnel, sell their product at prices that undercut their competitors and maintain a business model that is not yet profitable, but *might* be in the future. Thus by virtue of our belief that solar panels will become cheap, they become cheap.

It seems to me, that renewable energy, like unconventional oil, Sillicon Valley tech startups, college and so many other aspects of the modern economy, suffers from an exuberant belief in their potential to radically transform our world. As a result, we may find that resources currently suffer from misallocation. If this happens, it means that the right side of the curve of resources is now being used in an inefficient manner. It's a bit like thinking that we can get through a famine by taking our bread and feeding it to our cow, so that the cow produces more milk. What happens in reality is that the whole system comes crashing down even faster as a consequence.","2016-09-19 17:24:56","52","20","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/53iop0/resource_misallocation_and_its_effect_on_the/","True","-triggerexpert-","1747859432.59087","zero waste","manual"
