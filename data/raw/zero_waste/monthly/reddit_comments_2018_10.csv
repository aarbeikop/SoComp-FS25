Overpopulation is a discredited paradigm. It’s a capitalist meme. It’s racist, xenophobic, jingoistic etc. Immigration is a good thing.

I’m starting to believe that urban lifestyles prevent comprehension of the realities of limits.","2018-10-25 19:37:04","10","[deleted]","1747884401.316891","zero waste","manual"
"e8gl1a2","t3_9rcljp","9rcljp","collapse","skeptical","The idea that immigration is ""unavoidable"" is propaganda by big business who wants as many immigrants as possible to drive down wages and increase consumption.

More mouths to feed on a fixed amount of natural resources + more people to fight for those resources when a shortage inevitably happens is not desirable in any way.","2018-10-26 00:36:36","5","SoraTheEvil","1747884401.319315","zero waste","manual"
"e8fuo6c","t3_9rcljp","9rcljp","collapse","skeptical","If anything, the evidence that you have provided here does shows that population reduction is a very important aspect of addressing climate change, in conjuction with massive reductions in consumption (and energy use). This will entail the ""developed"" world to undergo large scale consumption reduction, and the ""developing"" world putting a hard cap on the quality of life they are aiming to attain. In addition, both the developing and developed world needs to integrate depopulation plans into the overall strategy to address climate change.

"e8gcmki","t3_9rcljp","9rcljp","collapse","skeptical",">First, as an issue of source-knowledge, we should be skeptical of the green anti-immigrants and anti-population folks such as Tanton, Hardin, and Ehrlich. They were kicked out of the Sierra Club for a reason, and it's not ""political correctness.""

It very much was -- the Sierra Club consisted of the kind of people more committed to maintaining their upper class status than to actually doing anything about the environment, which is why they abandoned the environment once it threatened to hurt their social status by becoming too inconvenient of a topic. 

But that is besides the point. More importantly:

>As an issue of political correctness, it's really not that scary to denounce green anti-immigrant hysteria for what it is. It is racist, and Malcolm King articulates the history well (https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/rise-populationists-greenwashes-racism )

Even if those people were racist, racism is of utterly trivial significance compared to the consequences of overpopulation. 

The complete extermination, enslavement, subjugation, any other kind of mistreatment, of any subgroup of humanity, no matter how large, is an entirely acceptable price to pay if global civlizational collapse is to be averted. 

Because, and people really need to understand it very well, there will not be another advanced civilization on this planet once we are done. The concentrated resources we used to build ours will have been used up and environment will be too degraded. ","2018-10-25 22:25:01","2","gkm64","1747884401.325971","zero waste","manual"
