"dbuybu8","t3_5ldfbb","5ldfbb","collapse","skeptical","This ""media narrative"" thing is way overbaked. Your argument (not original) is that we are all being manipulated by the media and that Trump may actually be well-informed and reasonable. He is a billionaire after all, and a successful TV star. How dumb can he be?

However, I (like many people I assume) made my own assessment by watching the debates and reading his tweets - no media interpretation necessary there. My conclusion: the guy is an ignorant buffoon, a narcissist and a pathological liar. 

The fact that the media narratives agree with me is reassuring, but I came to my conclusions independently. There is definitely manipulation going on, but it not where you think it is.

Even if you disagree with the OP, his post is well thought out and the OP appears to be coming at it from an intellectually honest perspective.

I'm not a fan of the Reddit culture of down voting just because you disagree with someone. We should encourage people to form their opinions in a well thought out way as opposed to a knee-jerk soundbite reaction way which has become the norm.

It should be encouraged that when people disagree with each other they write long, well thought out, honest posts. Down voting the OP just because you disagree with him shows that you aren't really interested in having serious discussions with anybody you disagree with.

And it's kinda ironic that people in this subreddit hold this attitude, since a significant part of civilizational collapse is when people of opposing view points can no longer talk to each other because neither side wants to listen to anyone who disagrees with them.

I'm disappointed, I thought people on this subreddit would have been better than this and up voted the OP even if they disagree with him.","2017-01-01 06:53:52","8","[deleted]","1747867496.65362","zero waste","manual"

Trump is well known for getting on twitter at 3 AM and running his mouth over inconsequential bullshit. That indicates piss poor impulse control. That's not the media brainwashing me. I don't even have cable. 

>If you want a better view of who Trump is - read things a few years BEFORE the presidential run. Before the media wanted to influence you about him.

""I was prepared to like him as I boarded his black 727 at La Guardia for the flight to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home—prepared to discover that his over-the-top public persona was a clever pose. That underneath was an ironic wit, an ordinary but clever guy. But no. With Trump, what you see is what you get. His behavior was cringe-worthy. He showed off the gilded interior of his plane—calling me over to inspect a Renoir on its walls, beckoning me to lean in closely to see . . . what? The luminosity of the brush strokes? The masterly use of color? No. The signature. “Worth $10 million,” he told me. Time after time the stories he told me didn’t check out, from Michael Jackson’s romantic weekend at Mar-a-Lago with his then wife Lisa Marie Presley (they stayed at opposite ends of the estate) to the rug in one bedroom he said was designed by Walt Disney when he was 18 (it wasn’t) to the strength of his marriage to Maples (they would split months later).""","2017-01-01 04:07:47","4","mcapello","1747867496.669368","zero waste","manual"

"dbv1q8s","t3_5ldfbb","5ldfbb","collapse","skeptical","I think you have it backwards. The media is interested in whatever will get the most views and clicks, and they will bend the truth in order to get them. Trump was a godsend because he did their job for them. Did you not read all the insane, moronic, childish, anti-intellectual garbage that spewed from his beak during the election process? This stuff  came directly from Trump, not 'the media'. I watched the debates, I read his tweets...the man is a idiotic, overgrown man-child.

"dbv7jrl","t3_5ldfbb","5ldfbb","collapse","skeptical","I agree with Thecalculatorman's response to the OP, which is that this is an intellectually honest perspective on Trump.

I see the election of Trump through the prism of collapse, not left/right. He is what you would expect from a society/economy which is struggling against the warning signs of collapse, but doesn't want to see it, and gravitates towards a leader who promises there are no hard choices, that we can keep having it all, forever. That the ailments are systemic only is much as the system (free market capitalism) is not being allowed to unleash its full potential. It is being held back by regulations (on energy, specifically coal), by foreigners (China, Mexico), and by the shadowy elite. In this way Trump (and similar leaders using this rhetoric) can speak to people's deep psychological need not to see their own behaviour and choices as things to change. That the system really does work, but the rules governing it need shifting so it can really kick into top gear. It's the old story of the future being better than the past. No one gets elected telling a story about a worse future. No one gets elected telling the truth. And really, in all this chatter about fake news, the idea sold by Trump (one sold by all would-be politicians) that the future can be better is the ultimate fake.
