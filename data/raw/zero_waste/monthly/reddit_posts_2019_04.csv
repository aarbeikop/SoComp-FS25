"b932rq","environment","emotional","Let's start a discussion","Here's somewhat of a long backstory....For the past couple years I've been trying to live a ""zero"" or ""low"" waste lifestyle. For anyone who doesn't know this means that you create zero or a very small amount of your own personal trash and waste. So, nothing gets thrown in the garbage, everything you produce (if you produce anything) is either recycled, composted, or reused. I just moved to an area that does not publicly offer any services of recycling or composting anywhere. This is a huge, ""culture shock"" for me, so now I am really curious to know different opinions on living zero/low waste or on even recycling in general. How do you guys contribute to being zero/low waste? Why do you think it's important to live zero/low waste? If you don't I'm curious to know the different reasoning behind it.","2019-04-03 20:14:28","2","4","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/b932rq/lets_start_a_discussion/","True","strawlesshag","1747888617.607659","zero waste","manual"
"bbikiz","environment","emotional","Scientists need to invest in sustainable living instead of advanced technology and Space stations","i request all the techie experts to use their expertise in finding sustainable products or zero waste products as we already have more than enough technology to live happily.

Its already very late as so many living things are going extinct and many marine animals are dying of micro-plastics and undigested plastic packaging 

Do they deserve it ?? absolutely NOOO","2019-04-10 06:03:52","6","3","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bbikiz/scientists_need_to_invest_in_sustainable_living/","True","Soujanya7789","1747888622.7431521","zero waste","manual"
