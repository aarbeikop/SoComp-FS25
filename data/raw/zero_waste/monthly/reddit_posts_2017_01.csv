"5m44xi","environment","emotional","Documentary ""Plastic China""","Hello everyone!

I'm writing to recommend the documentary Plastic China. The film tells the heart-wrenching story of Chinese families who suffer from imported plastic waste. It left me in shock and urged me to reach out to related online communities. I hope that you will spread its message with your friends and families, raise awareness and shed more light on the ugly truth behind recycling plastic.

Americans commonly believe that Recycling is a great way to reduce waste (so did I). But it is actually an unpredictable solution with way too many variables (see Bea Johnson's TEDxMünster talk). As shown in the film, imported plastic waste has caused tremendous harm to humans and the environment in Mainland China. According to the director Jiuliang Wang, 1,250,000 tons of plastic waste were shipped from California to China to be further processed just in 2011.

It's not news that developed countries have benefited from exploiting developing countries. Still, it breaks my heart watching the irreparable damage done to my motherland and its people. It's important to educate ourselves on the global consequences of our actions, and the need to do so is ever so urgent in the polarized world we live in after 2016. This documentary will invite more people to reconsider their lifestyle choices and encourage them to adopt a zero waste lifestyle. I sincerely hope that you could take the time to watch and share it with your audience. 

Plastic China has won prizes at the IDFA and will make its North American debut at Sundance soon, although further distribution is unclear at this point. You can find the main trailer here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Kif9cugQ0) and watch the condensed version (26min, full length is 81min) here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbUPniM86G8) or here (https://v.qq.com/x/page/z0360ae4w57.html). You can also find more information on the film's official website (http://www.plasticchina.org).

"5ldfbb","collapse","skeptical","Donald Trump - Deeper character than buffoon?","This thread is collapse related, and looks at how the ""collapse narrative"" will be controlled by the media.         
We'll be looking at the clearest and most recent media narrative we have, and looking a bit closer at it, to see how the narrative was constructed.            
You may find you have an emotional response - that's what the media's done to you. You've been ""programmed"" just like the CIA has talked about. Try and relax with an open mind and keep reading.        
I'll talk about how you can deprogram the media influence on your opinions and thoughts.          
So, let's get to it.          

I read on a thread just now:

>Trump is a person with poor impulse control who lashes out will little provocation.

The things he's *said* while he was running for president, and after being elected certainly agree with this assessment. The media's been fast to report everything he's said during this election. We know all about him.

But we've got 70 years of Trump history, and the election is a very high stakes game, seeing a person reported on during the election is to see a tiny part of 70 years worth of history. It's likely the 3 years of election news would give an inaccurate and incomplete view even if there was no reason to control peoples opinions.

What about his school years? His teens, his 20's? What were his business deals, how has he spent his money, how has he acted when dating his future wives, how has he looked after his kids?

He's got a public persona, a clown persona. He's convinced everyone this is ALL he is, the media ran with this, and added their own narrative on top.

I've been done over by confident tricksters, and con artists many years ago. Ok, twice. Guess what?

Both lowered their social/intelligence appearance when dealing with their marks -  and from what I've read since, *people believe someone is stupid far too easily.*

They then let their guard down, and stop looking for more complex motivations by the confidence trickster. The trickster then is able to manipulate tham and the situation so much more easily.

I get this feeling with Donald Trump.

Not controlling your impulses and having money would have given us a history of Trump where he's spent money on fast cars, got multiple speeding fines, crashes, wasted money on massive parties and other no-return spending. He'd have kids in care perhaps.       
Chances are with poor impulse control and saying whatever he thinks would likely mean he's got no money and become personally bankrupt. (Company bankruptcy is different to personal bankruptcy)

Is he a mad skilled businessman? No, he doesn't look it based on the returns he's got on his endeavours.

Is he a sociopath? I can't tell based on what I've read, there's not enough to go on that would show signs.

Is he a narcissist? It looks that way... but people with money seem to get ego expansion. George Soros likens himself to God for instance.

Is he stupid? No. Forget what you know since the election run. Go back in history and see what he was doing. He's a mediocre socialite, had fun with his money, did some charitable works, made some interesting interviews, won an award or two.

The media hasn't mentioned these areas of his life, as they didn't serve the medias narrative. The persona Trump has put on certainly helped the media narrative they wanted to present, so we've had a mix of media narrative and persona... perhaps we don't know much about the person at all?        
Time to look at the past news, decades of it.

All I want to say in conclusion:

Stop thinking in polarised ways - if you're doing that you've been controlled.          
Normally you learn about the pros and cons of something gradually, you have several points of view you can take. You can analyse them.       
But if you start from  a completely polarised position, you've been given propoganda - controlled information.           

The best polarised example is Hitler..... (Godwin! Woo! Means I just anti godwinned)... people were often surprised after the war that he liked painting, he started the No-smoking laws in Germany, he ran for a Socialist party, he was a vegetarian...

He was a person - with pro's and con's in his personality. Obviously his con's completely overwhelmed his pros... 

But now compare with Trump - he isn't Hitler, therefore his pro's are more balanced to his con's.... but you don't know any of his ""pro's"" from the media! You're letting yourself be manipulated into polarised hate, and the end of analysis.           

It's MUCH more than Trump - the media does this for EVERYONE.

Go back and read that last sentence again. You believe Trump has no good qualities, that came from the media. What other beliefs about people and situations have been shaped by the media?   

ALL of them.

If you want a better view of who Trump is - read things a few years BEFORE the presidential run. Before the media wanted to influence you about him.              
I'm NOT saying your view of him will be favourable, it probably won't - he's part of the point zero one percent elite after all.

What? He is? Of course. He's a billionaire. The media DIDN'T push the ""Trump is the 0.01% elite you HATE!"". Bankers, CEO's, he's part of all that - it was an EASY and TRUE accusation/assessment. Why didn't you hear this? Because the media know future presidents are likely to be of the same 0.01% elites, and they don't want people hating on them in the future, because that's where they'll get their money from.

So if you read Trumps past, and remember he's a 0.01%er, you'll get your OWN opinion of him, not a media provided one. It will be more accurate than one based on election media has given.

In 2017 - do this for other important news. Russia and  Syria, Europe, Brexit, immigration, right to bare arms news. Food scarcity, climate change reports, riots, civil wars, pandemic reports, false flags.... dig back through news before the news realised it needed to spin those events. Learn more.....

Journalists are now a rare breed - we have hacks. Left, right, center, alt-right, alt-left, democrats, republicans spin it all. RT, CBN, CNN, MSNBC, 1nfoWars, G-LP....  The truth will be somewhere between them all. I'd be tempted to say read tweets ""on the ground"" before the media gets to it.

#Derail the media narrative.

#Be informed.

#Have a great 2017.
