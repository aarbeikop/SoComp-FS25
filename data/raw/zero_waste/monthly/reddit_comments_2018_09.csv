When we can quite probably imagine the end of civilization or even our own extinction within a couple of generations.  Is anyone studying the collective psychological effects such an existential threat is having on the culture as a whole and the kind of obstacles that collective trauma is creating in hampering efforts to solve this?   As a species are we all just going to throw our hands up in the air and say oh well?  Some days I'm so thankful I don't have kids.","2018-09-28 12:15:00","1","pomod","1747883433.39155","zero waste","manual"

Ehhh this isn’t exactly true, our resident Italian professor Ugo Bardi mentioned here that the work being done at ASU (https://cnce.engineering.asu.edu) is farther along than he expected (he was at presentation done by their director) and is cautiously optimistic about it.

Personally, it is one thing for it to work, with limited energy consumption, but another to scale it up enough to make a difference. ","2018-09-28 12:52:28","4","[deleted]","1747883650.931041","zero waste","manual"
