Hi Sustainable redditors!

I’m a zero waste designer and researcher based in Wellington, New Zealand. I’m currently exploring materials and manufacturing processes to eliminate waste in how stuff is made.

We are sucking, digging, felling and taking resources from the earth at an increasing rate. Oil is predicted to last up until 2040, past that, it is an uncertain future. This means that at some point we will have no choice but to find other means to produce consumer items. By this time, it might very well be too late.

We are all trying to do our bit to help save the planet right now, but it isn’t quite working fast enough. Without zero waste systems implemented at the top of the spectrum, with big manufacturers of goods, wasteful consumer products are going to keep flying out of factories. Did you know that 80% of manufactured goods will be disposed of within the first 6 months of its life? This is a shocking statistic, as so many materials such as plastic can last forever.

As long as stuff is getting made, waste will continue to be generated. But that waste can be minimised or even eliminated through innovative zero waste processes. Yes plastic is bad, but now that so much of it has been made, there’s not much we can do about it apart from limiting the amount of new plastic being produced. 94% of resources extracted out of the ground becomes waste before any product even gets produced! Instead of drilling for oil, we should be mining landfills instead! Like all this plastic is just sitting there ready to make things out of.

We're in the process of designing a series of chairs that are icons of zero waste design and manufacturing. In doing so, We need to understand more about how you are implementing zero waste into your everyday lives. Linked above is a survey that shouldn't take more than 5 mins to complete (mostly multi-choice questions).

I'd like to link you our facebook page also. Here you are able to follow our progress through this research project in designing a sustainable future.

Thank you all,
