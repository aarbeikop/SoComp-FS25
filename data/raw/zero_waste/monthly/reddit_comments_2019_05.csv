The majority of people couldn't give up just this one thing and even when biodegradable straws were introduced there was a bunch of whining about how they got a bit soggy.  As a society we can't even make this one simple change.  Only catastrophe will bring people around and even that might be iffy.","2019-05-23 16:56:21","25","TrueRekkin","1747889480.6643891","zero waste","manual"

"eoirlpf","t3_bs3wkz","bs3wkz","collapse","skeptical","Shouldn't expect anything different.  There's a constant push and pull between the individual and the collective, and if you push too much on the individual, they're going to push back.  People want increased options.  Come up with a better system today, and they'll be fine.  However, if someone feels they need to be able to get to their kid for whatever reason, and your new/old idea makes it more inconvenient to do so in the here and now, they're not going to go along with you.

Yes, people like short term convenience.  It's just how it is.  They like having the ability to do things themselves.  It's just how it is.  People also like some benefits that come from pooling resources.  People also don't like the cost or downside of any of the above.  Not everyone lives in the same place.  Not everyone has the same life.  Things are complicated because so many variables have to be taken into account.

Conversations won't get far if you tell other people you have to take things away from them.  They never really have.  Usually that ends up in an endless argument that solves nothing, or taken a few steps further, violence.","2019-05-23 15:38:09","6","The2ndWheel","1747889480.678875","zero waste","manual"

"eolzm42","t3_bs3wkz","bs3wkz","collapse","skeptical","The shift has to happen on a basic level. Industry has to go clean. Transportation has to go clean. Manufacturing, etc. That all pretty much can't happen in capitalism, because it's cheaper to pollute. Sustainability should be the #1 demand of any process, followed by anything else; now, it's not even an afterthought. 

What individual persons do is immaterial - and arguably if we went from an ownership economy to an access economy (where you get access to the things you need, not ownership of them) we could slash our resource use dramatically without having to live like it was the dark ages. 

But discussing piecemeal efforts inside the framework of capitalism is just ridiculous. It won't do shit to save our species.","2019-05-24 06:24:07","2","cr0ft","1747889480.69044","zero waste","manual"

"epoa1nl","t3_bvcaue","bvcaue","collapse","skeptical","Technology will solve the flight problem sooner than later. There are over 100 companies working on commercial electric aircraft. They will begin making commercial flights in 2020, and by 2025 the range will be 1000 miles and by 2030 range to anywhere. The only slowdown will be rate of adoption since old planes last a long time. There will also be electric/hydrogen planes using solar-generated hydrogen, this already exists. All in all, the technology exists to make CO2 ""free"" air travel, it only needs to be built and adopted.

But none of this matters. In a single year, China added enough new coal capacity to equal the emissions of the entire world's airfleet. Imagine if we doubled the number of airplanes in a single year, this is China's insane growth.","2019-05-31 22:14:17","-2","FF00A7","1747889599.686625","zero waste","manual"
