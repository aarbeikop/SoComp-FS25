"cjl539","climate","scientific","Genuinely interested about your opinions--not looking to argue","I love Jubilee's Middle Ground videos on YouTube, and they recently came out with one concerning climate change. For some background, I'm very strong for changing our lifestyles to combat climate change. I'm by no means zero waste, but I am working hard to make my impact as minimal as possible. In the next few months, I'll have the wonderful opportunity to spend some time in socialist countries where fighting for a clean environment is very prominent and practiced.

In the video, one lady, who was a climate change skeptic, said that she fears for America's future because all these environmental regulations and rules are taking away our rights, and she's scared that this country will become socialist. My question is: what is so bad about socialism that just the word makes a lot of Americans anxious?

I don't want a fight in the comments, just your opinions. I want to be more educated on the topic :) Thanks!","2019-07-30 02:08:31","3","12","0.64","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/cjl539/genuinely_interested_about_your_opinionsnot/","True","MaraBrook","1747890799.7095559","zero waste","manual"
"cd5c99","environment","emotional","Nuclear waste","Why is only like 8 percent of nuclear material used and the other 92 percent is waste. 

Have we not figured how to use 100 percent of it.  It can be converted all to heat or some other energy.  Matter can’t be created or destroyed but it can be converted to energy.  Yes or no. 

Shouldn’t we concentrate on creating things that can save and help the world or destruction is the only way to profit. 

Remember when appliances lasted a lifetime. Guess it’s better to make garbage so we can keep consuming and making waste.  

Everything should leave no waste no trace that we were ever there.  That is technology.  What we are doing lacks logic and intelligence.  Do you buy a bag of potatoes keep one throw out the rest.   Basically it’s what we are doing.  I have  seen ppl order meals eat 1/4 of it throw the rest out so I guess we have some wasteful ppl in the world.  No wonder it’s all screwed up. 

Capitalism and saving the environment can never work.  One demands making garbage constantly for profits which means a steady stream of waste.  The other is using all resources to its maximum with almost zero waste.     Really don’t get it.","2019-07-14 17:02:02","2","1","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/cd5c99/nuclear_waste/","True","truth-sucks-","1747890900.024931","zero waste","manual"
"ccin7u","environment","emotional","subreddit for products?","First time poster here.  I was wondering if anyone knows of a subreddit that is geared toward environmentally-minded products (eg. sustainable, fair trade, made with natural fibers, etc.)?  I am aware of r/ZeroWaste and r/BuyItForLife but those aren't exactly what I'm looking for.  It seems as though r/environment is more geared towards policy and politics.","2019-07-13 00:02:15","2","0","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/ccin7u/subreddit_for_products/","True","botanygeek","1747890907.4761758","zero waste","manual"
"cchmd1","environment","emotional","I am trying to understand the challenges of a Environmentally conscious lifestyle for School","Hi everyone, I am a student of George Mason University doing a research on the accessibility and challenges consumers face when buying eco-friendly/ zero-waste products. It only has a few questions and should take no longer than 10 minutes.
