"7b6apr","sustainability","action-oriented","One way of living more sustainably is by being more mindful of the waste that you produce. You should check out /r/ZeroWaste where it is discussed in greater detail!","*Full disclosure: I am a moderator of /r/ZeroWaste and /r/sustainability.*

I believe that /r/ZeroWaste is a great community for exploring deeper into ways of reducing your waste and your footprint on the world. 

The sidebar description:
>Being ""zero waste"" means that we adopt steps towards **reducing** personal waste and **minimizing** environmental impact. The zero waste ideal is to send nothing to landfills or high-temperature incineration facilities and to prevent unnecessary pollution and the squandering of nonrenewable resources.

> This community is for those who are interested in living a low- or zero-waste lifestyle. There is a major focus on the ""5 R's"", being refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot. We follow this by reducing consumption, choosing reusable and sustainably-produced goods, promoting recycling and composting, and encouraging each other in our attempts to live more sustainably. 

The community has grown significantly in the last year and has cultivated countless insightful discussions and ideas.
