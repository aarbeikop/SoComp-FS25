"9tekd9","sustainability","action-oriented","I’m the head moderator of /r/ZeroWaste, which just recently passed 80,000 subscribers. In what ways can the community do better?","Yes, I’ve heard all of the criticisms of /r/ZeroWaste. That it’s not doing enough, that it’s focusing on the wrong things, that lifestyle emissions aren’t the main source of our problems, etc.

How can it do more, focus on the correct things, and make a bigger impact on non-personal emissions?

I focused on growing it when other subreddits weren’t providing much of an outlet for personal involvement beyond voting. Not that it isn’t important but people need more engagement than just around election times. 

Now that it’s much larger, how would you envision a community being more productive that is passionate about climate change mitigation/adaptation, general environmental awareness, and that is comprised of people willing to put in extra effort/make sacrifices to help the environment?

Does its message need to evolve?

How can the community be better organized? 

What would be good things to get the community to start doing or do more of? 

What else would you recommend?

Thanks for reading. I wanted to step out of the echo-chamber and ideally get constructive and productive suggestions for improvement.

"9whbgv","sustainability","action-oriented","In search of sustainable guys who would like to partake in an awareness raising Instagram initiative.","This isn't your typical sustainability post, but I thought I'd try my luck.

There are a lot of vocal and inspirational women involved in sustainability, particularly zero waste. And that's fantastic. While sustainable guys are out there too, I just don't see as much from them. I want to try to change that, through an Instagram handle called @sustainableguys.

Through @sustainableguys, I would like to share short stories from sustainable guys all around the world. Stories about why they choose to be sustainable, their favorite eco tip, etc - all with the goal of inspiring more guys to think green. 

In my sustainable pursuits, I always thought something like this would be helpful, so I'm going for it!

Are you a sustainable guy who would like to take part? 

Thanks for your consideration fellow greeners!","2018-11-12 19:40:53","45","35","0.96","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/9whbgv/in_search_of_sustainable_guys_who_would_like_to/","True","cdog47","1747885329.382925","zero waste","manual"
