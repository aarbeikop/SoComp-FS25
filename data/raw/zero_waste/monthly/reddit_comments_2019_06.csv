It's a great shop and well priced too because you're not paying for all the packaging.  It also exposed me to a greater variety of food which I was not aware of.

"es8w25o","t3_c6fhq4","c6fhq4","sustainability","action-oriented","Japan does that half-way, by selling shampoo refills in thin plastic pouches. It's a lot less waste than buying a whole new bottle, but not like a refill station would be.

The thing with refill stations, is that AFAIK they just don't sell product as well as individual, disposable packages. I don't know if it's because people think refill stations feel cheap, or unsanitary, or just feel more sophisticated buying a bottle that's ""just for me"". But we'd probably see more refill stations if they were as marketable. The problem with a lot of sustainability stuff is that it's seen by the majority as stuff just for ""tree huggers""; we need to find a way to make sustainable solutions ""cool"".","2019-06-28 10:30:34","7","silentstorm128","1747890565.4919019","zero waste","manual"

"es8mjfu","t3_c6fhq4","c6fhq4","sustainability","action-oriented","A couple things to consider are the waste of the packaging of the bulk item (bulk isn’t zero waste in that it’s still usually delivered to the store in a bag or some kind of packaging that’s dumped into the bin/machine and so on - we just don’t see it), and also the machine dispenser footprint (creation, delivery, maintenance footprint, electricity, upkeep parts, lifespan/replacement, even software is major footprint items). Not to say that it isn’t an improvement over different bulk processes, but just possible comparison points to consider against improved packaging — or implement those kinds of ideas in conjunction.","2019-06-28 06:36:45","2","teamweird","1747890565.495281","zero waste","manual"

"es8qouc","t3_c6fhq4","c6fhq4","sustainability","action-oriented",""" And that way it’s got zero packaging instead of just better packaging. It would also reduce waste, with people only getting as much as they need, rather than getting more than they can use and throwing out the rest. ""

&#x200B;

Companies who have their own packaging equipment often make more on the packaging than the product in them. Its also not thier problem once you have used it, and it goes into the recycling system. In Australia we have the  *Australian Packaging Covenant* Organisation (APCO) . A industry focused government backed organisation that requires any manufacturer (with branded produce up to AU$10 mill spend last time I looked) to have a plan for reducing packaging waste. Its not effective.  Plastic ling and cardboard walls can only be so thin before breaking.","2019-06-28 08:12:24","3","micmelb","1747890565.497659","zero waste","manual"

"es8s7fb","t3_c6fhq4","c6fhq4","sustainability","action-oriented","I would think that grocery stores wouldn’t like this strategy, because it’s in their incentive to sell you more food than you may need/want.

If you can choose the exact amount of food you get, they’ll likely lose out on profits. For example, let’s say I was really craving a bowl of cereal. In the current system that we have, I’d be forced to buy a whole box, paying ~$5 for the predetermined amount because that was my only option. If I was allowed to fill the amount on my own, I would maybe just choose one bowl of cereal, costing me something like $1. Grocery stores like the waste, because it forces you to buy in bulk in many cases and thus spend more money.

It’s unfortunate that their profit incentive may prevent more environmentally friendly practices, but I feel like this might be the thought process of some stores","2019-06-28 08:51:20","2","jglanoff","1747890565.4995258","zero waste","manual"
