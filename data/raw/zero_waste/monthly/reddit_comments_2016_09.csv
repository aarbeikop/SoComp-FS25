"d840yuq","t3_54qacl","54qacl","collapse","skeptical","Why have you been following potential collapse so closely over the years? I think a lot of people here are reluctant to admit that they kind of want collapse. Everyone here has different reasons for wanting it, but I would take a guess that people here are largely disappointed with Western culture and want to see it fail, as punishment for being so reckless.

When you're in a relationship, is it better to be blind to your partner's infidelity, or constantly paranoid that she/he is cheating on you? Note that both of those positions are deficient, with the blind person ignoring reality, and the paranoid one seeing disaster where there may be none.

We are obviously the latter, waiting for shit to hit the fan, knowing that things are going to go wrong, to verify our suspicions that we had all along. Oh, what a glorious day when we get to say 'I told you so' as the world burns. 

Given the apocalyptic predictions in this thread, I don't know why we're even discussing it. People here speak with such certainty about the impending doom, that it seems pointless to even discuss it. If we're that fucked, then just live life now while it's good. But some people, I know I am one of them, secretly hope for collapse because something better might come out on the other side.

It's blind optimism, and probably has little foundation in reality. But there's no life without hope. And everyone here has a little hope. ","2016-09-27 12:54:07","21","[deleted]","1747859344.719966","zero waste","manual"
"d841pnb","t3_54qacl","54qacl","collapse","skeptical","There are a couple of problems that I can see with the link round-up posts.

First of all, if there's an interesting article among your links, I think it deserves individual discussion. If the link has been posted in your summary already, people may be deterred from posting it as its own thread.

Second, the discussion in the link round-up posts is, by necessity, even more unfocused than things tend to be around here. One link at a time, or a series of links illustrating an argument, lets a discussion revolve around a central theme.

Finally, I think posting a big batch of links tends to make each of the links seem less interesting. If you're just putting together a bunch of vaguely collapse-related stuff, and it's going to happen every day, and there's no way to tell which of the links you were interested in, it just turns into a pile of depressing news. 

It's also impossible to distinguish which stories really mattered to people; it invalidates the upvote system.

I would suggest simply not posting as many links here; just post what you think people will be most interested in, once or twice a day. It lets people know what you personally are interested, instead of you taking on the role of collapse archivist.","2016-09-27 13:17:11","18","MrVisible","1747859344.721948","zero waste","manual"

Well that escalated quickly.

I think population control (reducing the number of births per woman) + a vegetarian lifestyle + a switch to more sustainable sources of energy + a change of economic system would really do the trick. Out of these, the only one that's really hard is the change in economic system because it would require a huge change in mentality.

Why ? They don't contribute to the problem.  80% of emisisons are from the richest 20%, as is the vast majority of consumption.   A forest tribe in the Congo can keep doing exactly what they're doing and how they've been doing it, it's us fucktards in the developed world that caused this cluster fuck.  Killing off the richest 20% would sure as hell slow things down BUT it is just kicking the can down the road because the real issue is human behaviour.

But our current terrorism trend is sort of the norm. In Western Europe we haven't yet come close to the peak amount of terror attacks in the 70s and 80s when Basque nationalists, communist terrorists and IRA all existed at the same time. [This article explains it well](http://qz.com/558597/charted-terror-attacks-in-western-europe-from-the-1970s-to-now/).

That was just for western Europe. North America also had separatists, communist terrorists, right wing/left wing terrorists, nationalists and all sorts of other groups carrying out bombings and kidnappings.

All I am saying is don't get too worked up over the fear-mongering, this is just sort of on par for our shittyness as humans and is far from anything we can't handle.

"d853pov","t3_54qacl","54qacl","collapse","skeptical","FWIW, I appreciated your comprehensive set of links, giving a sense of where all this is at on a given day (even though I also agree with the POV that it may be better to drop one or two at a time to allow for more focused comment threads). 

On the ""waste of time"" thing you mentioned though... I don't think it was. 

I mean, in a sense, everything we do is a waste of time, since we're all just blowing time keeping ourselves entertained until we die, it's the nature of human life. 

I think it's like looking back on a relationship, regarding asking oneself whether it was time well spent (fun while it lasted) or a waste of time because it didn't work out. It got you here, it got you this far, it was entertaining, you learned things from it. 

Further, the intellectual skills and mental muscles you kept active in pursuing that, those things are useful in whatever you get into next. 

If you were reading financial collapse stuff while we were living in a reality that looks like a fusion-powered futurology fever dream, maybe then there would be a good argument for it not having been a wise use of time. However, even though the guys running those blogs are capitalist vultures and full of shit in some ways, the underlying message is still correct: that financial collapse is coming (although it's impossible to figure out when). 

Furthermore, the catalysts of that financial collapse are tied to other collapses that are coming (ecological, non-renewable resources, etc). The financial collapse stuff, like other niche collapse topics, are often the entry level to being able to absorb and accept the idea of a total collapse of everything we know on earth (that being, a mass extinction that take us with it).

 Like you, and like probably everyone here, I didn't start out at the conclusion of what we consider collapse now; rather, I started with following the lurching towards political collapse along with the sounding of the alarm regarding climate change in the early to mid 00s, then reading on the impending financial collapse and peak oil starting in the mid 00s, then back to climate change in the early 10s, then back to financial collapse, then the whole picture became clear to around 2012 or so. I've been looking into it ever since, and it keeps looking worse and worse. I didn't have it right every step of the way either. Don't be too hard on yourself for following a trail that didn't lead to a correct result, I think the experience of that makes one better at following trails and finding correct results.

I too spent a ton of time following collapse doomers. I still believe we are fucked. However, if we are fucked, I don't want to spend all time with people who get off on it.

Sometimes, you just have to slaughter the cow and make some hamburgers or plant something new to eat in addition to the milk you already have to drink.

By the way they do give awful advice like that to farmers sometimes.  It's stupid.
