"da05odh","t3_5cxcrk","5cxcrk","collapse","skeptical","A number of areas:

* **Gravel roads with natural drainage** - these shouldn't be the present-day major highways and interstates, but there should enough durable roads that it is possible to do regional travel/commerce a few decades after most road repair ceases. (FWIW, I think the interstates will be the last to go). It might also be worth looking into the old Roman roads; considering their durability, might be useful to see if it would be worthwhile to reproduce those. [The transition to gravel has already started, BTW (sorry about the pop up)](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/cash-strapped-towns-un-paving-roads-cant-afford-fix/)

* **Potable/drinkable water**: I don't have high hopes for infrastructure that must be moved through any sort of pipes or wires, but regardless of the pipes that bring people water, central water filtration facilities are vital to sustaining any sizable community. Any 21st century water plant *should* be able to run indefinitely entirely on locally-sourced materials, and independently of the power grid. Unlike electricity or heat/AC, there isn't much to fall back to when the centrally provided water utility fails, people will start drinking dirty water quickly, water-borne diseases will spread quickly. Unlike the loss of other utilities, with the loss of water it can go from calm to total societal breakdown and mass exodus in a matter of days. Even if many of the pipes to residences and businesses eventually fail, in every community there really ought to be a central location people can walk several miles to reach for clean potable water, even if they have to carry it back. I'm not sure that there is a plan for this, but there should be. The goal should be that these water collection and filtration facilities could operate at least 50 years after the breakdown of global and regional trade (ie. no dependence on parts from China or Mexico), and that they could operate in the absence of a reliable electric grid. 

* **Decentralized electricity production, diversified as widely as possible, and improved resiliency of the electric grid**: Generally, the idea here is to drastically increase the number of locations producing electricity, and to increase the variety of modes of production, with a goal of increased resiliency for the electric grid. 

* **A Department of Infrastructure in the federal, state, and local governments**: Currently there is an Office of Infrastructure under the Federal Highway Administration within the Department of Transportation, but you can see that it pertains to transportation infrastructure. IMO, several types of infrastructure (transportation, utilities, infrastructure involved in food production and distribution) are all vitally important and the upkeep of it as this century goes on will be difficult enough to justify raising it to the department level. We really can't afford to leave this in the hands of private industry assuming ""it's probably profitable, so someone will take care of it."" This imagined Dept. of Infrastructure would be less focused on upholding/enforcing the full scope of present-day regulations (as most departments are), rather it would be more focused on (in our words) making sure all states and counties have infrastructure that is ""collapse durable"". This would mean bringing back local production of the materials and parts needed; even if it's cheaper to source it abroad, IMO public utilities and infrastructure are too important to play capitalism with. It would also mean building resiliency and redundancy into current systems, so they have a functional state to fall back to rather than to fail entirely. 

Overall, I don't think collapse is avoidable, and IMO there will be a point where even if all the above was put into place even it would eventually fail, but I believe the crash landing can be softened considerably by getting started on durable resilient 21st century infrastructure.

No: because of the porous rock substrate, seawater will impinge from below as well as above.

Seawalls won't help without a lot of pumping the ocean back into the ocean.  And to have one levee pump, you have to have three levee pumps (one in service, one for fail-over, and one in maintenance)
