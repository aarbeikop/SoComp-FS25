Their motivations were to provide employment and to meet perceived needs. Clinton proposed $275 billion in spending, while Trump topped her, in his typical extravagant fashion, with a pledge of a trillion bucks. As always with Trump, read the fine print – much of this will be ‘spent’ as tax incentives to private entities. Still, his Progressive opposition has embraced increased infrastructure spending as a singular point of agreement. Congressional minority leaders Schumer and Pelosi would gladly accept funding to revamp NYC airports and the obsolescent mass transit system of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Master economist Jeffrey Sachs is also ready to jump on the new train:

>Donald Trump and the rebuilding of America

>This is a valid, indeed uplifting perspective. America desperately needs rebuilding. Its infrastructure is decrepit; its energy system is out of date for a climate-endangered economy; its Rust-Belt cities are boarded up; its inner cities are unhealthy for the children being raised in them. Rebuilding America’s inner cities and creating a 21st century infrastructure could be Trump’s greatest legacy.

>Trump’s pledge to make America’s infrastructure “second to none” is the correct and bold goal for America’s competitiveness, future job creation, and well-being. America today is certainly no longer “second to none.” On a recent Sustainable Development Goals Index, the United States ranked 22nd out of 34 high-income countries. For Americans returning from foreign travel, the well-known sign that they’ve touched down in America is that the elevators, escalators, and moving walkways of our once-proud airports are out of order.

Sachs browses the obvious wish list for sustainability: ‘smart’ electrical grid, improved rail transport, refurbishing urban water and sewers. He also points out the obvious caveat:

>Much could go wrong in an undirected building boom that is not smart, fair, and sustainable.

Such wrong-headed building is reported from London:

>London super-sewer is waste of £4bn, says assessor 

>The original assessor who backed plans for a multibillion-pound super-sewer beneath the river Thames has said his decision was based on incorrect information, as crews begin work on the project.

>The seven-year project – the biggest upgrade to the capital’s sewers since Joseph Bazalgette oversaw their construction in the 1850s – is intended to stop wastewater from overflowing into the Thames at times of heavy rainfall.

>Meanwhile, the National Audit Office (NAO), the government’s spending watchdog, has raised questions over a financial plan for the project that would leave taxpayers footing the bill in the event of cost overruns or a fresh crisis in global credit markets.
 
>A private company, set up by the government and Thames Water, will own, manage and finance the sewer during construction. One-third of the cost is being contributed by Thames Water, while the remaining £2.8bn will be raised from private investors.

>To encourage investors, they will receive an income from the project from the very start, while the government will indemnify them against a number of risks. When the tunnel is finished, the company will supply sewerage services to Thames Water on a 125-year concession, with the cost borne directly by customers through a fee added to bills.

I expect such ‘private investor funding’ is what Trump intends to sell us. Fine – let them build it, we can stop payments later. My questions are broader:

When the world has pledged to go to a zero (actually, negative) carbon economy by mid-century, there will be little in the carbon budget for air travel, so why spend a decade and billions to revamp international airports? Should we construct seawalls to protect Miami Beach real estate investments?  Need we fund ‘bridges to nowhere’, hoping to gain the votes of important, conservative, rural Congressmen?

**With view to Collapse, in what public infrastructure should we bother to invest?**
