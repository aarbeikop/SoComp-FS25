"ar25su","environment","emotional","Please give an argument againt: ""Nuclear is clean energy, and nuclear waste is a non-problem""","Over the past few years I've heard a lot of good things about nuclear energy, specifically using Thorium 232 instead of Uranium, but it seems like most people are still against it and I don't really know why.

My understanding is as follows:

* Nuclear fission produces zero greenhouse gases directly
* In total, including manufacturing and logistics etc, nuclear energy causes less CO2-equivalent emissions per kWh than even photovoltaic solar, and just about anything else that has the potential to provide the whole world's power
* PV-solar is the energy form with the highest CO2-equivalent emissions per kWh after natural gas and coal, which is due to the manufacturing process
* Nuclear energy is the safest form of energy, with US nuclear killing \~2,000,000 times less people per kWh than China coal power, and even \~50x less people per kWh than solar (somehow)
* Nuclear waste doesn't actually hurt anybody in anyway as long as you aren't close to it, as nuclear radiation is simply high energy particles just like a lightbulb would emit and becomes negligible due to the inverse square relation
* Thorium 232 fuel cycle uses a much greater percentage of the fuel than uranium and would reduce the problem of waste
* Nuclear waste as an issue could be easily dealt with by simply burying it several meters below the ground, perhaps in a mountain far away from society
* The only two real meltdowns of nuclear plants ever have been Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi, which ended up killing a total of 25 and 0 people, respectively
* Most people have a negative view of nuclear energy because of the terrible events following nuclear weapons testing, and an accidental correlation of nuclear weapons testing and nuclear energy
* Most countries are actively trying to get rid of their nuclear energy and I don't know why

The combination of these understandings leads me to believe that nuclear is the ideal solution over something like photovoltaic solar, and that for some strange reason there seems to be a large movement spreading misinformation to the general population.

*Edit: furthermore, not only does it seem like the ideal solution, but it seems like it would only take 5x or 10x as many nuclear plants as we have now to power the entire planet, and this seems very doable.*

&#x200B;

Can somebody please let me know if there is any evidence against these understandings? Are we missing something important that makes nuclear less ideal than solar for the future? Is it simply too expensive to build nuclear plants? Are there any new solar technologies in the works which will reduce the high relative pollution of solar panels as compared to other forms of clean energy?

I would really love for anybody to poke some holes in the argument above and prove any of those points wrong, because I am really confused as to why it seems like both the fossil fuel people and environmentalists are both trying to get rid of nuclear. It seems like the best of both worlds.

Thank you so very much if you read all of this, I know it's a bit messy. I appreciate any comments greatly.","2019-02-15 22:32:56","0","13","0.25","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/ar25su/please_give_an_argument_againt_nuclear_is_clean/","True","danieljamesblack","1747887104.57343","zero waste","manual"
"auzbaw","environment","emotional","Largest Company Providing Natural Gas for Vehicles Commits to 100% Renewable Natural Gas by 2025","As someone who is very concerned about climate change, I have become convinced that Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) is an essential component of getting to carbon neutral. It is collected from organic waste, stopping it from going directly into the atmosphere and, while chemically identical to fossil fuel natural gas, it involves zero releasing of fossilized carbon. We need natural gas to accomplish zero emission transportation, particularly for long-haul trucking, trains and ships where electric is not feasible (the weight of batteries and the time it takes to recharge or replace them, limits the range and load of battery powered vehicles). RNG is also cleaner than electric because it doesn't require the toxic waste associated with batteries and much electrical generation is not green. Anyway, I think we environmentalists need to get behind this movement.

Hi all!

I work in events for a local newspaper and would love to pitch an event for Earth Day. We do not have the funds for one so I would have to find sponsors or provide a seminar or panel of speakers. I would much rather have an event full of music, demonstrations, fun crafts, and other activities to make learning more engaging. I am wondering if someone here could help me brainstorm some ideas to help our Earth and those living on it.

Some general and topic ideas:

Recycling: Invite local waste management to discuss proper recycling methods and provide statistics.

Composting: Invite local garden center to demonstrate composting and, if possible, create a workshop where people can create their own composting systems.

Diet: Provide statistics on how diet change can not only help the environment but also one's health.

Lifestyle and zero/minimal waste: Instruct simple lifestyle changes to produce less waste to not only help the environment, but to also improve one's own health-mind,body, and soul. Educate about refusing and reusing.

Invite instructor to do yoga/meditation, free to the public.

Invite local artists to play acoustics

Work with local forest preserve to discuss invasive species and the importance of biodiversity and protection of local preserves. I also think this would be an ideal place to host such an event.

Invite vendors that showcase green practices. I would like to invite food vendors that promote sustainable packaging and vegan products.

Partner with local garden center to pass out pollinator friendly kits.

Any ideas or inspirations from what I've mentioned would be very much appreciated! I apologize if this isn't the right sub for this kind post and would love any suggestions for other subs that would be suitable for it.

I also posted this on r/vegan and /u/KhaoticKlit thought both subs could join forces to plan something together. I'm completely open to ideas.  

Thank you!","2019-02-01 18:18:42","2","5","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/am50hp/need_help_planning_earth_day_eventplease_help/","True","Nakittina","1747887676.3132339","zero waste","manual"
