Great idea, I’m from Bristol so hopefully be able to join you!

You should think about getting some companies on board to showcase their products at your festival! 

Home solar
Vertical farming
Zero waste recycling

Etc etc

Hope it goes well for you! ","2018-05-22 21:36:32","6","anonymousmice","1747880720.594841","zero waste","manual"

Keep doing what you're doing!","2018-05-29 02:21:51","1","kcass1","1747880720.605815","zero waste","manual"
