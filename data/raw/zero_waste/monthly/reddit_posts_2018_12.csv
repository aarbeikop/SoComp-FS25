"a3dj1t","collapse","skeptical","The Idiocy of Elon Musk","Recently I was watching the National Geographic show *Mars*, where Elon Musk figures prominently. Most of you know his whole philosophy with SpaceX and interplanetary exploration: he sees it as an essential safeguard in protecting the survival of the species.

And I was reflecting on how remarkably stupid and empty this view was. It's ironic, because caring about the survival of the species *appears* to be very far-sighted. After all, he's talking about projects that will take decades, maybe even centuries. The colonization of Mars to the point of being self-sufficient would be a major multi-generational undertaking with large upfront costs.

One SpaceX employee during the interviews called colonizing Mars an ""engineering problem"". But it's interesting how the scope of the engineering *takes the functioning of our current civilization for granted*. Yet any educated person, particularly anyone with a scientific education and a respect for engineering of any kind, must know with absolute certainty at this point that taking our current civilization for granted is *completely untenable*.

Essentially there are two conclusions one can draw from the fact that Elon Musk is investing in SpaceX, as opposed to a Manhattan project to find a clean energy source for the planet.

The first possibility is that Elon Musk realizes that our current civilization is going to collapse before we can solve the energy problem, and somehow thinks that he can get a self-sufficient colony on Mars before that happens. This seems like a monumentally risky bet.

The second possibility is that Elon Musk is an ignoramus and a science dilettante who is unaware of how unsustainable our current situation is, and in following a cult of optimism, meticulously surrounds himself with other people who are similarly ignorant. I don't know enough about Musk or his milieu to know if this is true, but it seems far more likely than the first possibility.

If you want to get to Mars, and if you want human beings to colonize space in a permanent way, you need to keep our current industrial civilization running for as long as it can. And it can'd do this using current methods.

Therefore, it's completely illogical to invest any money whatsoever into space exploration. Every penny should be spent on new energy development. Cheap, clean sources of energy would appear to be the only way we have any hope of maintaining the kind of global economy that is capable of producing the kind of surpluses needed to send people into space at a massive economic loss. It doesn't particularly matter if it's privately funded or funded by tax revenue. If the global economy goes into permanent decline, with the social crises that would inevitably follow, no one is going to be shitting away extra money to design 3D-printers for Mars or the landing systems needed to put humans there.

*Everything* needed to keep the global economy requires clean, cheap energy. Everything.

We're going to need carbon-neutral agricultural fertilizers to make enough food to feed the world. There's no way to do that without a clean energy source cheap enough to make those fertilizers affordable.

We're going to run out of metals and rare earths. Recycling them far more efficiently than we do today is the only way to keep that supply chain filled, and recycling is only economical if the energy required to process waste is extremely cheap.

We're going to run out of clean water. Huge swaths of the urbanized world have literally no plan to get themselves water for the near/medium-term future. Water recycling and desalination are both very energy-intensive.

And then there's the carbon question. We can't bring carbon emissions to zero without having a carbon-neutral energy source cheap enough to make carbon sequestration economically viable.

Basically, if you look at every major problem threatening our species and its ability to ever realistically colonize space, solving the energy issue is the key to all of them. 

Prioritizing spaceflight itself is completely illogical. Functional spaceflight technology without a civilization capable of sending people to space is useless. A civilization that's capable of sustainable energy surpluses without destroying the biosphere, on the other hand, can develop spaceflight technology at its own pace. 

It seems like people like Musk have totally miscalculated here. ","2018-12-05 15:55:52","41","82","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/a3dj1t/the_idiocy_of_elon_musk/","True","mcapello","1747885833.1874702","zero waste","manual"

What's the most sustainable way of bathing that's both good for you and the environment?
