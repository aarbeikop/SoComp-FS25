Using that as an excuse to say ""fuck it"" seems pretty sad, brother. We are mortals, but why should that stop you from trying for a life of excellence and meaning? I make a lot of choices built on my understanding that the way things are now are beyond broken, beyond repair, and likely to become much worse in my lifetime. I still want to be proud and rewarded by how I choose to spend my time, and I'm much happier for that than if I opted for hedonic escapism. 

What's that Beckett line? ""I can't go on. I'll go on."" That's where we're different. 

edit: you're right about getting rid of your job and your shit though. ","2017-12-07 21:37:29","54","[deleted]","1747876848.548049","zero waste","manual"

Their male counterparts withdrew completely, never engaging in courtship or fighting. They ate, drank, slept, and groomed themselves – all solitary pursuits. Sleek, healthy coats and an absence of scars characterized these males. They were dubbed ""the beautiful ones."" Breeding never resumed and behavior patterns were permanently changed.","2017-12-07 23:21:35","16","knuteknuteson","1747876848.549711","zero waste","manual"

But an advice, having worked in finance I have seen enough people going the drugs and sex/call-girl route. High rate of miserable people, even though they're usually great at hiding their inner emptiness.

Life is all about family and relationships. The fact that our days are likely numbered doesn't change that, on the contrary. Make every day count. 

Video-games and hard drugs should be very low on anyone's list IMO.

I decided to enroll in a certificate program in a more creative field while working part time at the same place I worked through college. I'm on board, just living life easily and not worrying much about the future at all.

Turn off the porn and watch a few chick flicks.

If guys want to date porn stars, girls want to date rom com stars.
