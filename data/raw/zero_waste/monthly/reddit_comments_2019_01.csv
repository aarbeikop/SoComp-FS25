As long as youre alive, you at least still have a chance to do something positive about things. No matter how little it counts in the end, you have at least done your part.

I am bit similarly disillusioned that we could ever stop what has already been set in motion by our society, lifestyles and economy in general. Money seems to rule everything and thus makes sustainability next to impossible. But we have to at least try to do our part. 

We must not give up, we must not let the greedy bastards in power to get away with destroying mankind so easily. We must at least make ourselves heard. If the corporations did similar actions as many of the individuals are doing, it would make a huge difference. Our voice is growing and people are starting more and more demand actions each day. At some point they will be impossible to ignore anymore. This is what we can and must do, no matter what the outcome is. We may not be able to stop the impending doom but we sure as hell wont go out quietly.

I don't like our economic system, and to be fair it is based on surreal principles, such as endless growth. However untill we change our economic structures, the best thing we can do is show ""the market"" we no longer blindly consume.
That sustainability can be 'profitable' (since that is their end goal obv)

And even though the average 'consumer' is by far not the biggest polluter; no rain drop tends to feel responsible for the flood.

I believe that everyone should apply as much sustainable principles as possible (regardless of the relative influence it has, unless negative of course).
For the main reason that if the current generations grow up in a world full of sustainable principle, sustainability will become a norm and compassion for the environment will become intrinsic.

"ees1pix","t3_aiy61m","aiy61m","collapse","skeptical","4 1/2 years ago, my partner and I decided to move to a rural community and commit to learning how to grow our own food/save seeds etc.  The impetus was to be more sustainable, but true sustainability is a pipe dream.  We practice permaculture, but still find ourselves reliant on using cheap energy to make our lives easier (chainsaws for example).  At the end of the day, accepting that doing better is better than doing nothing at all, it allows you to be effective instead of wallowing in the impossibility of living within this failing construct.  

Further, we have discovered that the path towards anything of meaning was to build towards community resiliency. Our community has a really nice pocket of folks (albeit a small percentage of the greater community) where barter, sharing of information, and volunteering of time are practiced.  I don’t know how things will shake out, but finding a small resilient community, or carving one out of your current locale, is probably the best way to put your energy into.  If anything, growing your own food from seeds you collect and trade within your community, using compost you build yourself, at the very least, affords you freedom from being dependent on the system.

I highly recommend folks out there who are interested in this lifestyle to seek out work-trade opportunities on small-scale homesteads/farms through wwoof or workaway.  It’s a great way to learn and seek out communities where this type of lifestyle is important.","2019-01-23 17:24:25","20","AmpLee","1747886611.77349","zero waste","manual"

But we don't lie down and die, just because we see our own deaths coming. We achieve this either by deluding ourselves or simply forgetting, but most of us manage. The death of our civilization doesn't need to be any different.

Here's the thing: no matter how conscious we are as individuals about where this is all headed, if we stop running with the herd we will be trampled. We've constructed a system in which participation in the apocalypse is not only rational, but mandatory. It's not *optional* to have a job, because we've decided as a society that our right to exist is proportional to the profitability of our skillset. That is, we've decided that homelessness and poverty are acceptable consequences of an inadequately funded welfare state. We'd rather buy that last Bic Mac than let a single mother of two have access to daycare. That is what we have decided.

So I have no illusions about the cruelty, stupidity, and ignorance of the common voter, but I still intend to have my kicks while I'm here. What I won't do is starve myself of all the perks of life in the West, because my non-participation isn't going to change a damn thing. People who say ""a little bit is better than nothing at all"" have never taken a course in real analysis. Some things are so negligible that they aren't even *measurable*. I will not martyr myself for an *immeasurably* small impact. The self-satisfaction - objectively the only thing such a sacrifice would achieve - will not outweigh the cost. It's a fatalistic view, but it's also liberating. It frees me of any delusions that I can make a difference. I am a cell in the superorganism, and the superorganism is going to kill itself whether I object or not. The ride's going to come to an end, one way or another, so I may as well put my feet up, have a drink, and enjoy the scenery.

Now, I'm a deeply troubled and depressed person for other reasons, but that's how I feel about it on an intellectual level. In reality, my dark moods sometimes manifest as ecological pessimism. But if I weren't a deeply closeted and confused trans person starved of meaningful human contact, that would probably be different. During past periods of happiness, I've managed to ""Live the Big Lie"" without too much trouble. And if I have any more happiness in my future, I'll be glad to put on my Big Lie smock and play along again.

I moved to a small agricultural community in the Peruvian Amazon for 8 months, to for a self-directed cultural immersion experience. I learned what it is like living with water scarcity, with absolute destitute conditions, etc. It was amazing, difficult, and freeing. 

I returned and found a job that allows me to be relatively outside of the system. I work somewhere powered by wind and solar. I consume very little, except for food and some fuel. 

I'm working on my land to get it more sustainable. Rainwater capture systems, expanding the garden ten-fold and working on small-scale solar for emergencies. 

What I have taken away from my experiences is that we need a balance. There no *point* in cutting yourself off from everything in order to have the smallest impact possible. It will make no difference in the larger path of humanity. One needs to find a balance within themselves around how much they cut out, and how much they keep, to maintain their internal moral/ethical equilibrium.

2. You learn valuable skills. Realising that I had no control over my food security is what made me want to homestead. If you can grow food, build and maintain things, are conscious of your waste and its disposal, you're much more resilient regardless of what happens on a grand scale. 

3. It reconnects you to your community. The market economy thrives on social atomisation. When people are disconnected from each other, they can't consolidate their power or effectively advocate for themselves. By reconnecting you become stronger than yourself.

For me the things that have helped put our predicament into perspective are astronomy and gardening.

Astronomy puts us in our place. We, and our civilization are less than a speck. Totally insignificant, doomed from the beginning. That’s the reality no matter how sweet the Star Trek siren song. Going to the stars was never anymore realistic than the Protestant Rapture.

Gardening gets us back to life’s cycles. It connects us with the soil and what keeps us alive.

Going green as it’s called is just a healthier lifestyle. A hot cup of coffee in the morning is small pleasure enjoyed almost everywhere. A Keurig is pointless. 

I try to keep morality out of the equation. While as individuals doing what we believe is morally the better choice, it never stays at that level. Ever. Once we, as individuals or as a group, decide that a particular course of action is the morally appropriate one, individual and collectively we become judgemental of others who don’t share our beliefs. And beliefs are all that they are. Worse, have ascribed morality to a particular course of action, we are even less inclined to change our behaviour even when confronted with objective facts that contradict our views. Tl;dr using morality to justify action leads to mischief and more problems than it solves.
