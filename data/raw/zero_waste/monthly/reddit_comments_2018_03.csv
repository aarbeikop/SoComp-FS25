Simplistically speaking, species seem hard-wired to consume all the energy available to them.   In the presence of abundant energy and few or no predators, their population numbers explode.   The population collapses when either the “food” is gone (fossil fuels in our case), or the waste products accumulate to the point that the wastes choke off more reproduction.   

Whether we starve first from rapid net energy decline from fossil fuels, or choke ourselves to death from waste products (CO2, plastics, petrochemical toxins, excess nitrogen, etc.) seems to be a close call at this point.   The above said, the human species cleverness, combined with the vast energy being released from millions of years of accumulated and process fossil sunlight, has resulted in an exponential growth phenomena that is impacting the entire planet and all other species.   We won’t kill the planet, but we might kill this biological epoch. 

There are a few folks who are working on alternative social and cultural approaches and narratives for a post peak post-industrial world.   Possibly a quasi- religious narrative with the environment or biology or energy at its center, to drive a different behaviors.  I am skeptical that cultural norms overrule the impact of the availability of energy in the environment.   Maybe we can genetically engineer a different human species who might behave differently?   Even so, the laws of thermodynamics will still apply.

Also when it screams I can turn it off... try doing that with a kid and you go to jail. My phone also doesn't clutter my house with crap and stink up the place.

"dwbnvfy","t3_87b8b7","87b8b7","sustainability","action-oriented","The first R is always ""refuse"" - the point of zero waste/low impact is to just not use stuff. Instead of metal or even compostable straws, just don't use a straw. This can be applied to a ton of things, so it's up to each person to determine what things they can kick out of their life while still taking care of themselves.

For things you do need, buy used. In this way, reusables are good because they have life past the original user.

Also, reusable items can be made from recycled materials. They aren't currently, but materials science could also help with that.

Composting is a great option, especially considering that eventually they will return to the earth (as opposed to things like plastic or metal that we can't ""put back""). The issue, however, is that it still takes a lot of energy/resources to MAKE that thing, to get back that thing, to sort what we get back, and then to produce the next material. I could use 4 compostable forks a week, or use ONE metal fork. Over a period of time, the reusable item would win out for the compostable item. If a reusable item won't make it to that time where it wins out, compostable would be the way.","2018-03-26 19:24:01","15","[deleted]","1747879232.102588","zero waste","manual"

I work in the culinary industry (former restaurant and bar owner now in event biz) and recommend a product line that replaces straws, plastic utensils, cups and plates with bio-based alternatives from palm leaves and sugarcane bagasse. Not sure if it's ok to name the brand on this sub but I'm doing it -- Natural Tableware. Really good-looking stuff. ","2018-03-26 21:51:10","3","[deleted]","1747879232.105071","zero waste","manual"
