The short version is that there is little to no demand in the job market that I know of for people with degrees in 'sustainability'.  You need to think about the types of jobs you might want, and then ask yourself how you would compare against other likely candidates.  

Admittedly I don't know much about Environmental Science programs specifically, it could be that they equip you with some of the specific knowledge and methodologies that people look for when hiring, say, municipal waste management staff.  The point, though, is just that you should be asking that sort of question.  A lot of people post disappointing experiences on here of doing things like getting a 'degree in sustainability', and then finding that when it comes to the job market, their qualifications always pale in comparison to those who have degrees/internships or work experience which are more directly related to the job.  Which makes sense, honestly.  If my company wants to place a more serious focus on LEED certification the next time it designs and builds a new building, is it going to hire someone with a degree in 'Sustainability'?  Of course not, it is going to hire someone with Facility Design and Construction qualifications but look for someone who has experience and a passion for sustainable practices.

Companies aren't really hiring many 'Sustainability' positions at this point (though it would be nice to see that become more common in future) - they are hiring people in engineering, procurement, marketing, research, all the things they would always hire people for, and then adding lines about sustainable practices to job descriptions and company mission statements.  Sustainability is at least somewhat hot right now in the job market from my experience, but in the sense that the right experience or qualification can make you stand out from other qualified candidates, not in the sense that it is the primary thing a lot of companies are looking for.  

As one specific piece of feedback, in your particular case I will step back and say that yes, wholeheartedly, Environmental Science sounds more likely to be marketable to employers than Creative Writing, so I would absolutely recommend you go that route if nothing else.","2016-03-23 13:28:41","2","reasondefies","1747852624.2105658","zero waste","manual"
"d19uvzz","t3_4bjpwy","4bjpwy","sustainability","action-oriented","I think that if you are really passionate about environmental studies, sustainability, climate change etc. and enjoy learning about it, an extra year would definitely be worth it. If your reason for sticking with creative writing is just that you've already done  two and a half years of it rather than that it's something you really love and want to pursue further, I'd say go for it!

Sure, you can always pursue this as a career after college, w/o the specific degree, but I think I'd rather get a degree in something that really engages me and makes me want to get involved. And honestly, changing your major partway through college isn't that crazy of idea; lots of people do it. I have friends who didn't really find their passion until later in college, but switching tracks was absolutely the right decision. You can always keep your journalism major and stay involved with the school paper too, it's not like you have to drop writing entirely. I can't speak to which schools or areas of focus would be best, but I think the extra year would be totally worthwhile :) ","2016-03-23 00:22:47","1","machete_scribe","1747852624.213512","zero waste","manual"
