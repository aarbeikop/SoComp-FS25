I am a junior in college and am studying abroad at the moment. I go to a small liberal arts school and had to declare my major early because I did the IB program in high school. Unfortunately, this meant I declared my major in creative writing, as it was something I had taken classes in and I had a professor that encouraged me to do so. While I enjoy creative writing to a certain extent, it's definitely not my passion and I don't get too much fulfillment from it. Plus, job outlooks are not the best for that field and I don't want to be a professor. I have a minor in journalism and have worked for my college's newspaper the whole time I've been at college. Again, I enjoy this, but I can definitely say it's not what I want to do with my life. I will be Editor-in-Chief of the paper next year though.

Flash forward to now. While studying abroad I've come to the realization that I'm incredibly interested in Environmental Studies. I took the intro class to the major my first term of college and enjoyed it. Sustainability and conservation are topics that I've always been really interested in. In my personal life, I am vegan and am trying to move toward a zero waste lifestyle and generally live in a more ethically and environmentally conscious manner.

Looking at my college's requirements, I could probably complete a ENVS major with just one extra year of school (so 5 years in undergrad rather than 4). I know that this is still a pretty new idea and I could possibly change my mind the more involved in it I get. I will be volunteering this summer at a small organic farm in my hometown (this is confirmed) and am looking into some other volunteer options in the community to pursue as well in order to get a better idea of what I might want to do and what my options could be. I am nearly done with my creative writing major and would be able to take mostly environmental studies classes in the fall and then just take one writing class to fulfill that requirement in case I decide to stick with it.

I guess my question is, is it worthwhile to spend an extra year getting a degree in Environmental Studies? Would I be better off doing this at a larger university or state school, which might take longer but could be cheaper? (I know the university in my home state has an Environmental Science major that focuses a lot on geology.) Or would I be better off just majoring in creative writing and trying to get into work in conservation or sustainability just through volunteering, doing internships and making connections? Is there a certain area in the field that is especially ""hot"" right now and would be worth pursuing volunteer work in to build up my experience and network?

Any advice that you might have would be enormously appreciated. Sorry this is a pretty long post.","2016-03-22 22:18:15","4","2","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4bjpwy/seeking_schoolcareer_advice/","True","r2design","1747852621.033238","zero waste","manual"
