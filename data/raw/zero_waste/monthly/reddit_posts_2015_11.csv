"3rfald","sustainability","action-oriented","Best documentary for someone who doesn't really care about the environment?","I've moved back home and my mother and I clash horribly on how we want to live. I try to be zero waste as possible, she prefers drinking out of plastic bottles and gets take out for every lunch. I've been 'teaching' her how to recycle for nearly 8 months now and she refuses to pay attention. I have to comb through the recycling and trash every night to make sure it was done properly. She's not being purposefully mean or anything. She's just incredibly lazy, and stuck in her ways and she doesn't connect how her actions could have an affect. 

So tell me, is there a documentary that could help me change her mind?? I feel like if I just show her how the situation actually is, and could connect her lifestyle to it then it would galvanize her to change.","2015-11-04 00:05:37","3","3","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/3rfald/best_documentary_for_someone_who_doesnt_really/","True","planethugger","1747847879.9312901","zero waste","manual"
