I'm not sure this falls exactly under zero waste, but I think you all should have some good ideas. I need to buy some new men's underwear, but I want to buy them from somewhere that is at least ethical, if not zero waste. I normally buy my clothes at the thrift store, but that doesn't really work for underwear. I have found https://wearpact.com/ so far, but I am looking for more options. Anyone have any good ideas or other places I could ask? How do you buy undies if not from a giant retailer or clothing chain with questionable business practicies? 

edit: Here are the options I have discovered so far:

* [Pact](https://wearpact.com/men/underwear/knit%20boxers)

* [Boody](http://boodywear.com/product/boxers/)

* [Wool & Prince](https://woolandprince.com/collections/boxer-briefs/products/boxer-briefs) (I talked to them by email. The wool is non-mulesed from australia and the labor standards in South Korea where they are made is high. The nylon is from [here](http://www.nilit.com/fibers/products.asp).)

* [Bamboo Clothes](http://www.bambooclothes.com/category-s/1821.htm](http://www.bambooclothes.com/category-s/1821.htm) (not sure about the whole supply chain, although Bamboo seems to be an environmentally friendly material)

* [Rambler's Way](https://www.ramblersway.com/mens/merino-wool/mens-wool-boxer-briefs)

* [Rawganique](http://www.rawganique.com/Dept-Mens/RG808-hemp-linen-boxer-shorts-elastic-free.htm)

I bought the Boody boxers. They were both the cheapest and environmentally friendly, and also avoid any question of unethical treatment of animals, since they are made from bamboo.

edit: I also cross-posted this to /r/zerowaste and edited in some additional information there that I am copying over here in case anyone is looking:

edit 2: The boxers arrived from Boody. They are very comfortable and don't seem to get dirty or smell very easily so far. For the ZeroWaste folks, you should know that they arrive in a recycled cardboard box inside of a clear plastic bag that is not labeled as recyclable. They also come with a small glossy paper pamphlet with pictures of the different types of underwear they sell. According to the box, the fabric is 80% bamboo (Rayon made from bamboo), 13% Nylon, and 7% Spandex. I don't know about the Nylon, Spandex, or the plastic around the packaging, so I am contacting them to ask about them.

edit 3: according to the folks at Boody, the plastic bag is recyclable, and they ""engage with the Confidence in Textiles agency, EcoCert and the WRAP certification groups to ensure our raw materials are sourced from ethical companies, in addition to those paying livable wages, and abiding by environmental laws. We have visited our factories, and we are in constant contact with our managers to monitor our sources and switch suppliers if necessary."" So their suppliers for the spandex and nylon also meet ethical and environmental standards.

edit 4: After 3 years of weekly use and washings, the Boody underwear are near the end of their lifespan. They have developed holes and lost much of their elasticity, although they are still somewhat wearable. I don't have a good comparison point, but I hope this helps anyone who might find this post.","2017-02-14 01:15:33","9","13","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5tx20q/sustainable_undies/","True","jiggyjiggyjiggy","1747868856.402911","zero waste","manual"

I feel that there is a close connection between the two and believe that /r/zerowaste is a great community for exploring deeper into ways of reducing your waste and your footprint on the world. 

The sidebar description:
> The term **Zero Waste** means that we send **zero discards** to landfills or high-temperature incineration facilities. Instead, we promote the best practices of waste prevention, recycling, and composting.

>This community is for those who are interested in or currently living a zero or low-waste lifestyle. We are responsible consumers who buy in bulk, avoid disposables, carry reusable water bottles, and bring our own lunches.

It's a growing subreddit with an active community and plenty of insightful discussions and ideas. You should stop by and take a look!","2017-02-15 23:13:32","29","0","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/5ub1mn/one_way_of_living_more_sustainably_is_by_being/","True","ImLivingAmongYou","1747868912.3424718","zero waste","manual"
