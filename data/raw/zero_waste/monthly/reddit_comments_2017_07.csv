Set tickets at $5 for students and $10 for anyone else. Offer sustainable businesses space to promote at $100-200 a booth (at least at first, this could go up to $500 depending on your school).

It would be a lot of work, but 2k isn't really that much to work with. 2k is more like, ""what can we save up for and spend 4K on next year?""

Other than that, dorm room college kids aren't going to really care about sustainability unless it helps them. So make a prize pool of who can do X the best during the year/semester?","2017-07-19 19:39:14","7","BorisTheMagical","1747873321.3339698","zero waste","manual"
"dkfy4pw","t3_6o7zx8","6o7zx8","sustainability","action-oriented","So, two years ago I was part of a group on my college campus where we had $2000 to spend on something environmental related.  The project sprang from an Alternative Energy initiative I was part of; other components of the initiative included some student performed energy audits on some campus buildings, writing a grant to get a solar installation for a community center serving a low income part of town (which we got), presenting the mayor with a bike share program for the city (which was implemented), and petitioning the school to update its lighting to the latest tech (which was partially done), grant funds to power 
a small house on campus with solar (the Peters-Margadent House, if that means anything to anyone, its apparently architectural-historically valuable- we got the money) and a grant to purchase and distribute some LED bulbs to local residents (which we got and did).  That stuff isn't necessarily relevant to you, but it was done alongside the following.  

Additionally, we launched a week long green fair, of sorts, all with just that $2000.  In it, we had a table manned daily with general environmental info, local and national, and other stuff, t-shirts for signatories to a petition we had going (I think the bike share petition), green ribbons.  However, we also has this challenge to cut down energy use by 5% on campus during that week (first taking a control measurement of energy use the week prior), and made it something of a competition by monitoring the usage of different buildings.  We even got the school President to promise to give a speech in a polar bear outfit loaned to us by the Sierra Club if we succeeded.  

To that end, we purchased some energy use measurement tools for outlets, so students could borrow them and see the energy use of their different electronics and appliances.  We also got some pedal chargers for students to use to charge their electronics in the student union while pedaling, mostly as an awareness tool and to bring people to the table to try it out while we gave our spheel about conservation.  We also used some of that money to arrange for some local environmental leaders to come speak on campus that week- I think we had speakers 4 of the 7 days, ranging from sierra club reps to solar company ceo to some urban agriculture non-profit folks.  We also tossed around some ideas for dorm vegetable gardens and other things, but we ran out of time to plan it all.  

By the end of the week we had cut down on energy use by 9% on campus for that week, thanks to people cutting down on leaving lights on, mostly.  Pretty crazy, I think.  President gave his speech.  Here are some articles on it: https://www.evansville.edu/news/articleDetail.cfm?articleId=654

Anyway, point is, we did that with a similar budget and saw some real changes to campus.  Now, our campus was small, but we still put on a week long event, got some cool speakers, bought some tools that the group still uses today for awareness, blah blah blah, bragging that may not even be useful to you.  The other ideas here on this post are great, and things we would have targeted if we didn't already have them going on to some extent.  Hit me up if you want to run anything by me.

Those who volunteer time get to share in the weekly harvests when it starts producing.  Maybe if you all produce well enough then you could look at having volunteers take your excess to sell at the Farmer's Market (or invite the community to your campus) to make your money back and continue to grow the operation for new generations of students to contribute to.
