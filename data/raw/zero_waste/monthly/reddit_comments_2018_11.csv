Have a sense of humor about ourselves. A sub like this can easily get too pretentious.

Develope a checklist or step-ups plan for those new to the sub who want to make immediate changes but need to be real about making smaller moves to start (not sure if this already exists.

"e8vsnpv","t3_9tekd9","9tekd9","sustainability","action-oriented","I love the idea of being zero-waste, and my goal in life is to buy a farm and become fully self-sufficient. However, I have some issues with the zero-waste community after being subscribed there for a bit. My most glaring criticism is that often it seems like the community is solely focused on the visible waste that is produced, rather than all the externalities or waste or energy that is produced upstream from when they buy or use the product.

For example, buying a biodegradable computer case is great in theory, except that it took energy and raw materials and machinery to produce. The benefits of being biodegradable are completely outweighed by the inputs that it required to produce. I'm sure that that person had great intentions, I just can't handle that intellectual contradiction. I think the post that made me unsubscribe was about how to minimize waste plastic waste on flights, and it seemed that nobody wanted to face the fact that simply by stepping on an airplane they had thrown away years worth of being ""zero-waste"".  

Anyway, don't let my pessimism keep you down. Keep fighting the good fight. ","2018-11-02 00:10:52","16","sapractic","1747885217.80971","zero waste","manual"
"e8vs1zm","t3_9tekd9","9tekd9","sustainability","action-oriented","Thanks for posting just subscribed...

Is there a way to highlight stories about implementing solutions at a corporate or government level?

Sort of like, using less plastic bags personally is cool, but getting the restaurant you work at to switch to a bio plastic to go boxes is much more impactful. Sort of highlighting agency we have to impact at higher scale.

Interested to hear what you think about that

"e8w1ylz","t3_9tekd9","9tekd9","sustainability","action-oriented","[There are typically elections several times per year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL1luiOM7U)^§ but we don't always hear about them because they're very local. So, [voting is definitely a thing we need to get better at](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/sites/default/files/2017-impact-report.pdf), especially around midterms (otherwise [we will be ignored](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x)). ([Here's a climate/carbon pricing cheatsheet, for anyone interested](https://voteclimatepac.org/voters-guide/).) In the interim, [there are also lots of volunteer opportunities for growing the number of committed environmental voters](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/get-involved). 

We also need to [get better at lobbying](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf), just in general, but also, specifically around carbon taxes. 

The most recent IPCC report made clear that carbon pricing is not optional. It will require coordinated efforts to get us there. By my last estimate, we're about 24,000 active volunteers in key states away from getting significant carbon pricing passed through the U.S. Congress. For example, assuming Republicans hold control of the Senate, the states we will need the most help recruiting our volunteer lobbyists are Kentucky, Georgia, Kansas, Arkansas, Indiana, West Virginia, Texas, Missouri, and Nevada. Even people not in those states can do a lot to grow support for carbon pricing, including reaching out to businesses to seek endorsements, scheduling tabling or presentation events, hosting fundraisers to pay for local Meetup groups, writing op-eds or letters to the editor, etc. Anyway, there's free training for all this stuff from [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/), which is free to join. Anyone who cares about mitigating climate change should be a part of this group, imho. We should all also have a list of contacts in [Republican districts/states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index#By_congressional_district) that we can call when the bill comes to ask to call their Rep and Senators. I'm almost finished going through my Facebook contacts and already found 26 people with at least one Republican elected official who I'm nearly certain would call when the bill drops, and another 14 who either might have a Republican representing them or might make the call. If we all had a list like that, we could pass that bill today. 

TL;DR: It's difficult to think of anything more pressing than passing a strong carbon pricing bill, and to do that, we will need to vote and lobby.

"e8w2xtv","t3_9tekd9","9tekd9","sustainability","action-oriented","Maybe a monthly round-up thread about what political/community opportunities are coming up in your area? Something that prods people to quickly google to see if they can find something that's going to happen in their neck of the woods, and link it. Protests, groups that are doing volunteer drives, workshops, tree plantings, clean-up blitzes, campaigns to contact local politicians/companies, etc.

The goal of it wouldn't be to make a comprehensive directory, but the act of getting people to remember to look up what's happening might be a nudge to get people more involved. Even if they themselves can't participate in what they post, it might benefit lurkers who happen to be in the same area.","2018-11-02 02:43:28","4","robotsyrinx","1747885217.820512","zero waste","manual"
"e8wfie2","t3_9tekd9","9tekd9","sustainability","action-oriented","Avid lurker of ZeroWaste. Thank you for moderating the sub. I’m from Singapore, so I’m not familiar with the carbon emissions issue at other parts of the world. My country has also been stepping up on ZeroWaste efforts lately.

But what I really would like to see ZeroWaste doing is to also bring more focus to reduced consumption, first. While I really like the posts on repurposing and bulk buying, I’ve found many inapplicable to my urban high-pressure context where convenience is King. 

Personally I’d like to see more posts on how people used to live in the past before plastic and paper packaging was commonplace. Articles on how to pack and store perishables, debunking food hygiene paranoia etc would be very useful. Because it’s Reddit, right now it’s pretty much quote American-centric. But I’m pretty sure there are non-Nordic/Western/Asian Tigers countries that’s been living sustainably, with minimal consumption and waste.

Policy-makers tend to look at first-world ‘progressive’ countries for cues. Everyone could do with finding out how people from other - perhaps rural - parts of the world have been living, and the sub could have more posts on this.

I just want to let you know that while the intention to better the community is very well-appreciated, it’s really a combined effort and as a moderator, it’s really not entirely on you and your sub to affect a huge change. There are many subreddits covering different areas of environmental and consumption consciousness such as anticonsumption, permaculture, sewing etc. Best you can do is highly and frequently recommend visitors to also look into those subs to get a holistic idea. Maybe even collaborate with similar subs for even stronger alignment?

I think ZW is doing a good job, and I wish you all the best.","2018-11-02 07:27:55","5","laoniang","1747885217.824236","zero waste","manual"
"e8wafby","t3_9tekd9","9tekd9","sustainability","action-oriented","The community should stop pushing vegan/vegetarian agenda. It's not for everyone and the constant unwanted and unsolicited proselytizing with little respect to one's circumstance, culture, family tradition and medical conditions is not just disrespectful, but toxic. It sends a message of exclusivity as well as the idea of unattainable and misguided perfectionism and I think it's important to remember that big changes happen from many individuals making small changes. We should encourage that. 

Perhaps the community could focus on how we can organize to help politicians whose environmental values align with ours so that they can be elected and create policies that help  the environment. 

What about educational outreach on our consumption, packing and waste culture and start urging schools to include climate change, the 5 R's and what children can do to help because I'm a firm believer that changes at home start with children. If we want to drive change, it needs to start with educating our young ones.

It’s good to see your subreddit has 80k subscribers, but this subreddit needs that and more for faster progress towards sustainability. 

Emphasize on “ reduce” having higher order of magnitude impact than “reuse and recycle” in your discussions. Also, raising  the red flag on Jevons paradox in your subreddit discussions whenever appropriate would be useful for people to realize  the net reduction in overall footprint instead of reduction in footprint in one category ( We had a recent post on this if you want to cross post).
