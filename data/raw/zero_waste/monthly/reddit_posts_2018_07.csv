"90qc9i","sustainability","action-oriented","Searching for a particular article with a comparison chart for the Cape Town water crisis..","I came across an article a few days ago (Wednesday or Thursday) about the Cape Town water crisis and their limits. It had a nice graphic comparing the 13.9gal limit to the usage of the average US household on a daily basis, but of course am finding it impossible to find now. It was also a well written article that seemed credible, so it'd be nice to review those details, too. For my sake of sharing with friends and family, the graphic is important so I'm on the hunt for this article exactly - but I forget where it came from. If it's helpful at all, the graphic had a blue color scheme to it..

I believe I found the article through here or through another sustainability/environmental/zero waste blog, but it's within the community - and I really want a lot of people (esp Americans) to see it to get thinking about this issue more.

I just Handwashed some dishes (dishwasher is running and the kitchen is a disaster) with splashes of water after minimally filling up my sink basin. At the end of it all I still managed to accumulate about 3gal of water, which is a lot when you put it against a 14gal limit for the day.. I'm in the states, so no limits here (yet...) although, I try to do what I can to keep water usage low. Planning to get a rain barrel to at least do my plants here soon :) Hoping to implement some methods and devices around the house soon to keep water usage as minimal as possible!","2018-07-21 16:05:55","7","2","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/90qc9i/searching_for_a_particular_article_with_a/","True","MaryDesiree86","1747882472.721164","zero waste","manual"
