"d8ve51","climate","scientific","The One Choice You Make 3x a Day, Everyday of the Year.","Please consider your diet. Everything typically shared here are phenomenal ways to save, please keep outwardly expressing them to those around you. In person.  
But not one of these decisions (save for minimizing the mouths in this world) are made more frequently than what you put on your plate. \~3x a day, 365.24 days a year.  
Maybe because it's the most habitual routine we have, it is tough to break. But the American diet has been detrimental to the globe. A MEAL DOES NOT NEED MEAT TO BE A MEAL. The opposite ideology started in the industrial boom, increased meat consumption as living standards rose, and historically plant-based countries (China, and India) followed our lead. Soon they surpassed us--in both population boom and automated food production to match.  
START TO RETHINK YOUR PLATE. The inefficiency of meat production impacts our global sustainability, energy, water use, water pollution, land use, emissions, transportation (temp controlled), packaging/waste, and government subsidy allocation.
