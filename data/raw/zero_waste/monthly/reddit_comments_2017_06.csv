"disj32w","t3_6god03","6god03","collapse","skeptical",">where the ONLY country in Africa that doesn't have official independence is Rhodesia. It was the last hold of the British Empire, at least outwardly in name. The British quickly realized this didn't look good, so they granted it ""independence"" (while still having heavy control behind the scenes) with the stipulation it be called Zimbabwe.

Bullshit - Rhodesia was the first country to unilaterally declare independence from Britain since the USA.

>Britain, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.
