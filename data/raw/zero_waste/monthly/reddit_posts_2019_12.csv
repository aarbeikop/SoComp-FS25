• I recycle and compost

• I travel by public transport (I don't have a car)

• I always bring my own bags to the supermarket 

• I donate to green initiatives

• I vote for political parties that consider the climate emergency

• I use eco friendly, fragrance free washing up liquid and laundry detergent 

• I visit a zero waste shop to refill the above products

• I use reusable make up removal pads, sanitary wear, bamboo toothbrush etc 

• I am a strict vegetarian 

• I go litter picking 

• I pay to offset my carbon emissions each time I fly (not a frequent flyer)

• I avoid palm oil

• I frequently buy second hand clothing (90% of my wardrobe is eBay/depop)

• I am savvy with my water and energy usage within my home 

• I (gently) educate my family on environmental issues, as they are less clued up on Earth's impending doom!
