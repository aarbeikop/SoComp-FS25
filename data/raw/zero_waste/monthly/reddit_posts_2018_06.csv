"8q16qx","environment","emotional","A few tips to cut down on our waste and save the marine life","Sometimes, do not see doesn’t equal to do not exist. Nowadays, the production of plastic-related things has already severely polluted the ocean and significantly influenced the marine life. How can we better perfect the environment? Here’re some tips to cut down on our waste, according to FuninUSA news.

1. Zero waste shopping
Instead of those flimsy plastic produce bags, pick up a set of reusable mesh produce bags for your fruits and veggies. Also, check with your market on their policy and procedures to see if they can allow you to bring your own containers or bulk bins to fill up products such as flour, nuts, rice. Whole Foods, Sprouts, WinCo, Publix, your local co-op and even many Safeway/Vons supermarkets all have bulk bins.

2. No more plastic water bottles
A reusable bottle is perfect for you. Glass bottles, double-wall insulated stainless steel bottles, and BPA-free plastic bottles are all good choices. Whichever you choose, fill it and take it with you when you leave the house so you don't have a reason to buy a disposable bottle. 

3. Ditch the plastic straws
Politely refuse or not take a straw when you get a beverage. If you really want to sip your drink from a straw, try a reusable one, such as glass straws or metal straws. All of them come with a cleaning brush so they are easy to keep clean.

4. Cloth > paper
Paper towels are convenient for cleaning up a spill, but they're wasteful and expensive in the long run. Pick up some reusable cleaning cloths instead. Bar mop towels, microfiber towels, and linen and cotton Unpaper Towels are all deserved your love.

5. Bring your own cutlery 
The best way to resist plastic forks, knives and spoons when you eat out, order delivery, and in your office's break room is to bring your own cutlery with you. Recommend titanium spork, which does double duty for soups, salads, yogurt and more. Or you can try full bamboo set with a fork, knife and spoon.

Aside from the tips above, one good way can also be eat more vegetables instead of meat because the livestock industry pollution is also severe and negatively impacts the entire environment, undermining the principle of sustainable development.","2018-06-10 14:37:29","7","2","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/8q16qx/a_few_tips_to_cut_down_on_our_waste_and_save_the/","True","FuninUSA","1747881162.778549","zero waste","manual"

absolute power and a soveriegn nation cannot exist at the same time in the state of a nations governmental  system

the corrupt COUNCIL of duplicitous agents, wolves in sheeps clothing, the moneychangers in the church parading around in a white gown and top hat, holding a scepter of office and wearing a golden gem encrusted crown and telling thee that ""this is for the best interests of our people.""

""poisoning our own people from corporate industry""

""making of and engaging in war will help to HEAL the blasted apart bodies of our people, put handfuls of intestines back in their stomaches, and place their broken skull cap back on their thinking heads""

freemen are NEVER truly free as long as they hath of a hangman's noose around their neck

you are not a free man unless ye hath of liberty

you are not a free man unless ye can protect of THY OWN PEOPLE

you are not a free man unless ye can prevent of Mass Extinction

and freemen, hath not of freedom NOR liberty if they cannot prevent corporations from'st of toxic waste and'n pollution to'st a ""zero tolerance"" policy, as a rich man dost so to the commonfolk when'st of other subject and category, only when it benefits the rich man and the'st poor commonfolk are made to'n suffer so, their health now wanning.

Coal Ash Is More Radioactive Than Nuclear Waste - Scientific American

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/

Increased solar radiation will boil oceans

https://climatenewsnetwork.net/emissions-could-make-earth-uninhabitable/

Note: More lethal space radiation is hitting earth, and more will do so soon because of 2 reasons; 1) weakening magnetic field, 2) ozone destruction due to increased volcanic and human activity.

This increased space radiation separates the increased water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, since hydrogen is the lightest element, it drifts off into space, and without hydrogen there's no water.

Water vapor itself has become a climate feedback loop. Increased upper atmospheric water vapor and radiation can accelerate planetary ocean loss.

Vaclav Smil says energy transitions take at least 70 years, if ever, to happen.

When people got sick of coal power and smoggy cars, the government promised that hydro power would replace coal, which it did NOT, instead it just added to the power use, so coal kept growing right along with hydro. This is exactly what is happening with renewable power and fossil fuels now.

We transitioned from wood to coal a few hundred years ago, and many still burn wood to this day, because dead wood is free in the jungle.

We got 20 years to get emissions BELOW ZERO for eternity, or hit 2 C.

To do that we have to first reduce emissions 100% in 20 years.

It takes 50 years to change world energy demand 100% worldwide.

That's because worldwide means like all over the whole fucking world.

The plant waste we burn is food for the soil and trees, not green energy for us to steal.

We are changing earth 100X faster than whatever killed the dinosaurs.

We are going to run out of food and water before we get 50% renewable energy worldwide.

Each fracking well uses 2-9 million gallons of fresh water. It's not facking that causes earthquakes as much as it's pumping frack waste water back underground.

By 2025, 50% of people will not have enough year round water.

Try going without water for a few months.

By 2030, world water demand will exceed supplies by 40%.

When you eat avocado and toast and drink a fancy ass coffee, you're really drinking 100 cups of imported water. That water likely came from the ground somewhere else in the world. While we can figure out how to grow them here, it's cheaper to just suck the world dry.

Argentina, major crop hub, is in a super nasty drought now.

Australia's been in drought about as long as California.

The east club med countries are in a 900 year drought.

India is in the most intense drought in all its history.

When you look at a world water supply map on wiki, you'll see lots of blue and think it doesn't look so bad, but you'd be wrong.

"8s7u6y","collapse","skeptical","The Political Drivers of Collapse","Draw a line, put a dot in the middle, that dot is collapse.

Imagine the right side of the line is populism, imagine lighting it like a fuse and watching it burn towards the middle.

The left side of the line is fake liberalism and is made of ideals like food waste recovery and veganism. Idealistic hegemony is the spark that lights the fuse from the left side of collapse.

This political divide is primary driver of collapse. 

Rednecks and hippies are actually working together to prevent rational choice, this divide is aided and abetted by politicians and media.

We don't have time for endless empty moral victories.

Ask any feminist or communist if their 100-year battles are finished, and you'll see what I mean.

People don't care about collapse, they care about impractical moral victories.

While we're idealistically violent, we only really care about money and love.

We can't do anything about ideals and love, the only thing we can fix is money.

Money scares and lusts us so bad we can't think straight about it.

That's how banksters privatized the nation state's currency and credit over 100 years ago.

The only way to stop imperial fascism is tax carbon and give it 100% back to private citizens.

Do not allow traitors like Bernie Sanders let government take 40% of that money like he wants.

Corporations and governments MUST get ZERO% of carbon dividends, or it will fail being fit for purpose.

You cannot win a war without money. 

War = Money

Money can unite us, if it's 100% ours and becomes fit for purpose.

Then people can vote on education and healthcare instead of war as we phase out the imperial deep state.
