In my school days, social studies comprised of general weathers, different parts of the world, different species existing, wildlife, birds, and forest etc which upgraded in to civics and geography in later stages. But today’s generation is reading all about global warming, urbanization, deforestation, extinction of birds and animals, pollution etc. Sometimes I feel that although being updated and aware of the situation is a good thing, but the reality of the future is scary. We are showing them a place that will be full of buildings but no trees, lots of people but no birds and animals (think about the zoo. No animals present, only their posters stating that Tiger use to look like this, elephant use to look like this), plastic bottles for water but no river, lakes or ponds, no oxygen in the air but only carbon emissions and harmful gases to breathe. Sad!! Isn’t it?
Don’t say yes. Because we are the ones, who are and will be responsible for these grave scenarios in future. All over the internet, social media and in person, environmentalists and people are trying to hold seminars, peace walks, panels etc to make people aware of the atrocities being put on the environment and the aftermaths we are supposed to face as a result. What we are failing to see is that we are actually slowly murdering the nature. Many countries have taken steps to recover the lost glory for their existence but I guess we Indians are waiting for a miracle to happen. Am I right? Get up and start doing things at the ground level. Then only it will make any difference to the bigger things happening around. Recycling is the best initiative one can think of at personal level. This is one thing at ground level work you can start doing today onwards. Recycling is all about putting the discarded things into some other use. Basically, it’s an art to prevent it to go in the environment in the form of carbon and harmful gases. Try using the things which are easily recyclable. So let’s discuss about top 5 things that can be recycled at home and how?
1.	Glass Bottles: First thing that came into my mind to replace is plastic bottles we use for storing water at home. First and foremost, we should discard all the plastic bottles. Instead, we should use glass bottles for all the storage purposes at home. Be it for water, staples, miscellaneous purposes, use glass bottles. Not only a large gallon of water is wasted in making plastic bottles, but lots of greenhouse gases are also emitted in the atmosphere, which is sheer waste and harmful. On the other hand, glass can be recycled many number of times with less wastage and destruction. It is also interesting to know that recycling glass containers of any type is generally about 33% more efficient than producing them from scratch. This saves lots of energy consumption which reduces carbon emissions. Thus, switch to glass bottles in your home for all purposes and décor. Also, stop using aerated drinks in a plastic bottle. Help the government in improving the economy by having local homemade drinks instead of these aerated ones in the market. Not only it will boost the economy and local produce but will also reduce the plastic consumption.
2.	Storage Bags and Containers: Use cloth bags or jute bags or handmade paper bags instead of these plastic ones. You can actually make bags out of t-shirts, shirts and other home material through many DIY videos online. This will not only replace plastic bags but will also recycle your old clothes. Just remember or read, the number of deaths of the water mammals or of street dogs, cats and cows, who eat these plastic bags. It will come to a stop if we will alter our mode of usage. Try to join hands with companies which are following zero plastic usage policies and also create awareness.
3.	Clothes: Try to donate old clothes to some NGO’s or child care centers registered under the government. They can be well distributed and utilized among the needy ones. You can be of some help to the people who are daily trying hard for their existence, instead of trying to find ways to adjust them in your almirahs. 
4.	Compost: This is one of the best methods I came across recently to manage the waste produced at home. Make a compost bin in your home and put all the waste materials like peel offs, seeds, pet hair, shells etc into that instead of putting it in the dustbin. Use this organic waste into nutrient rich soil for your plants and the garden. It reduces and eliminates the need of chemical fertilizers, water and pesticides. It removes solids, oil, grease, and heavy metals from storm water runoff. To know more about composting, read the related articles online or on our blog. It very well reuse and recycle the waste into a healthy, nutrient rich soil for your home.
5.	Paper and cardboards: Go digital. It is a very well known fact now that every ton of paper recycled saves 7 trees, 9,000 pond of steam, 60,000 gallons of water, 350 pounds of limestone and 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space. Importantly, if all the newspapers were recycled, we could save 250 million trees each year. Donate all the cardboards and hard board stuff to NGOs or to small scale industries. They utilize those in their daily work very diligently and efficiently. 
If this was not enough to encourage you to recycle then read this information. I am sure this will ring a bell.
“Recycling creates 4 jobs for every 1 job in the waste management and disposal industries.”

"6god03","collapse","skeptical","The Rothschilds own Zimbabwe and Botswana","Zimbabwe is a land-locked country just across the northeast border of South Africa. It was chartered in 1889 by the Queen of England and the land was given to the ""British South Africa Company"" (BSAC), and it was all funded by the Rothschilds. Before it was called Zimbabwe, it was called Rhodesia, after Cecil Rhodes. Here's a map:

* http://www.rhodesia.me.uk/images/RhodesiaLocationMap_final2LoRes.jpg

Cecil Rhodes (of the Rhodes Scholar program, where Bill Clinton later studied) was given control of the BSAC, and this was all financially backed by Baron Nathan de Rothschild who was also financially backing the Queen (through the N M Rothschild & Sons bank, a bank founded by his grandpa):
 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_South_Africa_Company#Board_divisions 

According to historian Niall Ferguson, ""For most of the nineteenth century, N M Rothschild was part of the biggest bank in the world which dominated the international bond market. For a contemporary equivalent, one has to imagine a merger between Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, J P Morgan and probably Goldman Sachs too—as well, perhaps, as the International Monetary Fund, given the nineteenth-century Rothschild's role in stabilising the finances of numerous governments.""

The Rothschilds, through their company N M Rothschild & Sons, have overseen the finances of British Royalty for quite some time now. This goes right up our modern era. From the wiki page of N M Rothschild & Sons: ""Chairman Sir Evelyn Rothschild is currently the personal financial advisor of Queen Elizabeth II, and she knighted him in 1989 for his services to banking and finance.""

*  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_M_Rothschild_%26_Sons

To make overall situation more clear, here is the Rothschild family tree. We are looking at the London branch. Nathan (1777-1836) was the founder of the London bank, and his grandchild (on the left) Baron Nathanial (1840-1915) is the one who funded the BSAC that conquered Rhodesia. And Evelyn (1931- ) is the one who was knighted 28 years ago and is _the_ (singular) financial advisor to the Queen, according to the wiki article above.

After Queen Victoria issued the charter for Rhodesia in 1889 in cooperation with Cecil Rhodes with the Rothchild's backing, the BSAC troops marched up from South Africa in 1890, just one year later. They weren't wasting any time. 

The BSAC troops (or ""police"" in the language of the BSAC) overthrew the existing regional governments in the location of Rhodesia at the time, called the ""South African Republic"" or ""Transvaal"" prior to becoming Rhodesia. The original 100 BSAC ""pioneers"" who led the very first expeditions in 1890 were each promised 3,000 acres of land and 15 mining claims as a reward for their service. Essentially they were mercenaries, paid by the BSAC, which was financially owned by the Rothschilds. 

By 1896, the local Zimbabwean population was getting upset with the growing numbers of BSAC entering their country and taking resources by force. By this time there were over 4,000 BSAC mercenaries in Zimbabwe. As a result of the tensions, a battle broke out with the BSAC in what is now retroactively called ""The First war of Zimbabwean Independence"" but is also known as the ""First Chimurenga"" or the ""Second Matabele War"". Approximately 400 BSAC were killed in this battle, but over 50,000 natives died. That's not a typo. That's a 125:1 ratio. That's not a fight, that's a slaughter. 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Matabele_War

It was almost certainly due to the British's superior technology. Namely: The Maxim Gun. It was the first fully automatic machine gun, invented in 1883 and consequently used by the British to take over much of Africa. The common saying among the British at the time was ""Whatever happens, we have got \ The Maxim gun, and they have not."" 

After killing the fifty thousand, the BSAC then ruled Rhodesia until 1922, when the BSAC turned it over to the British Crown.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_Rhodesia

Moving forward, look at this territorial map of Zimbabwe in 1965, which demonstrates how much territory the British had conquered within the country. They controlled all this land, in addition to controlling the government, despite still being a tiny minority of the population who had just appeared 70 years prior. 

* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Rhodesialand.png/300px-Rhodesialand.png 

The Second War of Zimbabwean Independence happened from 1964-1979 and was a bloody civil war mixed in with a rebellion against the foreign ownership of the country. This lasted until the country gained independence in 1980. The guerrilla warfare, partially led by Robert Mugabe, killed 1,361 ""Rhodesian Security Forces"" (read: British/Rothschild Troops) and also resulted in the deaths of another 10,000 local Zimbabwean guerrilla fighters. 

Here is an animated historical political map of Africa, starting in the late 1860s, showing the peak of the ""Scramble for Africa"", which went from 1881 to 1914. You can see the British Empire in red at the bottom: 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzKejJIwieE&t=5m50s

Also take special notice at the timestamp 6:17 (showing 1979) where the ONLY country in Africa that doesn't have official independence is Rhodesia. It was the last hold of the British Empire, at least outwardly in name. The British quickly realized this didn't look good, so they granted it ""independence"" (while still having heavy control behind the scenes) with the stipulation it be called Zimbabwe. 

So as we showed earlier when the British Empire controls something, essentially means that we know the Rothschilds basically have control over it as well since they control the purse-strings. So we can reasonably conclude the Rothschilds had control of Zimbabwe until at _least_ 1979, and probably after that as well, as England voluntarily gave Zimbabwe independence in  a sudden surprise move, which indicates that they weren't actually losing that much power by doing so, but it clearly improved the optics of the situation in the eyes of the public. 

Since independence in 1980, Zimbabwe has had exactly 1 president, and his name is Robert Mugabe. Maybe you've heard of him, he's 93 years old now. He's a self-declared ""Catholic Marxist"" who wants the minority whites out of the Zimbabwean government and fought with the guerrillas in the Second War of Zimbabwean Independence. Here's his picture: 

* http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2016/02/19/zimbabwe-president-robert-mugabe-attends-independence-rally-harare..jpg

The 1979 Lancaster House Agreement that outlined the transition to Zimbabwean independence also ""ensured that the country's white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in the new Parliament"", and heavy ties to the debt structure of the new country. 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#Lancaster_House_Agreement:_1979

However Zimbabwe currently has 90-95% unemployment at the moment because of the collapse in value of the Zimbabwean dollar due to hyperinflation from 2004-2009. The central bank was printing $100 Trillion banknote denominations, and had to ""redenominate"" their currency by arbitrarily removing zeros in the hopes of resetting it to something not-ridiculous. They did this 3 times, in 2006, 2008 and 2009. 

Printing money and creating hyperinflation is typically a strategy to resolve debt, because if the debt is a 100 trillion dollars, you can just print 100 quadrillion dollars and then the debt is nothing, but it screws the economy up very badly because everyone's savings become worth nothing so everyone is poor and no businesses can keep running. It's the ultimate reset switch, and it often comes with a heavy price, like 95% unemployment and an almost completely collapsed economy. 

In some nations, the governments rule the central banks. In most nations, the central banks rule the governments. So that means this inflation is typically done by the central bank, not the government, because the central bank control the lending rate (interest charged to the government for new money creation). 

The founder of N M Rothschild & Sons said it best himself - ""I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain's money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply"": 

* http://www.australiannationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-shot-2014-12-08-at-12.01.50-PM.png

Over in the US, Thomas Jefferson understood it as well - ""I believe that banking  institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered."":

So now that we see the Rothschilds very likely own Zimbabwe, let's shift gears and talk about the country next door: Botswana. Just to the west of Zimbabwe right across the border, just north of South Africa, is the country Botswana where the company of De Beers has maintained operations for 130 years. Cecil Rhodes and Nathan de Rothschild started De Beers in 1888, just one year before they created the BSAC in 1889. They were busy guys. 

De Beers' primary location of operations is Botswana, through a company called Debswana, which is now a 50-50 joint venture with the government. The largest export in the country is diamonds, the economy heavily relies on diamonds, and thus on De Beers, and thus on the Rotshchilds. 

* https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Tree_map_export_2009_Botswana.jpeg

De Beers has been shown to at one point own approximately 90% of the world's diamonds, and the amount they release out of supply that year essentially determines the price of diamonds. The Rothschilds control the price of the entire diamond market. Diamonds are only artificially rare because of De Beers. One might even say the culture of buying diamonds for wedding engagements, which only came about in the 1940s, was a result of the De Beers too, as it was their advertisements through De Beers that created this cultural standard, using the media.  All to create more demand for their artificially limited product. This funny video from ""Adam Ruins Everything"" documents  it well:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5kWu1ifBGU

In fact the collusion is so obvious they've gotten caught multiple times, even recently. For example in 1994 they got caught colluding with General Electric to fix the price of industrial diamonds, and paid a paltry $10M fine to the US Dept. of Justice in 2004 (more like the government wants their cut, because I doubt it actually stopped anything): 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers#Industrial_diamonds

Former CIA chief Admiral Stansfield Turner even claimed that De Beers restricted US access to industrial diamonds needed for the country's war effort during World War II.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers#Oppenheimer_control

So by controlling the economy of Botswana, De Beers and thus the Rothschilds control a big chunk of the country. In a similar manner to Exxon's ownership of Chad, which I covered in a previous article that you can read here:
 
* https://www.reddit.com/r/magnora7/comments/6aaabs/exxon_owns_the_country_of_chad/

That article discussed petro-imperialism in Chad. De Beers practiced diamond-imperialism (blood diamonds) in Botswana. And then the story of Zimbabwe is a yet another different type of imperialism, endorsed by the Royal Crown, but in this case carried out by a hired private corporation (the BSAC) instead of the National Army as one might expect in a traditional imperialism scenario, and funded by a billionaire family. 

With the top-down ownership of these three countries understood in proper context, one must wonder: How many other countries in the world are owned by corporations or billionaires? How subtle can the mechanism of ownership be, while still remaining pervasive enough to own everyone? Going by what history shows us, it usually comes down to ownership of the money, and ownership of the means by which new money is created. Which means owning the central bank, and owning the means of production. 

You've heard of company towns, where the company runs and owns everything? Well these are company countries. And now we've seen 3 examples, out of the 196 countries in the world. How many more are there?
