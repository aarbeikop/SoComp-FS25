"c6fhq4","sustainability","action-oriented","An idea I had in the shower, why isn’t it already a thing?","So I’ve only recently been trying to go green, and I’ve been considering bamboo tooth brushes and bars of shampoo instead of bottles. I thought about whether there was a way I could use a more environmentally friendly washing liquid. I realised that most powders come in boxes but liquids don’t. However I don’t really like powders (I share a laundry with people who use them and there’s always powder left in the machine). I thought “why can’t we just have dispensers for things at the stores, and they calculate how much you fill up your container as it fills and you could use that for all liquids and even cookies and lollies and potato chips can use them. And that way it’s got zero packaging instead of just better packaging. It would also reduce waste, with people only getting as much as they need, rather than getting more than they can use and throwing out the rest. Why hasn’t this been implemented in stores already? Do you know of anyone who could start working on it? I don’t really know where to start with an idea like this. Also I wanna know if any of you can see potential problems with the system. 
Thanks.","2019-06-28 04:06:53","75","34","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/c6fhq4/an_idea_i_had_in_the_shower_why_isnt_it_already_a/","True","Smylist","1747890563.5567539","zero waste","manual"
"bwfqa4","sustainability","action-oriented","Circular Economy for Dummies","What is circular economy?
A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which we keep resources in use for as long as possible, extract the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each service life.

Examples of circular economy:
In March, Timberland paired up with textile company Thread International to launch a new line of shoes, backpacks and shirts made from 50 percent recycled plastic, sourced from Haiti. Not only has this initiative removed over 700,000 plastic bottles from Haiti’s streets, it has created jobs in one of the world’s poorest countries. Timberland and Thread International even partnered with local recycling centers that encouraged more than 1,300 Haitians to collect bottles for profit. 
HP recovers plastic from used ink cartridges and toners via the Planet Partners program and recycles it to produce new ink cartridges. Through the program, an internet-connected printer notifies HP when it is running low on ink. The customer is automatically delivered a replacement cartridge and a postage-paid envelope for returning used cartridges. This saves customers time, hassle and money — up to 50 percent on ink — while being gentler on the planet.
Alaska Airlines converts its unwanted airline seats to handbags and purses

Some of the examples above again emphasise the importance of collaboration in developing sustainable operating practices, organisations could utilise networks such as reddit, [Linkedin](linkedin.com), or physical networking events. However, new online platforms are also appearing such as [Susatainability Connected](sustainabilityconnected.com)  which aim to globally connect organisations of similar interests, 

Why is it important? 
The main reason for utilising a more circular economy as opposed to a linear one is as a planet, we are now producing nearly 300 million tons of plastic every year, half of which is for single use. Our finite resources are diminishing and, at the same time, as the global population grows, we are requiring more resources than ever before.
As well as creating new opportunities for growth, a more circular economy will:
reduce waste
drive greater resource productivity 
deliver a more competitive UK economy.
position the UK to better address emerging resource security/scarcity issues in the future. 
help reduce the environmental impacts of our production and consumption in both the UK and abroad.

How can an organisation do this? 
This is a big question for an organisation to answer, it is particularly difficult considering the fundamental concept of circular economy is one of connectivity, so to do this alone as an organisation is challenging. However, we like challenges, so here we go; 

The [Ellen MacArthur Foundation](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org) recommends that to transition from the current trajectory to a circular one, European economies and companies must undertake six actions under the ReSOLVE framework: 

Regenerate - Shift to renewable energy and materials; reclaim, retain, and regenerate health of ecosystems and return recovered biological resources to the biosphere. Cumulative new investments in European renewable energy represented USD 650 billion over the 2004–13 period.3 The Savory Institute has influenced the regeneration of more than 2.5 million hectares of land worldwide

Share - Keep product loop speed low and maximise utilisation of products, by sharing them among different users (peer-to-peer sharing of privately owned products or public sharing of a pool of products), by reusing them through their entire technical lifetime (second hand), and by prolonging their lifetime through maintenance, repair, and design for durability. BlaBlaCar is one famous car example growing at 200% per annum with 20 million registered users in 19 countries. BMW and Sixt’s DriveNow offer by-the-minute rental of cars that can be collected and dropped anywhere in a city centre. Lyft matches passengers needing a lift with drivers of their own cars willing to provide one through a smartphone app. In housing, Airbnb has more than one million spaces listed in more than 34,000 cities across more than 190 countries.

Optimize -  Increase performance/efficiency of a product; remove waste in production and supply chain (from sourcing and logistics, to production, use phase, end-of-use collection etc.); leverage big data, automation, remote sensing and steering. All these actions are implemented without changes to the actual product or technology. A wellknown illustration of this lever is the lean philosophy made famous by Toyota.

Loop -  Keep components and materials in closed loops and prioritise inner loops. For finite materials, it means remanufacturing products or components and recycling materials. Caterpillar, Michelin, Rolls Royce, Philips or Renault are just a few companies exploring this direction. For renewable materials, it means anaerobic digestion and extracting biochemicals from organic waste. The Plant is an example of closed loop, zero-waste food production located in Chicago. 

Virtualize - Dematerialise resource use by delivering utility virtually: directly, e.g. books or music; or indirectly, e.g. online shopping, autonomous vehicles, virtual offices. Google, Apple, and most OEMs plan to release driverless cars on the market in the next decade. 

Exchange - e. Replace old with advanced non-renewable materials, apply new technologies (e.g. 3D printing or electric engines) and choose new products/services (e.g. multimodal transport). For instance, in 2014 Chinese company WinSun 3D-printed ten houses, each about 195 square metres, in 24 hours. 

In-house circularity 
This is the idea being that an organisation closes cycles that almost entirely occur within the scope of the organisation. The organisation may do so alone or with the help of suppliers. A typical example is that of the horticulturalist that keeps heat, water and chemicals within their own company. Closing these ‘in-house’ cycles has only limited effect on the revenue model of an organisation but generates a reduction of costs and can act as a start for developing a circular economy model. An example of this being turning scrap tree logs into decorative features which would be categorised as “Loop” from the ReSOLVE framework.

Organisations should consider utilising process mapping to look across operations and supply chain; are there opportunities to reuse, refurbish, recycle, repurpose etc. to rethink the business model in a circular way?

Having mapped their products or services operations and supply chain, they can conduct an assessment against the ReSOLVE framework to categorise options to becoming more circular. In order to begin the transformation, organisations should consider the following in which ReSOLVE can be applied:

Recovering materials from end-of-life products for use as raw materials in another process, excluding incineration to generate energy. May lead to materials of the same quality, lower quality (down-cycling) or higher quality (upcycling). For organic matter, may refer to composting or anaerobic digestion

Disassembling products at the component level rather than into separate materials, replacing broken or out-dated parts to make a new product for sale or lease. This avoids a new product having to be manufactured

 Selling or donating a product in its original form, or with little change, which avoids a new product having to be manufactured. May also include redistribution of unwanted food.

Extending the life of a product with its first owner, either via a repair or refurbishment service, or by making it easier for users to repair it themselves. This delays the purchase of a replacement product.

Developing products that use fewer materials or have a smaller environmental footprint, that are designed to be more durable, or to be offered as a service through a leasing or take-back model. Also includes adaptations to make products easier to maintain, reuse, remanufacture or disassemble and recycle at end-of-life. Aims to tackle the most material impacts, based on lifecycle analysis.","2019-06-03 20:41:02","13","2","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/bwfqa4/circular_economy_for_dummies/","True","AdamRae123","1747890691.331923","zero waste","manual"
