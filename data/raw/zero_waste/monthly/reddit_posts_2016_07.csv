The war could have ended with a victory of Germany, whose only real colony was in what is now Tanzania. But a few 'heroic' actions by the Entente kept the war going for 4 years.

Long story short, the Entente had to use the resources of the colonies to fight Germany, which created a large number of colonials with military experience, and had to give concessions to the local elites whose demands for independence grew stronger after World War 2.

So, instead of the resources being used to further Western Civilization and technical advances, they were used to support the array of newly independent countries, many of them turned into failed states almost immediately.

And, instead of giving up the third world and let the Soviets worry about them, America and the West wasted a lot of resources to prop up it and also sold fertilizers , etc to there, creating a huge overpopulation problem which will only have dire consequences in the very near future.

A quick end of the Great War would have meant that instead of 7.5 billion people trying to live like Americans, we would at most have 1 billion people living a more advanced life with slightly higher ecological footprint, and about 1 billion people still living like primitives, with virtually zero ecological footprint, with virtually no hope of bettering themselves and stuck at where they are. (there were 1.2 billion people in the 'third world' on 1914 but I would imagine that being denied of most 'goodies' of the modern world and with good lands going to the arrivals from the advanced world, their numbers would have declined somewhat.)

Because Eleanor Roosevelt was hoodwinked by Chiang Kaishek's wife, America balked Japan annexing Manchuria and parts of China, which led to Pearl harbor, Hiroshima and the reunification of China by Mao. It would have been better for America to let Japan rule part of China and deal with the communists, instead of creating a super-China with 100 million consumers living Western-style lifestyle (and consumption level) and 1.2 billion would-be consumers who would want to live like that, and which led China to waste lots of resources to build 'ghost cities', per example.

Tl, dr: Because the Great War lasted too long, it became inevitable that the colonials would have greater voice, and it led to a situation where, instead of 1 billion people spending the resources and the other billion denied of most modern goods, we have 7.5 billion depleting the world's resources, hastening collapse threefold.","2016-07-04 05:39:47","2","15","0.55","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/4r5rwv/would_it_have_been_better_if_the_third_world_were/","True","kulmthestatusquo","1747856993.7320452","zero waste","manual"
