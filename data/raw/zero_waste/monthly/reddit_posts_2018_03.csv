You cannot have it because we are collapsing.

Trump/Clinton are mere names.

Our greed and guilt are collective.

You want to save earth and swipe on Tinder.

Both of these things can't be done.

Energy executives are crying because we don't want pipelines.

We actually want natural gas every single day.

We just don't want it to kill us.

We cannot have it all.

You have to give things up, or you won't have anything anymore.

This is a total zero sum game.

There is no happy break even point.

We spent 200 years getting our emission this high.

Now we have 20 years to get them down to zero.

We are not going to do this because it can't be done.

Prepare for the worst, because the worst is coming.

Don't pretend we can fix this without giving up things we want.

What's more important, your child's life or your phone?

"87b8b7","sustainability","action-oriented","Replacing the zero waste/resuables movement with compostables?","What if instead of pushing for everyone to use resuables like cloths and metal straws, we work towards a set up where everything is completely compostable? Materials science will be the priority. Packaging will still exist, but they're made from plant-based materials that are not too energy-intensive to produce. The plantations for these plant sources will be maintained from the composted packaging materials + all the usual composted stuff, creating a closed loop.

That way, we'll still have the convenience of plastics and disposables. We  won't accidentally destroy for forests mining for metals with the increased demand for metal straws. We won't use up more water having to wash all our reusables. We won't end up with cloth and metal items that will cause more damage when they eventually have to be thrown away.

Thoughts? Is this already happening or.being discussed somewhere? Sorry for my ignorance if it is haha

EDIT: Sorry, i don't mean EVERYTHING should be compostable. We should definitely still have reusables, but perhaps to a minimum.","2018-03-26 18:04:38","15","9","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/87b8b7/replacing_the_zero_wasteresuables_movement_with/","True","yabukatsuset","1747879229.9753768","zero waste","manual"
