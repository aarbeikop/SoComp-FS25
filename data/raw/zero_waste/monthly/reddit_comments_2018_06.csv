There is always stuff in the news about ski resorts having less snow than before with shorter and shorter seasons that suggest skiing there may not even be possible soon.

What this often fails to mention though is that this means less melt water in the spring and summer to keep the rivers down mountain flowing. The issue of not having enough snow to ski on is really an issue of all the places reliant on those mountains for water no longer having enough to drink or grow crops.

Whereas other places that are seeing increasingly frequent and powerful storms and annual rainfalls in the space of hours or days are being washed away. I'm sure I saw something on the news recently about a NASA satellite that had pointed to a change in the distribution of fresh water around the globe but you don't even need equipment like that to see it when you just consider all the stories of things like this happening from all over and look at it as one and the same problem.","2018-06-18 11:32:20","34","Fredex8","1747881339.2357278","zero waste","manual"

What do people expect to happen? when you get a few million people all in one location, thats a LOT of water they are going to drink and a lot of shit they are producing. Of course the aquifer, the reservoir and the river cannot possibly sustain so many people drinking it dry. And now with less rain fall it's even more of a strain for the aquifer to replenish. So what do they do? they pipe in water from somewhere else.... which dries up... and so on. 

It's less about mismanagement and more about TOO MANY PEOPLE.
