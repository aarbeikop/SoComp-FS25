You might want to look at similar businesses and take inspiration from there.
I don't know exactly what kind yours will be but guess it's a shop for zero waste food.

Zero waste grocers from my country translated:

* Gooodyfooods
* Dill & Chamomile (which rhymes in Dutch)
* Simply Delicious
* Eden's Garden
* Rawsome
* Olives and shit

Or you can do a play on words, in my language the word for **wares** is the same as for **real** so there is an entire chain under that name.","2018-07-10 18:11:28","1","Consume-o-tron-3000","1747882387.650381","zero waste","manual"

"e2v04iy","t3_90qc9i","90qc9i","sustainability","action-oriented","This is very conscientious thinking, I respect that a lot. There is some cool technology out there to extract water out of the air, called atmospheric generators, that can run on solar panel and produce hundreds of gallons of water a day, especially useful in arid regions. Essentially these generators are composed of a dehumidifier, filtration system, and a storage unit. 

You should check out this cool source of information, Earth Nation. It seems to be this organization that helps businesses share technology, economics, and solutions to help clean the world and set up sustainable community resources such as clean food and water. They seem pretty environmentally minded and they are creating a cryptocurrency to fund businesses that can solve global problems.
