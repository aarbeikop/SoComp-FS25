Hey everyone,

My name is Chris and I am launching a Zero\-Waste and Vegan festival this summer and looking to spread the word to fellow vegans and eco\-conscious warriors.

I asked the moderator If it would be ok to share the festival website with you so please excuse if this feels like a promotion, I simply just want to make more like\-minded people aware of the festival.

No Planet B Festival is taking place this August 17th\-19th has been born out of a desire to bring vegans, minimalists, zero wasters and the ‘Just Curious’ together for talks, workshops and fitness activities from the best experts in their fields such James Aspey, Shia Shu, Aine Carlin, Kristen Leo, Active Vegans, Girl Gone Green and many more...

The vision is to unite the largest social movements of our time to spread awareness about how to live in a more sustainable and ethical way.

I would love to hear your feedback :\)
