“Water security is one of the most tangible and fastest growing social, political and economic challenge faced today.”
World Economic Forum (2016)


1. Water Risks is an Increasing Concern 
By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. It will be 11 billion by 2100. All these people will need water to meet their most basic needs. Agriculture, industry and domestic life rely on the abundant supply of safe water. However, this is by no means guaranteed and unpredictable water quality and availability represent one of the decade’s top emerging risks. 
Freshwater risk management is complex to assess. Such difficulty stems from the paradoxical nature of water: it is plentiful to many yet its scarcity affects hundreds of millions of people, it is both fossil and renewable, it is freely supplied by nature but its treatment, distribution, and wastage have a cost. 
Water risks are often underestimated, disregarded or simply ignored. This results in a global lack of preparation for future impacts and has implications for the world’s population, as a majority of water risks represent externalities which are not properly assessed. Consequently, all research and reports identified future concerns, especially in the following areas: 
■ World population will have to respond to a growing frequency and severity of losses; 
■ Awareness levels could be improved and drinking water will have a role in increasing understanding; 
■ The World need significant innovation in drinking water by directing big investments into innovative projects, technologies, and asset lines. 
■ The difficulty to assess future water risks is emphasized by the advent of new technologies and big infrastructure projects the eventual effects of which are as yet unclear.


2. What Are the Risks? 
A number of water risks are considered in this paper, including the impact of scarcity, pollution, water-related illnesses, treatment and topics of social, political and economic interests. 
Natural resources are unequally distributed around the world. Physical water scarcity, or the literal lack of water, is gradually worsening in many areas. Economic water scarcity from lack of finance or inadequate water management will lead to the rapid depletion of usable water resources. Such shortages will inevitably have implications for a wide range of insurance lines of business: property, agriculture, casualty, life, and health.
Ensuring clean water supply is a key to socioeconomic development. A failure to deliver or maintain a clean water supply can be inhibiting for any society. Many emerging countries are less capable of treating their water due to insufficient economic means. Water treatment in developed countries is subject to increasingly stringent regulations and quality standards to address pollution. Furthermore, treatment plants are considered as critical infrastructure that can potentially disseminate toxic products on a large scale as a result of human error or terrorist attack. Such a large scale event in a major city could seriously impact the world’s population.


3. Water is plentiful on earth, yet scarcity affects hundreds of million people worldwide.
Only 3% of global water resources are in the form of freshwater (in glaciers, ice caps, groundwater, lakes, soils, rivers, atmosphere and within living organisms); 97% is salt water in the oceans. Humanity does not lack water as such but faces shortages of fresh water readily available for consumption. This is aggravated by uneven geographical distribution, erratic supplies, and evolving trends in worldwide water patterns. 

4. Water resources: both fossil and renewable
Water moves continuously between different reservoirs, following a natural hydrological cycle. The turnaround time of water is about 10 days in the atmosphere and a few weeks in rivers, which makes it effectively renewable. On the contrary, water replacement in deep aquifers can last for hundreds to thousands of years: it is a non-renewable fossil resource (like oil) when withdrawals exceed the annual recharge. The increasing human demand gradually takes its toll on fossil water, some resources are already depleted at rates far superior to their replacement times. 

5. Water is free, but treatment, distribution, and mismanagement have a cost
Access to water from rivers, wells or dedicated infrastructures is generally free but this water is often unsafe if untreated. On a larger scale, industries, services, and agricultural structures rely on water as a cheap and abundant resource. Yet they often operate without a clear consciousness of the impact of their individual operations on the environment and on other users. A largely unsuspected price (“the true price of water”) includes treatment and distribution and extends to the cost of leakages, evaporation, contaminations, inefficient usage and wasteful practices. 

6. Water brings life, yet it can kill
 
Since it sheltered the emergence of life 4 billion years ago, it has been irreplaceable for humans’ survival and basic needs (drinking, food, sanitation, and dignity). But unsafe waters impact public health through contamination and spread of infectious diseases. 

7. Water: a public or a private asset?
Even though water supply is a key political issue for every government and community, it is often treated and distributed by major corporate companies whose objective is profit. The decision on water management is always a local compromise between the various stakeholders and the society as a whole. 

8. Water is a global issue, yet management is local
Water is at the same time a shared asset and a common cause of risk. It is usable countless times by different actors in different locations, provided that those usages do not impact on its quality or availability for the next user. But unless mutual coordination and respect of others are upheld, sharing water may trigger liabilities and conflicts.

9. Water projects generate development but may induce concerns 
Water supports the dynamics of human societies. Major cultures and civilizations developed in direct proximity to water sources. Good water management greatly enhanced the growth of communities. New technologies are still being introduced to master water resources: desalination plants, water recycling, nanotechnologies. 

 
“There is no substitute for water”
Rattan Lal, Director of the School of Environment and Natural Resources, Ohio State University

10. Origins of Water Scarcity and Expected Developments 

Water scarcity originates from the deficiency in water availability to meet the different users’ needs and can take different forms: usage exceeding resources, limited access to resources due to the lack of infrastructure, to inadequate sanitation or to pollution. Water scarcity results from a complex interplay of multiple factors. The physical absence of water is the most obvious cause, but poor water management and anthropic causes are contributing to a greater and greater extent.

 11. Type of water resources 

Different types of renewable water resources need to be distinguished:
- Blue water is the part of rainfall going directly to rivers by runoff or infiltrating into the ground to feed the aquifers and it is a major renewable water resource. 
- Green water is the part of rainfall temporarily stored into the upper soil layer, and taken back to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and transpiration of vegetation and it is another major renewable water resource. 
- Ice, by melting and it is renewable if new snow compensates each year for the melted part. 
- Apart from these renewable water resources, Fossil water stored in aquifers is non-sustainable ‘blue-water’ groundwater stocks are increasingly tapped into and will eventually run out. 


12. New technologies and Innovations 

As the need for water treatment is growing, new technologies are being developed. Desalination is an emerging process increasingly used. It is more energy intensive than traditional water treatments and, because of its cost,
 is only adapted for dry regions. Large projects are developing in the Middle East, in the US, Australia, and Europe 
Other alternatives aim at reducing the environmental impact of water treatment.
Treating large quantities of reused water to make it drinkable again would require enormous amounts of energy: 
for that reason and for cultural ones – event treated, some people have trouble accepting the fact that they are drinking wastewater – it is still not acceptable at an industrial scale. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.

13. True cost of water 

The true cost of water is a key starting point. It looks beyond just the price of the cubic meter as it encompasses also monetization of water related risks having already materialized for cities and industries while looking as well as indirect costs and missed opportunities. 
Indeed assessing the true cost of water is not straightforward and includes several aspects: 
1. Direct costs: Water price, cost of treatment plants and of other infrastructures. In Europe the price of potable water to the public varies from 1€/m3 (Italy) to 6.4€/m3 (Denmark). The water resources available and the state subsidies vary from one country to another. 
2. Indirect costs: Such as cost of public relations, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), lawyers, fines. 
3. Risks impacts: Such as remediation costs and downtime in case of pollution, drought, flooding. 
4. Missed opportunities: Positive impact of good water management in terms of investors’ attractiveness and opportunities in creating new revenue streams by selling treated wastewater to third parties for reuse. It includes as well new financial opportunities to capture, such as negotiating better insurance premium when mitigating risks and enhancing resilience & robustness.

14. The World need innovative approaches and solutions 

•Technological solutions 
•Smart investments 
•Integration with other functions 
•Instead of reïnventing the wheel, let’s learn from nature 

15. Blue Planet, Scarce Water 

We live on a watery planet, but less than 1% of all that freshwater is available for ecosystems and human use in
rivers, lakes, and aquifers. Yet, these life-giving freshwater systems face a host of threats from over-abstraction, 
fragmentation, pollution, climate change, and the ever-increasing demands of a growing population. 

16. Water for Drinking 

Healthy freshwater systems provide drinking water. In fact, while we need only drink 3-5 liters per day to 
remain healthy, the food we eat, clothes we wear, the energy we consume and products we use daily 
take tens of thousands of liters to produce.
A systemic and cross-sectoral ‘urban ecosystem’ approach is needed to design and implement
solutions to the multifaceted challenges. The main objective of this priority is to help design, implement and upscale
place-based and people-based transition pathways towards resilient, sustainable, low-carbon and resource efficient urban area.


17. Next step

We need to launch our eWATER solution to raise international awareness about the importance of water and identify strategies to raise the awareness of our clients and consumers. Advanced technologies permit individual drinkable water reuse. Point-of-use water treatment systems, i.e. portable water purification devices, can cleanse drinking water at an affordable cost in individual homes or commercial establishments. Decentralized treatment systems offer an interesting alternative as they require less investment and simplify the access of households to wastewater treatments.


18. eWATER solution - revolution

We at Zero Carbon a smart water tech startup, are dedicated to environmental preservation by developing and deploying societal and disruptive technologies. Our mission is very ambitious – we want to provide safe and clean drinking water to all world population every day, anytime and anywhere. Without any extra infrastructure at an affordable cost.

Picture this, a water ATM in the middle of the busy city, on a busy street that produces the purest, high-quality pure drinking water available today. Out of air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also beneficial to your health. Our consumers pay per use with coins, mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract.
We can supply world population with most important substances on earth the drinking water. 




 “Without major technological innovations there is little hope of bringing the water equation into balance. There is no doubt that many technological changes can help improve services for millions and reduce the stress on water systems around the world.”
                                                                                                                   The World Water Council 



How it works
eWATER is a pay per- use drinking water refill ATM system. As the name implies, is a sort of a water vending machine except that in a water is produced out of the air. The water produced is not only pure and free of any contaminants but also available on demand 24/7 all year around. 
Our consumers pay per use of drinking water before refill bottle they have. 

They pay with coins, use mobile payment or smart wearables linked to blockchain smart contract. Payment goes into the machine in return for water. 

These machines are built, owned and operated by ZERO CARBON. The water ATM is providing safe and clean drinking water every day, anytime and anywhere. 

This concept will totally reduce the financial burden of the government cost of the water infrastructure. 

We will provide drinking water to people in the range of 10-20 cent euro (€0.10 – 0.20) per 1 liter on a pilot basis.

eWATER ATMs have the following advantages for consumers:
•	24 x 7 provision 
•	Water quality accountability and control
•	Pay-per-use methodology
•	Price transparency and flexible purchase
•	No Water Shortage
•	Eliminate overuse of PET bottles
 They also benefit project stakeholders as follows:
•	Off-grid functionality and environment-friendly
•	Low O&M requirement ensure water fee is affordable
•	Information layering (through cloud connectivity) for accountability (tracking each user transaction)
•	Service optimisation by monitoring key process parameters real-time online
•	Adaptable to various location types (streets, outdoor community spaces, school, hospital, etc.
•	Potential for targeted subsidies
•	Increases social impact

"6yxqaq","collapse","skeptical","Radio: what to look for, a short overview...","It's post collapse time... And as we all know *(or should know)* Knowledge is the key to moving forward and the transmission of knowledge can never be a choke point... 

Enter the Radio; here is my short synopsis on what to look for and be aware of concerning radio... Not an all inclusive list of course, but hell, ya gotta start somewhere..

So start looking for radios with microphones... Know the difference between Amateur Radios and crap, and trust me almost anything else is crap...

**CB Radios:**

CB radios work on the 11meter band, 27Mhz-ish, and they are AM, -sigh- there is no greater way to waste your time trying to communicate with someone than using AM, Amplitude Modulation, on frequencies that our atmosphere and our sun have deemed as crap too... Well crap most of the time... If you see a CB radio, and it's your only freakin' hope don't hope for much, most only run very low power *(QRP)* without massive amplifiers, and did I mention they are AM... but if that's all you got, then that's all you got... Listen on you CB just before sunrise, The Grey Line, this is the best time for long distance *(DX)* comm, also too at sunset to a lesser degree... we don't have enough time to go into the Antennas and Amplifiers and Atmospheric Propagation needed to make CB's work halfway decent...

**Shortwave Radios:**

[Shortwave Radios *(SW)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio) can become your best friend in the *Year Zero.* SW radios run on very low power *(usually 6 volts or so)* of which, you could probably power them up with a [Voltaic Pile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile) or an [Earth Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_battery)...  Most SW radios are designed to Receive the Long, Medium, and Short Wave bands of the Electromagnetic Radio Spectrum...

Longwave AM Radio = 148.5 kHz – 283.5 kHz *(LF)*

Mediumwave AM Radio = 525 kHz – 1710 kHz *(MF)*

Shortwave AM Radio = 3 MHz – 30 MHz *(HF)*

...but I thought you said AM suckz...! yeah it does, but most SW *broadcasts* are made in AM because an AM receiver can be made out of just about anything and that is why SW *broadcasts* are given in AM so poor countries can make receivers out of junk and countries that are run by dictators can't control what people can hear... **BUT...** most modern SW radios have side band capabilities too...!

Yeah...! just a quick word about Sideband *(SSB)* or [Single Side band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation), basically- what you do is you chop the crappy energy wasting overly broadbanded AM signal in half, and pack all of the energy of an AM signal into half or less the package... This results in greater performance *(much greater)* and less power consumption... you have 2 vestigial sidebands; Lower and Upper *(LSB and USB)* many SW broadcasts are out there on USB *(USB is more popular than LSB for no particular reason)* like Armed Forces Radio uses USB for their broadcasts...

So... a SW radio with SSB capabilities can be amazing and they are cheap, not to easy to build, it can be done, but not super simple like with AM receivers ... and a SW Radio with SSB will be able to tune into the person to person comm of Amateur Radios...

**Marine/Police/Utility/Radios**

Marine radios are *like* CB's in that they are channelized and some look very similar; but the Marine Radios have a distinct advantage... First of all they are FM *(YES! thank you Lord!)* and they have a little kick to them 10-20watts of power... most run off of 12v DC and are built like a brick-shit-house... Marine Radios are what is called Simplex *(there is much more to Marine Radio than what you see here, but this is what you are likely to run into)* so yeah Simplex... Simplex just means person to person *on the same frequency* ... so REDROBIN is talking to you on 156.8 MHz and you are talking back to REDROBIN on 156.8 MHz, y'all are sharing the same frequency... which is not always the case with Police and Utility *(gas/water company)* Radios... but we'll get to that later...

Marine Radio, the one in question here, is VHF so they operate on channels from 156.0Mhz to 174Mhz all over the world, but VHF very seldom *(and I mean like never-ever)* do VHF signals stretch beyond the horizon they can and they do but mostly because of a persons elevation, and as we all know light bends around the corner a little bit so too with radio waves... Marines radios are a good find and are FM so none of this foolishness with AM... 

Police/Utility Radios; are probably gonna be useless, you might get lucky, but I doubt it... here's why... Police and Utility Company Radios 95% of the time ""run split"", they use split frequency pairs through repeaters to give their signals very wide coverage; but unless the Repeater is up and running they are boat anchors, and cord wood... **UNLESS** you can reprogram them, you might get lucky and find some with single channel SIMPLEX on them but it's not likely... Let me explain... Police/Utility Company Radios transmit *(TX)* on one frequency and receive *(RX)* on another, and they use whats called a repeater as the interface between...

So *REDROBIN* will TX on 155.625Mhz and RX on 154.625Mhz to the repeater site, with his radio, the signal will go through a [*duplexer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplexer) from the antenna *(way up on a mountain usually)* the duplexer will take in the TX and rebroadcast the signal on the RX frequency *simultaneously* with a little help along the way from the [*repeater controller*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_repeater)... Very nifty and handy when you can get a repeater up and running, and keep it running... 

But not so good if you are scavenging for radios... 

The crazy good/bad thing about Police/Utility radios is there are thousands of them in wherehouses in every municipality, they frickin' last forever *(90% of them are [MIL-SPEC/STD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Standard))* and even if you find one that is old and moldy chances are it'll work *(power up)* after years of abuse...

So what is the solution to this shit-sandwich dilemma...? 

On one hand you have radios built like brick-shit-houses but on the other, they are damn useless without a fricking repeater...!

1) Find the repeater site that is associated with the radios, and power it back up *(again, a lot of the repeaters are built pretty tough too)* to make your radios comm back and forth... this would be ideal...

2) Reprogram the radio to work [*Simplex*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_communication) *(person to person)* just like you think radios to work... I talk----you talk, on the same freq....

Reprogramming cables are just as wide and varied as the frickin' radios that are connected to them... [*(damnit man!)*](http://imgur.com/gallery/PYp3O) and then you have to have the software and the drivers.... I know right...? but you might get lucky, when you breakinto city hall or the municipal garage and find the radio guy's corner of the room and there it all is... -angels singing- -claps of thunder- laid out before you are all of the repeater site locations, operating frequencies, dispatcher locations, mountains of radios, antennas and coax...

What you need is [Selectivity](https://goo.gl/GH3ezB) *(a technical term, that basically means right here right now)* and most importantly a [Variable Frequency Oscillator *(VFO)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-frequency_oscillator)

**Amateur Radios (HAM)**

Ham Radios combine all of the above into one package... You can choose what frequency you want to talk on [*(Ham Radios are easily modded too)*](https://www.mods.dk/) because you have a VFO, which is a fancy way of saying that your radio has the ability to tune to any frequency you want it to, without having to program it or useing channels... 

Ham radios cover a wide portion of the Electromagnetic Spectrum and, they can run Simplex or Duplex *(on HF frequencies they call this ""Running Split"")* you can operate them on different [*Modes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amateur_radio_modes) like AM, FM, WFM *(wide FM)* SSB, *(Single-Side Band)* CW *(Continuous Wave or Morse Code)* and a thousand different Digital Modes...

Ham Radios generally fall into 2 or 3 groups...

1) Two Meter / 440 Radios *(2m/70cm)* 

2) HF and HF+ Radios

3) SDR Radios

**Two Meter / 440 Radios (2m/70cm)**

2m Radios are the bread and butter of most Ham Shacks, and pretty much every ham has one or has had one... They are single band radios that cover the 2 Meter Wavelength from 144.000MHz to 148.000MHz most of these are FM radios designed to work through a repeater... hold up... BUT they have VFO's and you can swap easily from Duplex to Simplex at the push of a button... 90% of 2m Radios are FM and the Mobile Radios run around 50watts while the HandHeld versions usually do like 5Watts

440 Radios are just like 2m radios but they use different frequencies 420.000Mhz to 450.000MHz and operate at a higher wavelength (70cm) that's it... They are very common and a lot of the time you will find radios that are ""Dual Band"" radios that have just the 2m and 70cm bands on them... very popular for use in mobile applications...

**HF+ radios:**

These Ham radios cover some of the MF and all of HF Radio and usually all (or most) of the VHF and parts of the UHF Radio Frequency Spectrum... So they operate on multiple ""Bands"" and in different modes, if you so desire, to cover the most effective Long Distance *(DX)* Comms in order to match [what is going on in the Atmosphere and the Sun...](http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/)

HF Frequencies and the radios that accompany them have the ability to consistently communicate over great and remote distances... Like Russia or Japan or ɐılıɐɹʇsnɐ... I used to talk to a guy, before the solar cycle took a shit, every night in Siberian Russia, like he was next door mate... 

So some DX frequencies are more effective at night; some are more effective in the daylight *(this has to do with the layers of the [Ionosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere) being more ionized by the sun and less ionization with less sunlight)* 

Some Frequencies are more effective at Solar Minimum, and some are more effective at [Solar Maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum) *(The Sun goes through an 11 year cycle from top to bottom of heavy output of radiation and lighter output of radiation)* 

So with an ""HF Rig"", you as a radio man, can adapt to what the universe is doing and have the most effective comm...

Some HF rigs have built in [Digital Modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amateur_radio_modes) of comm, that can pull out very weak signals from the noise...

**Software Defined Radios (SDR)**

Software Defined Radios (SDR) have all the operating abilities that the other Ham Radios have but with a SDR Radio you can [see the entire Radio Spectrum at a glance](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/) and use the Digital Modes with out a computer interface... Because the Radio does this all for you... 

...-.- ...-.-.  ..--.. -.. . -.- .. ....- -.-. .-.. --..

So keep your eyes open for radios when you go back into the cities to scavenge for resources... 

Old Radios sometimes are the most resilient and can take a lot of damage and still operate... 

Also you need to keep in mind how you are going to power up your new found treasure... Most Ham radios run off of 12vdc around 20amps or so of current drain...

[Hope this helps...](http://imgur.com/gallery/Ii0Mz) and I'll feild any questions y'all might have...
