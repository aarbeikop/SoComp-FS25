Not only that, but he thinks that this literal mars-shot will have better odds than trying to reverse the trends in a place where **humans are perfectly suited**. It's almost a complete resignation that caters only to the mega-rich and those already insulated from collapse.  Even if he succeeds, the chances of having a gene pool that allows for future success in terraforming on any scale are almost zero.  He's basically trying to enrich himself so that he can have a half-decent end to his life, by suspending the delusions of the rich that they will carry on humanity.

Meanwhile, our paradise burns while the only biodiversity within lightyears is irreversibly lost forever.  It's easy to see that we will fail against mass extinction, even the actions of our most prominent scientists indicate that they're only interested in money and fame.","2018-12-05 17:04:34","41","Dixnorkel","1747885836.06628","zero waste","manual"

Again, this will self regulate with supple and demand.

What fascinates me about Elon Musk is that it was not long ago that I agreed with him; that humans would rise to the challenge and infect the universe with living matter. 

That was back when I was unaware of my bias around the availability of free energy. The depths of the Recession, before things actually bounced back, plus subject matter that would have been at home r/collapse opened my eyes to the futility of reaching for the stars. 

Besides our home here, our mother Earth, the entire universe is a vacuum of guaranteed mortality. It is the height of our hubris to take something as basic as *breathing* for granted.

>We're going to need carbon-neutral agricultural fertilizers to make enough food to feed the world.

Fertilizer is part of the problem. It kills our soils and turns them from carbon sinks into carbon emitters. Poop, on the other hand, is a by-product of raising food animals, and can be an excellent fertilizer.

>We're going to run out of clean water.

This is going to be the biggest problem. No argument on this point!

>We're going to run out of metals and rare earths.

But then we just run out of iPhones and at the end of the day (civilization) who cares?

>And then there's the carbon question. We can't bring carbon emissions to zero without having a carbon-neutral energy source cheap enough to make carbon sequestration economically viable.

The cheapest way to sequester carbon is to leave plants that are sequestering carbon alone and let them do it. Until we invent a self-replicating machine which does not compete with living beings for resources and sequesters carbon via sunlight, we are just going to have to work with the plants and animals that have been doing it best for longest. If we got all our feed animals out of livestock prisons and back on to the land, managed with either predators or electric fence, returned half the grasslands to actual grasslands ecosystems, we could sequester enough carbon to return to pre-industrial levels. What machine can we make that can tout a similar outcome?
