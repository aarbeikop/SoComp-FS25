Small changes make the biggest difference.","To protect our environment and encourage sustainability, you can make small strides to adapt your lifestyle to be more conscious of the environment around us. The number one power that you as an individual to respond to climate change is through your **purchasing power**. Yes, this means you need to be more conscious of what you buy, support companies who make it their mission to work with the environment and not against it. 

A small routine purchase that everyone needs to buy whether you are living a zero waste lifestyle, or a minimalist is a toothbrush. A company, **One Brush, One Tree strives to turn the routine purchase of buying a toothbrush into a movement to create a BIG, positive change on our Planet**. 

Not everyone has the time or money to promote environmental sustainability, this company takes it into their own hands by donating funds to a non-profit organization to **plant a tree for every toothbrush sold**. And these aren’t any usual toothbrush, they sell both bamboo and pressed wheat toothbrushes that are 100% biodegradable and made with sustainability sourced materials.

Trillions of plastic pieces floating around and polluting our beaches, oceans and fresh water supplies this second. While your plastic toothbrush is taking hundreds of years to decompose. The average American will throw use 300 toothbrushes in their lifetime! Could you imagine the positive impact that could be made to the environment if every individual took it upon themselves to be more conscious about this everyday purchase? **We often overlook small purchases and don’t know how making small purchase can have a large positive impact on the planet.** These small changes you make to your lifestyle require little effort with great rewards. 

One Brush One Tree strives to create a community where it’s simple to give back and care for the environment, while fostering gratitude for the one and only planet we have. **Everyone can feel they can make BIG change through the small action of buying a toothbrush.** Be proud that through buying a plastic-free, biodegradable toothbrush, you are able to reduce your carbon footprint and support reforestation!

"9rcljp","collapse","skeptical","Literature on Overpopulation, Immigration, and Ethics","A lot of the discussion surrounding overpopulation inevitably leans towards immigrants, developing nations/third-world countries, and whether those immigrants are to blame.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First, as an issue of source-knowledge, we should be skeptical of the green anti-immigrants and anti-population folks such as Tanton, Hardin, and Ehrlich. They were kicked out of the Sierra Club for a reason, and it's not ""political correctness."" These people just cook the facts. This is from Ian Angus and Simon Butler, the editor of *Climate and Capitalism* and co-editor of *Green Left Weekly* ( [https://books.google.com/books?id=DFxW8qWimskC&source=gbs\_navlinks\_s](https://books.google.com/books?id=DFxW8qWimskC&source=gbs_navlinks_s))

Tanton chaired the Sierra Club’s Population Committee in the early 1970s and was president of Zero Population Growth (ZPG) from 1975 to 1977. After ZPG refused to endorse his proposal for an anti-immigration campaign, he founded FAIR in 1978; the founding directors included Garrett Hardin and Paul Ehrlich. Since then he has initiated and funded many other anti-immigration groups, each designed to appeal to a specific audience, each presented as independent of the others.

It’s tempting to dismiss Tanton and his associates as marginal cranks, but their influence is significant and growing. FAIR, which focuses on lobbying federal and state governments, claims to have been invited to testify before congressional committees more often than any other organization, and in association with NumbersUSA it has successfully used mass lobbying to derail legislative proposals to give legal status to undocumented workers.

FAIR’s legal affiliate, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), assisted in drafting SB1070, the anti-immigrant law approved in Arizona in 2010. FAIR president Dan Stein describes SB1070 as “a law that both represents the interests of legal Arizonians and serves as model legislation for other states.”21 Elected politicians in fortyone states are members of FAIR’s legislative arm, State Legislators for Legal Immigration (SLLI); in May 2010 it was reported that SLLI-affiliated politicians had proposed Arizona-style laws in at least seven other states. 22

CIS provides intellectual ammunition for the anti-immigration movement. Although it claims to conduct “independent, non-partisan” research, it has, as Mark Potok comments, “never found any aspect of immigration that it liked.”23

A frequently cited CIS research paper attempts to assign hard numbers to the argument that by coming to the United States immigrants increase global greenhouse gas emissions. The authors claim:

If the current stock of immigrants in the United States had stayed in their countries of origin rather than migrating to the United States, their estimated annual CO2 emissions would have been only 155 metric tons, assuming these immigrants had the average level of CO2 emissions for a person living in their home countries.This is 482 million tons less than the estimated 637 tons they will produce in the United States.This 482 million ton increase represents the impact of immigration on global emissions. It is equal to approximately 5 percent of the increase in annual world-wide CO2 emissions since 1980. 24

They reach those conclusions despite their admission that “one obstacle to estimating annual immigrant and native-born per capita CO2 emission rates is that there are no data that disaggregate rates of these two population cohorts.”25 In place of real numbers, they use their own estimates, which they base on per capita income figures that are themselves estimates.

NumbersUSA, the populist voice of the Tanton network, blames immigration for unemployment, low wages, urban sprawl, congestion, overcrowded schools, lost open spaces, and more. Its president, Roy Beck, says such problems are caused by “bad recent public policies that raised the volume of national immigration above social, economic, educational, cultural, and environmental thresholds.”26

There's one more piece of evidence to hammer that idea home. It's NOT that discussions about sustainability SHOULDN'T include overpopulation, but it should reject oversimplified narratives of immigration, moral hazard, third-world countries, etc. Jenny Levinson writes this ( r/http://imagine2050.newcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/ATB_shortreport.pdf )

There should be no taboo on discussing population — a topic clearly tied to environmental concerns, as in fact is every human interaction within ecological systems. What should be rejected are racism and simplistic arguments that over-emphasize the “numbers game” at the expense of other factors — interlocking issues of production and consumption, patterns of land use, technology and planning, globalization and poverty, the status of women in society, as well as wasteful cycles of boom and bust. This remains true no matter how much ecological damage we believe societies may have produced. Such a social and ecological outlook is vitally important in overcoming “man versus nature” thinking.

Environmentalists who believe in holistic diversity need to be on guard — not just regarding Apply The Brakes, but also regarding other anti-immigrant groups using similar rhetoric. Groups with misleading or seemingly transparent names like Progressives for Immigration Reform, Negative Population Growth, and NumbersUSA — as well as others in Tanton’s network of anti-immigrant organizations — all seek to inject bigotry into environmental and population issues.

As a capital-T-Truth issue, bringing in more immigrants is actually net-better for the environment, and certainly not as bad as domestic migration/domestic population growth. Carmel Price, a post-doctoral fellow at Furman, does an analysis of multiple studies ( r/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-011-9216-3#Sec11 )  

These findings hold noteworthy implications for competing theoretical arguments about the environmental impact of immigration. Our results conflict with arguments drawn from population pressure and social disorganization positions, which suggest that immigration contributes to environmental harm by increasing population pressures on local ecosystems and by destabilizing communities in ways that inhibit collective action for addressing social problems like pollution. Rather, the null effects of immigration on air pollution observed here are more consistent with the ecological footprint and community resource positions, which suggest that immigration may not be harmful to (and may even be supportive of) local environments and communities. As the ecological footprint perspective suggests and as illustrated here, the different forms of population growth are likely to have complex and possibly quite different impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Based on this position, it is not altogether surprising that population growth from immigration appears to be less taxing on the environment than domestic migration and natural population growth, perhaps due to differences in lifestyles of the foreign- and U.S.-born or the potential stabilizing effects of immigration. ...

In addition, our results provide key political implications for law makers and social scientists interested in the social consequences of contemporary immigration flows and whether these demographic shifts are harmful to local communities. In terms of air pollution, our study clearly suggests that immigrants, at least in the short run, are not contributing to increased environmental harm, which raises serious questions about the validity of claims concerning the “environmental threat” of immigration and calls to reduce immigration in order to curtail environmental harm (Population-Environment Balance 1992, p. 306; see reviews in Kraly 1995, 1998; Stevens 2010). Although additional research that builds on this analysis is needed to more thoroughly explore immigration-environment relationships, our study suggests that critical commentary and policies calling for reduced immigration on the grounds that it harms the environment may not be in line with social realities.

And the economics of population-advocates don't add up. No amount of population control will actually change consumption patterns, because most environmental damage isn't local. Lyman Stone, a population and migration researcher writes this (r/https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/12/12/16766872/overpopulation-exaggerated-concern-climate-change)

The concern with overpopulation, naturally, often dovetails with concerns about climate change. *Won’t higher population devastate the environment?* We can answer that question fairly easily, making use of forecasts of population, GDP per capita, and emissions intensity per dollar by country. We can come up with some scenarios and then compare them to estimates of emissions needed to keep global warming manageable.

I show a daunting number of scenarios above, but they’re color-coded to make following them easier. The greenish lines show emissions under different population scenarios. The most steeply climbing line assumes only a modest decline in global fertility rates, while the lowest (green) scenario assumes a very rapid decline in total fertility rates — frankly, an unattainable decline.

The teal line assumes that fertility rates in every country go directly to replacement rate in 2016 (down for most poor countries, up for rich ones), and stay there. The central green line assumes fertility declines in the future following the historic trend. As you can see from these crude extrapolations, fertility rates do have substantial long-run effects on emissions.

But note those two gray lines. They’re important: They show where emissions need to go in order to prevent sharp rises in global temperatures. The paler of the two shows emissions required for less than 2 degree Celsius increase, broadly seen as the benchmark for a “serious” global warming solution. The darker gray line would get us down to a 2.5 to 2.7 degree increase, which is more or less what the Paris climate agreement committed participating countries to strive for. *No amount of population control achieves those goals.*

As an issue of political correctness, it's really not that scary to denounce green anti-immigrant hysteria for what it is. It is racist, and Malcolm King articulates the history well ([https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/rise-populationists-greenwashes-racism](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/rise-populationists-greenwashes-racism) )

 In uncertain times such as these, the populationists blame immigrants (and poor African women) for all of the woes of modern society. Between 1960 and 1980 more than 20 million people worldwide were cajoled or forced into having intrauterine device implants, hysterectomies or vasectomies. In the US they were mainly the mentally ill, single mothers and the disabled. By the 1970s, the evangelical fervour of the Third World populationist push of the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Trust and former US secretary of defense Robert McNamara, had failed to make a dent in population growth. For all of their scientific studies, propaganda, research and the millions of dollars spent, population control simply did not work.  

 Population control is far more complex than implanting IUDs, injecting people with the contraceptive Depo Provera or offering them cash to be sterilised. The anti-population literature from the 1960s and 70s is hauntingly familiar to the strident language used by the SPA and its allies here. They turned political problems into biological problems and human history was recast as natural history. The SPP, SPGN and the SPA have been picking at the scab of immigration for some years. Like Pauline Hanson in a koala suit, they cloak reactionary politics in the garb of environmentalism, but — unlike the Greens — they have no environmental credentials. They “green wash” their policies by appealing to environmental values, while promoting the tired idea that Asians, and now Africans, are waiting to invade via immigration.

&#x200B;

Finally, to finish the discussion first off, Raphael Nawrotzki from the University of Minnesota writes that studies indicate it's possible immigrants who see a rise in living standards would actually help offset unsustainable ecological practices, and that even if it's wrong we still need to develop ethical standards to address the unavoidable phenomenon of immigration. (r/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035111 )

On the other hand, studies (see Taylor et al. 1996 and references therein) find that migration may have a very beneficial impact on migrant-sending households and communities since the additional income through remittances may relieve financial constraints and encourage investment in new technologies (e.g. drought resistant crops, rainwater harvest systems).

However, even if we assume that encouraging migration might not be the best way to address climate change induced livelihood problems, a number of reasons suggest that migration is unavoidable, thus requiring the ethical consideration of its implications: 1. Frequently, people have already lost their livelihoods through harvest failure and increased desertification and have left their homes (McLeman and Hunter 2010). For these migrants, long-term measures to improve livelihood situations in their country of origin will not provide the help necessary to improve their current situation. Also, in the case of sea level rise, where land completely disappears, adaptation “in place” is not an option (Shen and Gemenne 2011). 2. It is unlikely that transfer of funds from MDCs will be large enough to prevent livelihood destruction in all poor countries of the world and thus, outmigration is unavoidable. 3. A further problem is that LDCs frequently constitute what has been called “failed states” (Di John 2010), with highly corrupt or nonexistent governments. In such situations, it is difficult to ensure that funds for adaptation measures reach the needy population. Henceforth, it appears to be important to develop clear ethical standards to evaluate the issue of climate migration as a problematic, yet unavoidable phenomenon.
