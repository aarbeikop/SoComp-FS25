"7pwbmq","collapse","skeptical","100% Renewables = 100% Impossible","I just thought of something. Vaclav Smil says complete and total energy transitions take take like **70 years** and cost many trillions of dollars to complete. Yet, wind and solar energy products only last **30 years**. All the solar panels and wind turbines you see now will need to be replaced long before we even complete the transition. Their life span is 50% of a 100% transition. They break down at twice the speed of the transition. We do not have enough critical minerals as it is, even if they lasted forever. Recycling them uses more energy than making new ones, and is fraught with fraud. Look at car batteries, we just ship them to Mexico because it's cheaper to recycle them there, cheaper and more dangerous.

What really concerns me is that why is it that a dumb ass hick like me has to be the one to figure this shit out, and not some overpaid professor? Look at that Stanford renewable energy bullshit report put out last summer. They basically said we can 100% renewable energy next weekend if we close our eyes and click our heels together 3 times.

Our schools are teaching kids that everything is the fault of over-privileged white male heterosexuals. This is the same kind of shit Hitler taught saying everything was the Jews' fault. Our schools are not grounded in reality. If a guy can get a Phd saying there are multiple universes, and another guy can get a Phd studying life after death, then what fucking practical use are they? When Cern ""proved"" the Higgs Boson particle, the only thing they proved was the validation of their overpaid jobs. Theory is just theory and shouldn't be confused with reality. 

I think the number one reason for collapse is dishonesty.

P.S. - I should have used ""hypothesis"" instead of ""theory"", but the confusion isn't only mine, and I believe people try to pass both theory and hypothesis off as fact.","2018-01-12 12:40:33","24","58","0.64","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/7pwbmq/100_renewables_100_impossible/","True","BeezelyBillyBub","1747885035.996248","renewables now","manual"

I saw this posted before, but it was months ago, and there were a lot of questions that were answered, but buried in the comments. I'll try to answer most of them here in one place.

So a full run down:

* For not additional cost to you, you can switch to using 50% clean energy (or 100% for a small premium($0.015) per kWh). [Plan Details](http://faq.arcadiapower.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-does-this-work-free-and-premium)

* They do this by purchasing [RECs](http://faq.arcadiapower.com/knowledge_base/topics/what-are-renewable-energy-certificates-recs) on your behalf. 

* They will get your bill from your electric company, and then bill you. It's all autopay, so if you are already using autopay then the switch will be invisible to you except for the company name at the top of your bill.

* You can get $25 on your next bill when you [use a referral link to sign up](https://www.arcadiapower.com/william5084). <-This is a link to my referral #shamelessplug. Or when someone you refer signs up. This is independent of what plan they sign up for.

Now, for a full disclaimer:

* You will need to provide them with the log in information for your utility company's website. I know this seems scary but, for what it's worth, trust me. I know you don't know me but I've been using them for almost a full year on the free plan and have had no problems. But don't take my word for it. [Here is their FAQ](http://faq.arcadiapower.com/knowledge_base/topics/is-my-information-secure-1) page about this. The are indeed [accredited by the BBB](https://www.bbb.org/washington-dc-eastern-pa/business-reviews/energy-service-company/arcadia-power-inc-in-washington-dc-236000288/bbb-accreditation). But for all that, I still recommend using a different password for your electric company than what you use for other things(which you should be doing anyway)

* The only option is auto pay, so if you are not comfortable with that, then this is not the choice for you

* If you are on the free plan they send you annoying emails every month or so trying to get you to sign up for the premium, but I think that it is possible to unsubscribe from it.

* There is a small $3 fee for using a credit or debit card, but that's the same thing your utility will charge you...or at least every utility that I've personally used.

**And that's it for downsides**
