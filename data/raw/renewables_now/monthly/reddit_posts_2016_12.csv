"5k8txw","collapse","skeptical","Our purpose as a species is to survive","A very long time ago, the Earth's atmosphere was mostly [carbon dioxide](http://teachertech.rice.edu/Participants/louviere/history.html). That's a pretty common composition for rocky planets; carbon dioxide is made by all sorts of things, while oxygen is a rarity. Oxygen doesn't tend to stick around, it's too reactive.

Then somewhere in the oceans of ancient Earth, life began. And eventually, one of the lifeforms produced, as a byproduct of devouring the resources in its environment as fuel for reproduction, oxygen.

We think of oxygen as this bountiful, life-giving substance that everything depends on. To the life forms of the time, it was poison. And wherever these oxygen-producing life forms spread, they started wiping out patches of living things. Until there were too many creatures producing oxygen, and the planet reached a tipping point, and everything that was dependent on the carbon dioxide atmosphere [died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event).

The atmospheric composition fluctuated from there, with oxygen and CO2 levels rising and falling depending on how well plants and algae were doing. Because they are, as they always have been, the only real source of oxygen on the planet. Plants give out oxygen, and animals breathe it in and give off the planet's own default atmospheric waste product, carbon dioxide.

And then we came along and started playing with fire. Fire eats oxygen in bulk and turns it back into carbon dioxide, among other things. In normal quantities, fire was integrated into the oxygen/CO2 balance sheet; wildfires and routine vulcanism were part of the equilibrium.

It turns out that even a few hundred thousand people farming and clearing land and cooking and doing all the things early humans used fire for had already [started changing the environment](https://theconversation.com/how-aboriginal-burning-changed-australias-climate-4454). The end of the ecological balance that we depend on has always been built into our ability to change our environment. We're very dependent on a stable environment, but changing our environment was the survival tactic that allowed us to thrive. 

There are those who believe that this is a condemnation of civilization, and intelligence itself. We should have remained animals, they reason; then we'd never be in this mess.

But without our ability to change our environment, we'd already be extinct. Our species was down to [ten thousand individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory) or less at one or more points in history; it was our ability to adapt by modifying our environment that allowed us to survive when other species perished. Without our abilities, without tools and fire, we'd have been extinct long ago.

This intelligence, this ability to carve the world into different shapes, to make things with fire, has not been wasted. We've used it to build shelters which keep our children and parents safe from the elements, and to provide nourishment. We have used it to explore the universe around ourselves, to delve into physics and astronomy and mathematics and chemistry and biology, to understand ourselves and our world. We've cured diseases, treated illness, ameliorated disabilities. We made music. We made art.

Mostly, though, we learned to communicate. We're these little bubbles of matter who are aware that they're bubbles of matter, and we really like talking about how amazing and weird that is. From gestures to speaking to writing to virtual reality, we keep finding new ways to show each other what the universe looks like from our own perspective. We keep inventing new ways to understand each other.

Now that we're facing a new balance in our ecosystem, one that will render the surface of the planet uninhabitable to us, we're going to have to adapt again. We've developed a whole new set of tools since the last time the planet went haywire, and I think they'll be sufficient to keep a few of us alive through this next, much more serious population bottleneck. If we dig in, build shelters that will withstand the new elements, learn new ways to use energy, we might make it through again.

We're a species of animal that's evolving to survive extinction events.

It's our prime evolutionary imperative, and we're about to fulfill it brilliantly. If a handful of people, scattered in habitats across the world, can surive this apocalypse, we'll have done something that no other species could even conceive of. Anticipate, plan for, and put measures in place to assure our survival in an extinction-level event.

Every other species just rolls the dice and hopes their local habitat won't be too badly affected.

If there's anything we're built for, if our species has any purpose, it's this. This is what we're programmed for by billions of years of survival.

No matter how beautiful the creations of nature have been in the past, their struggles for survival have always been in vain. Something was always going to wipe them out eventually, and there was nothing they could do about it. 

Well now we know what's coming. The atmospheric equilibrium that we depend on is coming to an end. Other species understand this on an instinctive level, and are responding by moving northwards, by moving higher, moving deeper. Some have already gone extinct. A few will hopefully figure out ways to adapt as their environment changes.

It's time to do what we do best. Adapt and survive. Unfortunately, survival will be resource-intensive, in a world where resources are rapidly becoming scarce. I expect that only the wealthy and powerful will be able to put together the technologies, materials and land necessary to create sustainable self-contained habitats.

The need for them is becoming apparent. There are already places where the atmosphere isn't breathable for [days or weeks](http://time.com/4607605/china-beijing-pollution-smog-environment-video/) at a time. There are already weather phenomena which are [choking people to death](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/australia/melbourne-australia-thunderstorm-asthma-attacks.html). We depend on a very particular mix of atmospheric gases for our [intelligence](http://www.advancedsciencenews.com/co2-on-the-brain-and-the-brain-on-co2/) and our [survival](https://www.reddit.com/r/doomsdaycult/comments/5761nn/the_case_for_concern_regarding_carbon_dioxide/) as large mammals, and that mix has changed, and is continuing to change at an accelerating pace.

Hopefully, some of the wealthy and powerful have already figured this out. Hopefully some of the rapid advancement we've seen in renewable energy, materials science, botany, environmental engineering and so on recently will make this possible.

If enough of them figure it out and act fast, the species will continue. Given the nature of our survival instincts, odds are they will.

If the climate crisis takes long enough to unfold, hopefully the technologies they develop will propagate into the public sphere and come down in price, thus ensuring that more self-sufficient habitats spring up around the world. Additionally, some brave and creative souls will take it upon themselves to create their own arcologies; some already are.

For a time, humanity will huddle in our shelters, barely defended from the planet turned hostile outside. But as we get better at survival, as we learn how to live in our new environment, we'll come to the realization that we have learned that we can live anywhere. In surviving the death of our habitable atmosphere, we'll have come to the point where we no longer require terrestrial planets to survive. We'll have taken our survival into our own hands.

When we recover enough to start looking towards space again, we'll find the challenges of living on Mars, on Titan, in the asteroid belt, in space itself, a lot less intimidating than we do now. We'll be veterans of a hostile world, able to survive pretty much any extinction event the universe can throw at us.

Extinction is for animals. We've evolved to overcome it.

**Prologue**
We are overpopulated, our planet is warming, our soil is being destroyed, our antibiotics are ineffective, the ecosystems we rely on are in turmoil. Humanity and civilization now face a life-or-death fight on many fronts. I believe we will endure a traumatic and extraordinary decline. But I also believe we also have extraordinary power to help ourselves, both individually and collectively.
As we learn more, the news can seem very scary. Some days inevitably, you will just want to panic, or cry, or give up, or deny it all.
Instead, I would like to tread the middle road of realism – and you can too. No matter how bleak the future, there are reasons to remain calm and fight for the future. Here are fifty that I thought of. Some are facts, others are feelings. I hope one or two might help you in your darkest moments. 

**1.Panicking doesn’t help.**
Panicking people don’t change anything, and they don’t enjoy themselves either. Don’t condemn yourself to that kind of life, when you can live it well, and still be part of the change.

**2. Earth will not explode.**
I know it’s ridiculous, but let’s start our perspective at the worst nightmare and work down.

I saw a cartoon of an exploding Earth once in an online column. It was probably a joke, but I want to tell you the ground is not going anywhere. Earth will stay a beautiful planet, oceans and all, for a billion years yet – and that’s a long time. Sometimes, thinking about that deep future brings me calm.

**3. Earth won’t turn into Venus.**
Sometimes speaking about climate change, one compares Earth to Venus. Venus is hotter than an oven, has no liquid water, and nothing can live there. But Venus has an atmosphere ninety times heavier than Earth’s, made of almost pure CO2. That’s 90,000 times more CO2 than even a greenhouse Earth. So trust me, if you didn’t know, we can’t turn Earth into Venus.

We also can’t reach the irreversible “moist greenhouse” state that has been posited as a similar end to life on Earth – not even if we burn all the fossil fuels.

**4. Earth has been here before.**
We know Earth has dozens of mass extinctions in its history, most associated with catastrophic sudden climate change. The worst we know of was the Permian-Triassic boundary – a ten-degree warming triggered by CO2, no less – that killed about ninety percent of all life. These events were terrible, but they were no-one’s fault.

Don’t think we are even the first life on Earth to change the climate. We’re not that exceptionally terrible. We just stumbled on something we shouldn’t have.

**5. Earth’s life will carry on.**
After every catastrophe, Earth’s life slowly recovered. Life, even complex life, is incredibly tenacious; it will hang on to the last. The Anthropocene extinction will decimate Earth’s rich biodiversity, but through speciation it will one day recover.
Sometimes I think about what Earth will look like in fifty million years. Regardless of human actions, I imagine a lush and beautiful wilderness full of plants and animals: a few you might recognize, and others strange and new. None of them will know or care what we did. In this important way, we will be forgiven. 

**6. Humans are of the Earth.**
We tend to think of ourselves as separate from nature, but we are animals, a part of the ecosystem. We’re related by blood to all other animals. Every species has in common a certain selfishness, a genetically-implanted desire to grow and consume. It’s not unique to us, and we can’t turn it off.
In the same competition as all our animal peers, we used an unusual resource to excel. It is who we are, and it is what it is. 

**7. We started in an ice age.**
Earth has been ice-free for 85% of its history. Starting with an ice-free Earth, we would have had far less room to emit CO2 before reaching a very hostile climate. So, given that we were destined to discover a billion years’ worth of fossil fuels and start lighting them up, we evolved at a (relatively) suitable time to do it. Let’s be thankful for small mercies. 

**8. The worst climate terror is far away.**
The most nightmarish scenario of all is “oceanic eunixia”, in which bacteria in the oceans release hydrogen sulphide gas which poisons life on land and sea, It has contributed to mass extinctions before. But we will never see it, and our descendants probably won’t either. Eunixia has only ever happened when CO2 levels were consistently above 1000 parts per million, which we’re not projected to manage. Even then it is far from certain, and if it happens it may not be worldwide, and in any case it wouldn’t start for ten thousand years. Don’t waste your nightmares on such distant possibilities – focus on more proximate concerns. 

**9. Some humans will probably carry on.**
In any event except severe eunixia (or a large meteor), I believe humans will persist after our civilization collapses. Before civilization we were already one of the most widespread animals on Earth. Our ingenuity, adaptability and ability to eat just about anything leads us to adapt to every climate, hot and cold. We’ve even endured sharp changes of climate before. The ecosystems we destabilized will reel and transform for millennia to come, but if we cover everywhere still inhabitable, is it silly to suggest a hardy few will make it through the turmoil? 

**10. We might have prolonged Earth’s life.**
A little ""bad science"" argument: geological weathering processes and fallen plants have progressively sequestered the world’s carbon – the latter is why we have fossil fuels in the first place, of course. Millions of years from now, this caching process will eventually annihilate CO2, prevent photosynthesis, and possibly cause the end of much life. If we have delayed this process, think of all the extra generations of future plant and animal life we might have permitted – an ironic blessing to tomorrow’s life, to partner the curse we bestow on today’s. 

**11. Our animal companions will accompany us.**
After humans, the more likely mammals to survive include the ones we have partnered with. Our symbiotic friendships with dogs, cats and horses has lasted millennia, and you find them just about everywhere you find you find humans. Any surviving humans will probably continue to benefit from the service and companionship of these animals. Consider some distant descendants of ours, confronting a challenging world with the aid of a faithful working dog. 

**12. You won’t live through it all.**
The full equilibration of Earth’s climate to its new warm state will take hundreds of years, and so – God willing – will humanity’s fight to survive it. So as you hear about all the terrible predictions of what will or might happen, understand that you won’t have to see them all. 

**13. We know what’s happening.**
Our knowledge of the world, while sadly incomplete, is colossal. We know about our own climate forcing and nature’s many feedback loops. Our predictions of the crisis’ progression improve every day even as we enter it. The knowledge that terrifies you, also terrifies the powerful who must act to mitigate it. Knowledge is the force for good against ignorant capitalism.
Imagine the contrary: had we remained in ignorance, and rapidly burned all the world’s fossil fuel reserves without a clue of what we were doing, we would have had nothing to do but weep and blame an angry God. 

**14. We are doing much about it.**
Our eleventh-hour fight against our CO2 emissions, while predictably late, is still massive and commendable. Science has laid bare the consequences, and politicians have finally listened. You may find the policy changes meagre, but they matter and they will grow. Also, we can’t deny that we’ve had a pulse of innovation including efficient and cheap renewable energy, power reduction of appliances, electric cars, “sustainable” building materials, and so on. It’s not enough to stop the warming, but it’s not bad. 

**15. Engineers can optimize for anything.**
Engineers have always optimized their creations – for minimum weight on a plane, or minimum cost on a mass-produced object. Now for some time they have also been optimizing for reduced embodied CO2 in materials and processes, and the savings matter. Don’t believe the exaggerated greenwash, but know that we tried. 

**16. What we have built can help us.**
As we face civilizational decline and fight to kill emissions, the infrastructure we have built will make it easier. It’s hardly utopian, but for example, if we can maintain the internet for some time, we might communicate during the decline (say, about which plants will grow) without spending invaluable emissions on travel, which will save lives or make them more bearable.
 
**17. Renewable energy is reality.**
A huge renewable energy capacity is now being created worldwide. Some, like solar panels, are localized. It is some comfort to me that even survivors of an acute crisis may, at least initially, have some sources of useful energy other than the deadly fossil fuels. 
 
**18. There are (limited) means for us to sequester carbon.**
If the crisis spins us into enough panic to act, there may be a little artificial mediation of the effects – like harvesting biomass and sequestering its carbon. It’s no solution, but it allows some faint hope of us undoing some of the catastrophe before its full effects arrive. This is slowly becoming technologically and politically viable, so if you have any faith in technology, you might like to place some here. 

**19. Technology is a good unknown.**
In general, technology created our problems and it won’t solve them, but one can still hope that some late-stage innovations reduce the final total, or rate, of CO2 released. For example, the explosive growth of renewable energy has exceeded all expectations, and will allow us to shut off fossil fuel plants a little earlier, if we are willing. The remarkable pace of innovation will have at least some effect on the shape and size of our carbon pulse – I do hope it is to the good. 

**20. You’re probably in the global elite.**
Ordinary citizens can’t much affect the path of our leadership in this crisis, but you can try to navigate your own way through it all. If you are a middle-class professional in a rich country like the US or Europe, you are probably in the global 1%, so however badly your own life will be affected this century, I guarantee you, other poor souls will have it worse. In dark times, be grateful for your advantages. 

**21. Social change can be rapid.**
I am often depressed by the lack of public awareness and agitation against climate change in the US and UK –rendered docile by cynical leaders and manipulative media, many of us seem to have accepted the offer to plug our ears and walk into the fire. But in most other countries the public care, and attitude can swing here too when we get a big enough scare. We will all care about this, very soon. 

**22. There are reasons for nations to work together.**
We have reached this lamentable place, with so much warming already and so much more unavoidably to come, because nations could not overcome their differences and avert the tragedy of the commons. Now though, this seems to be changing – because every nation has everything to lose. Any leader who loves their own land more than they hate others, now concludes that even at a national level, the best path is to urgently cut emissions. 

**23. There are economic reasons to reduce emissions.**
In a capitalist system, a low-carbon economy emerges when low-carbon technologies are cheaper than the alternatives. This is now true for energy sources, and that market force is stronger than political hand-wringing. Market foresight means investment money will flow to energy and transport solutions that are reducing in price, and will be cheaper in the future. The more we deconstruct the carbon economy, the greater the incentives will be.

**24. It is worth changing your lifestyle.**
Become more sustainable in your food, energy and transport consumption. Your individual contribution may be negligible – every big helps – but it will prepare you for a future when we have no choice, and set a valuable example to others.

**25. This fight will bring us purpose.**
In the developed world we have few material complaints, but often feel that our lives lack meaning. There is a reason for this: we are programmed to relish struggle. Fighting for humanity’s survival is the greatest struggle of all. Make it your cause.
Believe it or not, we do have a future. You have a future. 

**26. Hardship brings us together.**
We may be headed for hard times, and that brings enemies – we may be pitted against each other, and we will certainly be less safe. But we will also form strong alliances and communities, out of necessity if nothing else. These alliances will be of a depth you’ve never known before. We will band together, and in our groups, we will help each other. 

**27. There will be helpers.**
Terrible tragedies will happen this century, on a scale we have never seen before – but as Mr Rogers once said, in ever tragedy, look for the helpers. Look for those kind souls who try to respond and make things better, even if for a moment. They are humanity’s best face, and they are always there in the background.
Better yet, when the opportunity comes, be one. 

**28. We can learn from the old.**
Talk to the old, who have experienced war, and didn’t grow up in our period of privilege and safety. They have many lessons for you about how to survive and stay sane under impossible circumstances. 

**29. We grew in ignorance, but we will decline with wisdom.**
We may face, as least for now, a seemingly interminable backward march along the road of history. But there is one difference. The knowledge we have built in this era is like the great library of Alexandria, a million times over. Yes, some of it will burn and be forgotten, but some of it will help us in our fight to survive.  

**30. We will break our addiction to progress.**
The Idea of Progress is an 18th Century European invention – broadly, that technology improves the human condition. Two staggering world wars using technology did not free us from the ridiculous mentality that we can master the Earth with progress. But in the coming decline, dealing with catastrophic climate change of our own making, that day must finally arrive – all the better for our survival. 

**31. We will set an example for the next generations.**
We will teach them about the inevitability of decline and adaptation, and about the need for efficiency, frugality, and good use of those little resources that remain. We’re the first generation for a while to really know about this, but our philosophical shift may set the moral tone for a long time to come. 

**32. You aren’t “stealing” our children’s resources.**
You didn’t choose to live at this strange and decadent time, at the peak of such an unsustainable and destructive globalized society. You were born into it, just as your ancestors were born into your era, and your children are born into theirs. Just live lightly and prepare them for a depleted and chaotic future – this is the best thing you can do for them.  

**33. This crisis was always going to happen.**
From the moment we found coal, we were destined to meet climate change. Its potential has always been there, waiting to be unleashed. If not fossil fuels, agricultural emissions alone might have done it. And, resources consumed being related to population, our climate crisis was destined to coincide with a (similarly inevitable) crisis of overpopulation.

You have been chosen by fate to witness the long-anticipated moment that humans confront this great double-headed beast. We will respond as well as we can.

**34. Some collapse is desirable.**
Our culture is decadent, corrupt, and revels in an illusion of abundance. It’s not healthy, and in the end it hasn’t even made us that happy.
My distant hope is that one day, on a strange and warmer world, some people will get a chance to build again and live well for a while – but with the memory of our past follies seared into their flesh and culture, so that they hesitate to repeat them, for a while at least. That vision may seem unimaginably out of reach, but one may cling to it nevertheless – you never know how people find a way. 

**35. Collapse panic is not realism.**
By all means prepare yourself for a societal collapse, but don’t assume the worst will happen – this mentality is not logical, and it leads to dangerous conclusions and self-destructive actions. The hard road of realism means agitating for the best option, preparing for the worst, and above all, responding to changes as they come, to keep yourself alive and in the game. 

**36. Unsustainable lifestyles must stop anyway.**
“Unsustainable” means it was never going to be sustained. It’s that simple. The end of unsustainable life is not pleasant, but it is right. I think the waste of our age is barbaric, and globalization has ultimately failed us.

(On the other hand, our global interdependence, the one thing standing between us and a complete tragedy of the commons scenario, is still here for now and very difficult to undo.)

**37. We’ll understand things again.**
I am rather sick of living in a world of incomprehensible man-made complexity – technological, political, economic. One thing is for sure – if we are forced into a simpler world, it will have its dangers, but it will be one that doesn’t vex our minds in this way. We will understand a little more of the processes that shape our lives. 

**38. Our happiness adjusts to our circumstances.**
As a pampered First World citizen, the transition to decline can seem unimaginably tragic and frightening – if it’s not literally the end of the world, the end of our lifestyles may as well be. But think: our ancestors’ lives were much simpler, humbler and more precarious, sometimes violent, and yet they did find moments of joy in them. Under all but the most hopeless and painful circumstances, humans prefer to be alive. Remember: the end of growth does not mean the end of all human happiness. Find those moment of joy in your own life, and treasure them. 

**39. Expectations adjust to our means.**
We drive our cars to work, even though we know it slowly destroys the atmosphere. We do so because we are expected to: by the boss, by the government, by our peers. In this simple way, the continued destruction of nature has been ratcheted up, even by citizens who don’t really want to. Our means are so great in this golden age, but society has expectations of us to match. In decline, both will be cut away together – you’re only expected to do what you can. 

**40. Scientists need to scare people.**
When climate scientists reveal scary findings, they must frame them in a scary way. It’s the right thing for them to do. They themselves are scared, and they want important people to listen.
The target audience for this fear-mongering is more them than you (although public awareness is the key to convincing them). Once again, always remember it’s not up to you to solve the world’s insoluble problems – you’ve only got to endure them. This lesser task is difficult enough. Don’t take on burdens that aren’t yours. Let world events take their course, and respond. 

**41. Politicians are what they are.**
Instead of despairing at the inaction of politicians, accept them for what they are: corrupt, arrogant and sefish. They care about your welfare only inasmuch as it keeps them in power. You’re clever enough to know that.

But know that sometimes your future prospects coincide with theirs, and this grave global challenge might just be one of those times.

**42. The media want you to panic.**
The media has always known that the best way to control behaviour is by appeal to emotions, and the strongest of all is fear. Fearful readers are more susceptible to the distractions the media provides, namely bovine consumption and ignorance. So the media write all their articles in a sensationalist way, no matter which political stripe. Be aware of the facts, but don’t binge on media – you only hurt yourself. You don’t have to go along with their game. 

**43. You are strong.**
You are strong enough to live in the “desert of the real”, to understand the terrible troubles of the world and face them bravely, while focusing on your own life and negotiating through them. You are a survivor. You are prepared. You are strong. 

**44. Everything has an upside.**
As awful as it sounds… some of the impossible crises we face can mitigate the others. A trade war, as awful as it would be, would greatly reduce trade volumes and hence global CO2 emissions, buying the human race valuable time to migrate and adapt to new climates. A pandemic, as awful as that would be, would reduce overpopulation. It’s the grimmest argument I’ve ever thought of for optimism, but there it is. 

**45. Merriment is a renewable resource.**
In the darkest, toughest times, force a smile. Force yourself to dance and sing, create a little merriment with your loved ones and friends. It’s free, emits no carbon, and keeps our hopes alive for one more day. 

**46. Life is too long anyway.**
I won’t sugarcoat it: Collapse, or end-stage decline, means our lives will be shorter. Diseases will return to haunt us, violence will be more common, nourishment will be uncertain, there may be little if any medicine.
But on the other hand, our lives now in the West are blighted in any case by the great pain of old age. People are kept alive to the point where they hardly enjoy it any more. 

**47. Everyone dies one day.**
In your life, the worst that can happen to you is that you suffer and die. As our population must eventually decrease, this is indeed certain to happen to many people. But you can’t avoid death anyway! Everyone dies. The only thing you have to lose is comfort. Smile at the absurdity of life, and continue on your way. 

**48. Success and doom are not the only two options.**
Between the unlikely best-case scenario (green tech miracles and population stabilization in the West lead to a period of sustainable comfort) and the unlikely worst case scenario (rapid collapse, war, famine) there are many hypothetical outcomes. I’m sure you’ve considered them all. Maybe collapse will be followed by some rebuilding, or maybe we will have a long but stable decline under austere, authoritarian but stable rule. In most scenarios, you get to live some kind of life.
Our history isn’t written yet. Don’t waste your life-energy writing it. 

**49. No single action will doom or save us.**
No single event – election, natural disaster, climate change discovery for better or worse, whatever – will act alone in determining our fate. It is shaped by longer trends. So don’t panic at each day’s news, even if it’s very bad. Larger, longer trends are what matters. 
And once again remember, there are 7 billion individual stories to be written, they’re not all the same, and yours is unlikely to be the worst. 

**50. We’re all in this together.**
Don’t face this alone. Everyone on Earth must face this awful future, and it’s on all of our minds. Share your pain with your loved ones, and share love and comfort each other. Be happy, whenever you can.  

---

**Epilogue**
The message of this post is not simply “stop thinking about climate change and overpopulation”. That would be silly: The rest of our lives will be dominated by this, it will touch everyone, some severely, some will die. It’s not your fault that you’re in this, but you can learn to accept it. Meld your fear with hope to make determination, resilience and resolve. Both individually and collectively, the more we think, act and prepare, the better we’ll do.

I’m ready. Let’s go.
