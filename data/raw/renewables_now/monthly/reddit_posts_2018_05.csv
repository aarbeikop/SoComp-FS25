We are under reporting emissions in 2 ways, fracking methane emissions, and by counting wood pellet burning as zero emissions.

Europe gets 50% of its renewable energy by shipping dead wood from all over the world and burning it. 

When you see headlines like Germany got all its electricity from renewable energy, 50% of that energy is from burning trees whose emissions are not counted. 

When you see a pie chart showing how much energy is renewable energy, half of the renewable energy slice is from burning trees.

When trees die they become incubators for insects, which attract birds. Take those trees away and you take away insects and birds.

Statistically, our emissions are declining only 1%/decade as part of our total energy use. In reality, our emissions are rising. This means renewable energy is more additive than subtractive as far as emissions go.

Fracking methane emissions are 4X higher than reported. This means that natural gas is just as dirty as coal. 

This non-reporting of actual emissions has profound and dire implications for future emissions scenarios. 

We have to reduce our emissions 100% in 20 years to avoid 2C.

After we reduce emissions to 0% we are told we have to take carbon out of the air using BECCS on a scale never seen before.

We need 1 billion acres of new land for BECCS to make a difference. We will barely be able to feed ourselves, let alone grow another billion acres of plants to burn.

We are lying about current emissions, and we are lying about future emissions because we can't deal with reality. We believe those lies because we want to.

Right now, the US deep state spends a trillion bucks per year defending oil security in the middle east. We burn brown women and children alive with hellfire missiles so that some Saudi asshole can live like a king. While we're busy kissing his ass, he's beheading a dozen people a week to keep his peace.

We sent all our manufacturing jobs to China, and we are going to send all our analytical jobs to the AI cloud. Some say half a billion jobs will go missing to AI worldwide over the next 30 years.

Our financial system is so fraudulent, it is indescribable and has been teetering on collapse since 2008. This can't go on forever.

While climate change is just 30 years of weather, our crops depend more on weather than climate, and water depends on weather.

In just over 10 years, humanity's water demand will exceed its supply by 40%.

It's Karl Marx's 200th birthday soon, and kids today don't understand how corruptible his ideals are. All our political ideals are totally corruptible. 

We've found that a black president is totally evil.

Women like Clinton, Albright, and Rice are totally evil.

There's no shortage of evil gay Republicans. Ellen Degeneres dancing with George Bush says it all. No. Oprah will not save us.

I'm not arguing against equality, I'm merely pointing out reality.

This is why I argue for wealth redistribution through 100% private carbon tax dividends, but most people don't care or even understand what that means.
