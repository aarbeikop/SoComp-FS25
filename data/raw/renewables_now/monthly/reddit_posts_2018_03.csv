"82e8lv","climate","scientific","The Terrible Truth","We must reduce our emissions 100% by 2040 to stay under 2 C.

But our emissions are projected to rise 16% by 2040.

And our energy use is projected to rise 30% by 2040.

Yet James Hansen says 2 C = Disaster.

Kevin Anderson says we have a 5% chance of staying under 2 C.

I believe we already have 0% chance of staying under 1.5 C.

2040 is 22 years away, yet world water demand will exceed world supply by 40% by 2030, in just 12 years.

World electric grid production is only 20% of total world energy demand.

It will several decades minimum to convert 100% of total world energy demand to renewable energy.

Europe gets 50% of its renewable electricity by burning wood.

James Hansen says that after 20 years of trying, solar and wind only make up 2% of total world energy demand.

You keep hearing we can have 100% renewable energy by 2050. This is a lie.

We will not have enough minerals, soil and water to do this.

In 2010 copper ore grades were 30 lbs/ton of ore.

In 2016 copper ore grades are 3 lbs/ton of ore.

By 2025 copper ore grades will be under 2 lbs/ton of ore.

No amount of money can change that.

A wind turbine uses 100 times more copper per unit of energy than fossil fuels .

An offshore wind turbine uses 1,000 times more copper per unit of energy than fossil fuels. They are also exposed to super storms.

All the solar panels and wind turbines you see now will have to be replaced in 30 years, but it takes 70 years to change society over to 100% renewable energy. Renewable energy has to be replaced 2 times faster than it takes to convert the whole world over.

We will always have essential minerals, but not at cheap enough prices. When ore grades go down and energy costs go up, society collapses.

We are losing soil to degradation and erosion so fast that human agriculture is projected to end in 60 years.

We have to grow more food between now and 2050, than in all of human history to feed people the way they eat now.

To this we need 12 million acres of new soil per year for 30 years.

But we are losing 24 million acres of soil per year to degradation and erosion. We are losing soil 2 times faster than we need to find new soil.

Within 1-10 years the world economy will crash.

Deep down you know all this to be true.

"83659p","climate","scientific","The Global Collapse of 120 Solar Companies Was Self-Inflicted, And Now Winter Is Coming","In the year 2000, Germany and America owned 90% of solar power.

In the year 2018, Asia owns 80% of solar power.

Solar power is smashing into the debt wall, 

It's gonna be ugly, and it's gonna hurt like hell.

Highlights:

The global renewable sector refinancing needs in the next 7-8 years is worth more than its entire market capitalization (134 billion euros). They want to borrow more than they're worth exactly when loan costs go up.

Bankruptcies such as SolarWorld, ET Solar, American Solar, SunEdison, Sungevity, Suniva, Beamreach, Verengo Solar and others did not happen due to lack of support or technology, but due to a debt bubble business model. Debt = Greed.

Bankruptcies in the solar sector exceed all those of coal and fracking companies combined. 

Solar power did this by basing theie business on ever-increasing subsidies, and higher prices, and financing it with suicidal debt.  A model whose sole objective was to install for the sake of installing capacity no matter what it costs. Even in a period of falling interest rates and very high liquidity, there have been spectacular bankruptcies, so imagine what can happen when rates rise.

Don't forget, the future of humanity is supposed to be riding on these guys, and their companies are just about bankrupt, but at least the owners will have squirreled money away in tax havens.

We based the future of the planet on solar greed and lies.

All human emissions must go down 100% in 20 years to save earth.

It will take that long for solar companies to recover from the coming shakedown.

Solar power is now equal to 1.0% of the world's total energy demand.

"867z3b","sustainability","action-oriented","How To END Pollution","The biggest obstacle to sustainability is overcoming our unconscious resentment of money. Let me explain. 

I’m sure we can all agree that we resent money hungry big businesses because they consume our natural resources just so they can make a quick buck. But when we reflect upon our own actions, occasionally we resent making money because we consumed the most precious resource for it, our time.  Now, the process of evolution has trained us to attack anything that consumes our time because at an unconscious level we feel like our very survival is under threat. So today, that means we instinctively react by destroying money, as making it consumed our time, but this is a huge problem because of 2 reasons; money isn’t attacking us and money is the most universal and most efficient system of trust ever devised. When we consume money, we destroy trust and without trust we aren’t able to cooperate and build a sustainable future. 

The reality is, we have defeated the survival of the fittest problem and our very desire to survive is now working against us. Life is tough and life’s goal is to create more life. And so far as we know, no other life has made it to such a highly evolved state before, where it is conscious enough to be aware of it’s own consciousness. 
Here are some facts to consider;
•	Homo sapiens are jus one of at least 30 billion different species of organism to have lived on earth.
•	More than 99.99% of any species to ever have existed is extinct. 
•	Our species spread around the globe 70,000 years ago thanks to our first major revolution, the cognitive revolution.
•	The next revolution, the agricultural revolution, enabled our population to grow rapidly.
•	The scientific revolution enabled our growth to explode. 
•	If we scale planet earth’s existence down to one single day, our 70,000-year domination is represented by less than 1 second.  
•	We are in a revolution now. 

Everybody knows it already. We feel like we are on the edge of leaping into space, giving birth to AI, becoming more conscious of our actions, or plunging down into chaos, into destruction, into disorder. 

We have created incredible tools to help us trust each other. We can both use them and keep making them better to find our solution, or we can be part of the problem. 

Since we live in a capitalist/consumerist world, our most important tool right now is money because it is what we use to represent trust. Here is a 4-step process that you can follow that will help you become more conscious of appreciating money and if you follow this correctly, your wealth must increase.

1.	Awareness
Begin by paying more attention to the things that you buy that you grow to resent. Resentment is the feeling that comes from being consumed, from unsustainability. This changes for everyone and there is no generic answer. It could be a yearlong gym membership, an expensive wine, a holiday, petrol or tomatoes wrapped in plastic. 

2.	Acceptance
It doesn’t really matter why you resent that purchase, but you do need to accept that it unconsciously makes you loose trust in others and it makes you angry. You feel that way because you traded your limited resource, time, for money and now spend your money on something that you don’t appreciate. The problem is, you don’t know how to find ways to use money on things that appreciate, so you can build trust in others.

3.	Alignment
Many people today resent one time use plastic and so do everything they can to avoid it, but sometimes still can’t. But what if you knew of people that were engineering a solution out of plastic? Perhaps it is an alternative that is made from renewable resources and is biodegradable? Or maybe it’s an organisational system that makes it easier to reuse an existing container than consume a new one? Whatever the solution, if you can develop trust in it, you have found alignment. You have found a version of the solution you are excited by.  

4.	Action
Once you’ve found someone that can reliably create results, by taking action and investing in them, you create trust. If the people you trust are indeed trustworthy, you will get feedback, the money you invested in them must appreciate. The consequence is a miracle, you help create a future you love and your wealth increases. You are rewarded because you have taken ownership of creating a better future by trusting and cooperating with other passionate change makers like yourself.  

The best-case example for sustainable living isn’t a tree hugging hippie, but Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of our era. He takes out the top spot because over his life so far he has donated some $30bn to charities. Starting from scratch, he now is valued at $90bn. Now, he doesn’t have that money sitting in his bank, it is all invested in businesses that he values, ones that are creating the solutions the world needs. But what makes him a real super human is; despite his unfathomable wealth, he still lives frugally. He lives in the first house he ever bought which is valued at less than $300k, drives the same car for decades and spends less than $4 on his breakfast. Buffett doesn’t spend his money on things that he doesn’t appreciate; he invests it all so that it does appreciate. 

Creating sustainability today requires nothing more than consciously appreciating your money. 

The first two steps I just described are extremely important because they will lead you to a place where you can start to make change. They will lead you to forgive others that have betrayed your trust by taking your money, your time. They will also help you become more conscious of spending your money only on things that you trust will create a better future for yourself and others. It is a constant challenge. 

The next step is to invest, but sadly you’ve probably already tried that and now feel resentful about having tried because you lost your money. So before ever investing again, you owe it to yourself to find out how wealthy people like Warren Buffett can invest every year and never loose. If it’s humanly possible, consider it within your reach. 

I’ve got a few starting points and will be glad to share them here if people find this article useful. Leaves some comments and I’ll provide examples of sustainable, conscious businesses, that if you had invested in, would have created you additional wealth. 

Let’s shift forward together
