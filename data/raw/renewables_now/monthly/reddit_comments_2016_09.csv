Although why worry anyways, it's all natural, you know? Nothing's wrong at all. There's no law in the universe that says no one should suffer because they're so damn stupid. But i must honestly say that i'm sorry, because it's just a shame and a terrible loss, that we have everything we need to enjoy life, yet we choose not to.","2016-09-15 22:59:47","5","[deleted]","1747860156.25035","renewables now","manual"
"d7op07h","t3_52yvvv","52yvvv","collapse","skeptical","So many ways to approach this. In more immediate terms, November of 1980 was about it for us. President Jimmy Carter was quite ineffective--not liberal enough for the Ted Kennedy wing of the Democratic party, but too liberal for the then non-troglodytic Republican party. Unwilling to sacrifice the hostages in Iran with a massive slaughter of innocent, hapless Iranian citizens; Carter appeared weak and wishy-washy on foreign policy, and unfortunately for the blood-lusty among us, did not get the hostages killed. 

To top everything off, the best speech Carter ever delivered, the so-called ""malaise speech,"" was much hated by the American people (especially after being told what to think by the so-called liberal media of the time). In that address to the nation, Carter did what American presidents have unfailingly avoided since that night--he leveled with the American people, and spoke to us as if we were adults. To return the favor, we elected Ronald Reagan in a landslide when he told us babies what we wanted to hear. Reagan did not disappoint us imbicles; one of his first public actions as president was to rip the solar panels off of the White House roof.","2016-09-16 01:58:46","4","AngusScrimm---------","1747860156.2550662","renewables now","manual"
