---------------------------------------------------------------
Contrary to what you are repeatedly told, civilization will collapse long before we can effect a 100% renewable energy transition as short-term water, food and energy shortages ignite the collapse of civilization.

What It Means
----------------

Survival is based on low-emissions energy and our survival is not like perusing an energy menu of options we like or dislike.

REALITY

It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6 solar panels.

Electricity production is only 18% of total world energy use.

82% of total world energy use is not electrical generation.

After 20 years, solar-wind energy production is up from 1% to 3% of total world energy use.

Solar-wind power are projected to provide 6% of total energy use by 2030.

It takes 10X as much solar-wind energy to close 1 fossil fuel power plant.

It will take 10 X 18% of total world energy use to close all fossil power plants.

And, it will take 4 X 82% of total world energy use for a 100% wind-solar energy transition.

These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid infrastructure.

Such infrastructure is hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades and additional trillions of dollars.

Solar-wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have to do it all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil sources.

We have to stop carbon emissions at source within current infrastructure constraints at all costs period, exclamation mark. Then we will all have to learn to grow food because...

We will lock-in 2 degree temperature rise in 3 years for 2036 with BAU.

In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.

In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the British Foreign Office.

In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says Scientific American.

In 30 years we won't have enough fossil fuel for a 100% renewable energy transition.

Without massive energy demand destruction renewable energy is unsustainable.

Animal agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we can effect a 100% intermittent energy transition.

Without using Hansen's tax dividends to carbon tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die.

Instead of moving aspirational targets every 5 years, we have to move now, or forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation.

We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 60% of your carbon tax money. This is direct opposition to Hansen's plan and immoral. I strongly believe it should be in a new world e-currency directly deposited to your phone.

We have to close down ranches to reconstruct wildlife corridors, we can't let ranchers take over conservation areas and kill off life.

Top Ten Things You Need To Know
------------------------------

1) You don't need to know ten things.

2) Renewable energy is unsustainable without massive energy demand destruction.

3) Eating meat will destroy our soil and water before we can effect a 100% renewable energy transition.

4) We have no comprehensive, viable, realistic plan to survive this century. We cannot reduce emissions AND have economic growth as you are constantly told.

5) You are being lied to in a very big way, things can go to hell even faster than that because over the next year the pulse of heat from the oceans will initialize a planetary state jump into a new heat energy balance. Arctic methane will heat up the arctic jet stream further to wreak more worldwide havoc for crops. Most of our mega-cities and coastal croplands lie in sacrifice zones where most of the storm and flood damage are due to happen. Think rice paddies in low-land Asia where up to 50% of rice croplands are threatened and where 50% of humanity depend on rice to live.

5) Mega-cities are expected to burst at the seams very quickly as the world's young flee to them. By 2050 80% of humanity will be in cities where 75% of the infra-structure they require does not even exist. And we don't even bother to fix the infrastructure we got now. Putting trillions of dollars worth of flimsy renewable energy infrastructure in places like Dhaka Bangladesh or Miami Florida is a massive misallocation of resources in the new age of Super-Typhoons and Extreme Hurricanes. Renewable energy cannot be brought back on-line after storm damage as quickly as centralized power.
