"dbx4b4h","t3_5lnvm5","5lnvm5","environment","emotional","Very interesting post, thanks! I think there is another side to this though, and that is accepting that the climate IS changing, regardless of cause. Once that fact has been fully realised we can focus on dealing with the consequences of the changing climate. It will have some drastic effects on food, water and job security throughout the world leading to further exacerbating the migration ""crises"" and fuelling conflict throughout the world. If w put even 1% of the global defence budget into addressing the technical and sociological challenges of a changing climate we would do well to alleviate some of the potential problems.","2017-01-02 22:28:24","2","BKatarn","1747865614.458668","renewables now","manual"
"dbx8vbn","t3_5lnvm5","5lnvm5","environment","emotional","To add onto this, renewable energy **innovation**.

Because probably the only way renewables are going to catch on faster is by making them better/cheaper/etc.  Because something being a logical decision based on environmental preservation isn't going to go very far unless it's also a logical decision based on non-environmental factors.","2017-01-03 00:09:51","2","flamingtoastjpn","1747865614.4622028","renewables now","manual"
"dbxpl0z","t3_5lnvm5","5lnvm5","environment","emotional","I like your approach in the last paragraph. Make it fun. It will be THE biggest struggle we've ever faced ( autocorrect had put in ""aced "", instead of faced, a good mistake in this sentence don't you think?) . Yes, it's all scarey and most ppl have that cognitive dosonnance thing when you tell them what's going down, They just shut down...like a deer in the headlights. Somehow we've got to get beyond the fear, even tho it's the ultimate battle; to save the only planet we have. The only way is to overcome this aspect of humanity. How can we do that? It's like there are two different sorts of ppl put there. Look at any situation...some murderer on a train a few months ago. It was only a couple of guys who overcame it and went for them. The rest cowered. ( if. Remember the story right) but it's how we humans are put together...to cower. I think of the monkeys in the trees when the apes or bigger carnivorous ones are coming to get them. How they scream and panic...that's us right now. The big debate on if it's real or not. It's the human version of that. 
One thing waaay under the radar is the fact that the oceans are most likely to be very very different in fifty years or so. All the corals will be dead. Maybe some deep water ones will survive, who knows. And with the corals, most fish will go too. The increasing acidic water won't let much life but bacteria jellyfish and algae.( Google ""extra ocean heat now unstoppable""). When ppl start to realize the ramifications there will be a lot more panic. Our own govt predicts the breakdown of society from the coming changes. So...how to overcome the fear, and move quickly...post haste, towards a future where we can survive, maybe even replant forests, genetically modify organisms to survive hot acidic oceans...I don't know. We are a creative species. We might even figure out a way to refreeze. The Arctic if we could remove enough co2. I see us needing a global think tank, like the style of effort in WWII. Everybody involved ...maybe a Reddit upvotes system to bring the best ideas to the top? Implement changes fast. I always wondered why it had to be so slow. Why not put a gas tax of a nickel on it now. Increase it by $.05 every month or two...till we were weaned. Put a price on co2 to recapture it. Innovators will bring it online if theres a profit. The technology is there, but the only market for CO2 now is soda pop plants. ( and fracking! Ug). Anyway...I'm rambling, but I like your approach.

"dbxqzp2","t3_5lnvm5","5lnvm5","environment","emotional","As a sceptic I'd say you're sort of on the right track. The genie is out of the bottle on alarmist science, so there's no way to convince with that, but there are other ways to get people off fossil fuels:

Offer something better.

Not something that you can't store like Solar and Wind. What's the point of that? It has to be reliable. Modular nuclear is a good option. Promote fuel security - ""why buy oil from ISIS?"" ""Buy American electricity from fracked oil"". That sort of thing.","2017-01-03 07:53:06","1","AuLaVache2","1747865614.47227","renewables now","manual"
