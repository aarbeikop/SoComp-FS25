"e4te0i2","t3_9a7j8g","9a7j8g","collapse","skeptical","Yeah, it comes down to energy requirements.

For CO2 scrubbing (artificial) to be useful, the *entire process* needs to emit less carbon dioxide than it can capture.

Energy wise, this means using a source of power that can generate more than 400kj of energy for every mol of carbon dioxide released (even the ""cleanest"" of natural gas is only ~ 390kj/mol CO2). Then it would need to play catchup to capture all of the CO2 emissions caused by the producing of each piece of equipment used, from the scrubber to the power supply + transportation and carbon used by the manpower to build and maintain the system. ONLY THEN do we start to look at having actual negative emissions. It's a joke, really.

BECCS isn't any better due to land use and processing issues. The energy required to sequester the carbon is rediculous on its own, not to mention how much energy it would cost to process that much organic material.

"e4tfk58","t3_9a7j8g","9a7j8g","collapse","skeptical","Consider a simple back-of-the-envelope thought experiment; You have a magic wand. Abracadabra and the worlds power plants, engines and turbines all run in reverse. That is they suck CO2 down the chimney and train coal back to the mine. Or suck exhaust up the pipe and pump oil into the well.

Given that we have this magic wand - an amazing techno wizard breakthrough to be sure - how long would it take to suck the CO2 out the atmosphere? and how much would it cost?

It would cost roughly [10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_intensity) of the worlds GDP and take about [150](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) years. 

But worse of all it would be an energy *sink* rather than an energy *source*. When Shell builds an oil rig they get back 10x-100x fold the energy it took to build, its energy positive. With our wizard technology the energy cost of the infrastructure is lost, it's energy negative. Energy to run this machine *and the rest of the economy* would have to be generated by renewables. So it's not possible, even with a magic wand. Sorry.

OK, fine, we achieve global woowoo consciousness and do it. Turns out the planet can support maybe a couple billion like that, and not in cities at all. So also, almost 3/4s of us have to agree to just die.

I mean, sure, even 5% random population loss is enough to destroy our entire capacity to generate electricity, but don't worry about that. How are you going to pick 6Bn to suicide? What are you even going to do with the bodies?

There's no going back (EDIT:""without"") killing most of us and giving up electricity.

"e4ttj7m","t3_9a7j8g","9a7j8g","collapse","skeptical","There's lots of other problems out there, economic, population, other damage to the environment, but this one point about CCS is always the one I come back to, because even if we solved the rest, the problem of carbon in the air isn't going away, and will continue to get worse, with or without our help. It's the elephant in the room, and the doors are too small to get it out.

One thing on your list. #5 is too simple and short. I even missed it and was going to say you didn't mention sequestering, the problems and energy cost and emissions, until I reread to make sure.

Outside of the problem of scale, what to do with the carbon/CO2 captured is where every technique I've seen breaks. Many end up selling the CO2 back as compressed gas to be used in various ways, so it's not a permanent capture. Others turn it into a fuel form, which is great for a net zero emission/non-fossil source fuel, but again, not solving the real problem of removal.

I think /u/Answer_Evaded 's thought experiment is a simple but perfect display of the problem. And if you add to it a reversal of the extraction of the fossil fuels as well, then you see the true energy cost, just to undo the damage. Is such a scifi energy source even possible to power just all that?","2018-08-25 20:45:40","3","Rhaedas","1747896453.124651","renewables now","manual"

2. Our results suggest that as CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, the full warming effect of an emission may not be felt for several decades, if not centuries. Most of the warming, however, will emerge relatively quickly, implying that CO2 emission cuts will not only benefit subsequent generations but also the generation
