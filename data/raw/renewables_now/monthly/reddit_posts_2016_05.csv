"4jfxvc","sustainability","action-oriented","What are the significant challenges faced for the implementation of renewable energies?","and what social/political issues are they regarding the implementation of green technology/renewables from a UK prospective? 

I understand the need to do this, is to meet the aims of COP21-Paris agreement and move to the a decarbonised energy generation system by 2050. However, what are the stumbling blocks faced? 

At the forefront of my mind, David Cameron has slashed renewables incentives which has killed solar installation companies etc and basically made a mockery of the aims set at the COP21. I just can't see progress being made, if the agreement is non-punishable. Any other thoughts and opinions? So how are we going to move forward before the target of 2050, if the current government doesn't secure investment and make plans for the future now?

Likewise, could anyone suggest any background reading on this topic. Thanks!","2016-05-15 12:44:30","4","6","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/4jfxvc/what_are_the_significant_challenges_faced_for_the/","True","christopherlightfoot","1747851396.881068","renewables now","manual"
