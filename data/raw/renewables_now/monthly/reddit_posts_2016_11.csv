"5byi0k","environment","emotional","Let's get Trump to accept climate change","Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.","2016-11-09 04:45:05","22232","924","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/","True","cam_man_can","1747862396.740692","renewables now","manual"
"5cmbt6","environment","emotional","Debunking the feasibility and environmentalism of nuclear energy.","Nuclear power is an economic disaster before we even discuss the environmental impacts. When compared to coal and fossil fuels, nuclear power only becomes relatively competitive when government subsidies and the costs of decommissioning them are included in their costs of construction and operation. This is why no private corporation will touch nuclear unless granted iron-clad guarantees they will not be held responsible for any accidents or the costs of decommissioning, alongside very generous subsidies for their costs before and during their operation. Economists reported to CitiBank in a dossier entitled ""New Nuclear- the Economics say No"" that ""the risks faced by developers are so large and variable that individually they could bring the largest utility company to its knees financially."" That was the actual verbiage used. To their knees. The three most important risks cited by the report were construction, power price, and operational costs, i.e. essentially the entire project. They went as far as labeling these risks ""the corporate killers."" Once again a direct quote. A 2009 proposal from the nuclear industry outlined just what they would need: a $100 billion dollar boost (from an already $50 billion dollar loan guarantee) to the loan guarantee program, an extension of the production tax credits to for new reactors through 2025, the removal of the 6000 megawatt limit for the credit, a 30 percent investment tax credit or a grant in lieu of the tax credit, credits for new and expanding worker training programs, and the reduction or elimination of tariffs on nuclear components in many situations.
A study conducted by economist Mark Cooper of the Vermont Law School calculated the cost of adding 100 nuclear plants to the US power grid. The cost to the taxpayer OVER THE AMOUNT IT WOULD COST IF RENEWABLE AND ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES WERE INSTITUTED INSTEAD is 1.9-4.1 TRILLION DOLLARS over the reactor lifetimes. This analysis factored in studies from Wall Street that estimated costs of renewable energy at 6 cents per kilowatt-hour versus the 12 to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour of nuclear. These inefficiencies will only be recouped through subsidy which is nothing to say of the safety concerns.

An MIT report cited still significant safety and waste management concerns on top of cost inefficacy. There has yet to be a serious proposal of what to do with waste from nuclear. 36,000 tons of nuclear waste are piling up besides US reactors alone. The most highly radioactive waste must be sealed in storage for at least 10,000 years. Storage facilities longevity only needs to match the length of time advanced human society has been a thing. The reactors first commissioned 30 years ago are now nearing the end of their lifespans and the costs of entombing the reactors in concrete is extensive. The proposal of new generation IV reactors could remedy some of these safety concerns. However, they will not be feasible for another decade at the earliest and even so have been extensively critiqued by a 2009 report by Amory Lovins that they are not economically or environmentally sound. Also only generation III reactors are scheduled to be built currently. Olkiuloto 3 in Finland is still under construction after 12 years and the AREVA energy group was so inept they were broken up by the French government leaving concerns of who will bear the economic and financial responsibilities for its completion 12 years after construction began and 7 years after completion was scheduled.

The carbon neutrality of nuclear power is also a myth. To directly quote one report ""the use of nuclear power causes, at the end of the road and under the most favorable conditions, approximately one third as much carbon dioxide emission as gas-fired electricity production. The rich uranium ores required to achieve this reduction are, however, so limited that if the entire present world electricity demand were to be provided by nuclear power, these ores would be exhausted in 9 years. Use of the remaining poorer ores in nuclear reactors would produce more CO2 emission than burning fossil fuels directly.""

The mining and refinement of uranium is highly pollutant and energy intensive. The fissile material needed is only .7% of uranium ore. More than 99% of the mined material is left behind as highly toxic tailings containing over a dozen radioactive materials. A facility in Jaduguda, India processes more than 1000 tons of ore per DAY and generate 200 tons of uranium per YEAR from an original 350,000 tons of rocks that were mined. The containment entails pumping this waste into massive dams containing millions of tons radioactive waste. Of Indians living within one kilometer of a tailing dam 47% of women had menstrual problems, 18 percent had suffered miscarriages or stillborn, and 30 percent had fertility issues. Many of the children that survive have ""deformitites, skeletal distortions, partly deformed skulls and organs.""
Uranium extraction from seawater has not been proven commercially viable either. Breeder and thorium reactors are have also been proven economically inviable.

As the need for climate change solutions is immediate, nuclear power is a non-starter. Leaving aside planning permission and regulatory hurdles, nuclear reactors take at least 5 years to come on line with the potential for even longer delays as evidenced in Finland. Wind in comparison takes 18 months. Just to offset the closing of nuclear plants over the next 50 years and increase the percentage of global nuclear eneregy would require 21 to 25 large nuclear reactors (1 gigawatt capacity) new reactors be built every year for 50 years. Not to mention the bottlenecks of rapid construction not the least of which is the lack of highly skilled and trained nuclear personnel for construction, engineering and operations.
The International Atomic Energy Agency even recognizes the inefficacy of nuclear in combatting climate control in a report. Another direct quote, ""Nuclear power is not a near-term solution to the challenge of climate change. The need to immediately and dramatically reduce carbon emissions calls for approaches that can be implemented more quickly than building nuclear reactors. It also calls for actions that span all energy applications, not just electricity. Improved efficiency in residential and commercial buildings, industry, and transport is the first choice among all options in virtually all analyses of the problem."" Once again a direct quote from the International Atomic Energy Agency.","2016-11-12 20:38:56","14","17","0.66","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5cmbt6/debunking_the_feasibility_and_environmentalism_of/","True","Loves_His_Bong","1747862418.744719","renewables now","manual"
"5emjel","collapse","skeptical","Modern system is too robust and too stable for a fast collapse - instead a jenga-style downsizing will occur","Modern system is almost murderously efficient.

The split-nanosecond nature of the financial industry has permeated into every step of human endeavor, and the world has gotten too efficient to be destablized by a less-foreseen event, because solutions to counter it, or at least 'manage' it, can be found very quickly for virtually all problems.

The cheap oil is gone, but economy will readjust to embrace those who can afford the expensive oil, with some sprinkling of renewable energy, and will drop those who can't afford them.

The can can be kicked farther and farther until we reach the technical point which will completely change the nature of game, and most importantly,

Debt can increase at least 10 times from where we stand now, because the slack has been so great.

One by one, the periphery will be abandoned, and elites in these regions will move to the 'core' areas where civilization will continue.

And, the 'slack' civilization can absorb without collapsing is surprisingly large, thanks to a lot of redundancy planning done earlier in anticipation of nuclear war.

I think that by merciless triaging and ultra-draconian control in the Core, collapse can be averted until 2075 or so in the 'core area'.

Constantinople lasted for 1,000 years, Venice lasted from early Middle Ages till Napoleon, and San Marino , founded in 257 CE, never fell and survived Mussolini and World War 2 (although it did behave well enough to not draw the ire of the fascists and the allies).

It won't be pretty, but mankind is very adaptable and can be very ruthless when their own skin is at stake, so it will probably be the course civilization will take.
