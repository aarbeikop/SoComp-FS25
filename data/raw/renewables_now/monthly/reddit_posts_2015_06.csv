"39yuyn","climate","scientific","Let's do Paris before the COPS arrive","I propose that we crowd source a climate change agreement on reddit rather than leaving it to a bunch of stodgy old bureaucrats later this year. Anything and everything should be on the table to start. I'll propose some categories and make a proposal to get the ball rolling.

**Types of Emissions:** There are several kinds of emissions: Historical, future, per capita, and consumption versus production to name a few. I won't insult readers of r/climate by defining them here but at some point precise definitions might become necessary. For example consumption emissions might be defined as:

total emissions - exported emissions + imported emissions

It's also possible to combine categories, for example per capita historical emissions could conceivably be important to somebody.

**Budget:** I assume (and I won't say this again but nothing I say here is meant to be etched in stone) each country will be left with a future carbon budget after the negotiations are complete. The first order of business would seem to be an overall budget, which can then be divvied up between countries. Does anyone still think a 2C target is reachable based on IPCC numbers? 

The 1000 gigatons (Gt) of total carbon emissions number gets thrown out a lot as giving us some chance of a 2C target maximum temperature rise. That may not include carbon equivalents for stuff like NO2 and multipliers on methane and CFCs, but it's a round number, which is nice. We might have to agree to some reforestation or afforestation if we start with that number. 

We've already emitted about 550 Gt so we're left with about 450 Gt under that scenario. That also equates to about 1650 CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). Take away the 150 Gt CO2e due to be released as methane and we're once again left with a round 1500 Gt CO2 equivalents.

[Others might argue that's too generous by half](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/10/carbon-briefing-making-sense-of-the-ipcc%E2%80%99s-new-carbon-budget/), and I look forward to input on the matter. In my opinion choosing numbers that are unrealistically low does not serve us well in the long run.

**Other types of mitigation:** I mentioned growing trees. Is it wise to include some expectation of CCS by other means? It seems like we might get there for point-of-release emissions although on what scale I do not know and am dubious.

**Accountability:** One of the shameful legacies of the Copenhagen accords brought about by a few bad actors was the idea that compliance should be voluntary. It seems to me that we're going to have to have some sort of international monitoring and even fines, perhaps to be paid into:

**International Green Climate Fund:** Or whatever it's called to help developing countries develop renewable energy (and nuclear?). I think the amount paid into this fund should be heavily related to historical emissions. This could also be funded by a worldwide carbon tax, which would put the onus on future emitters. Perhaps a combination?

**My proposal:** In terms of future carbon budgets, how about if we neglect historical emissions and even consumption emissions and just base each country's budget on equal per capita emissions? 

Going forward, every man, woman, and child is allowed the same amount of emissions.

At first blush this may seem like a raw deal for developing countries that are not responsible for historical emissions. However, when you start looking at the numbers it seems like the best they can hope for. According to the numbers above and my error-prone calculations, that's about 200 tons of CO2e emissions per person from now until eternity. Countries can decide for themselves how that's spread between individuals and future generations as seems inevitable regardless of how the budgets are allocated.

[You can get a rough idea of how long a budget would last in a given country by dividing 200 by these numbers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita) 

Obviously it's going to be most difficult for countries with the highest per capita emissions such as Australia, The USA, and Canada. It's about 8 years of emissions for these countries at current rates, more if they start cutting back. Under a cap and trade system they could conceivably buy carbon credits from developing countries or perhaps build solar installations in these countries in exchange for carbon credits.

China would have about 30 years of emissions at current rates, but given current trends would have to peak or at least seriously level off before their announced 2030 target. European countries, Japan and others would fall in between these two. 

At current rates, third world countries would have until the end of the century and beyond to give up fossil fuels but would also have plenty of room to increase consumption in the short term and then transition to renewables.","2015-06-15 22:17:25","1","0","0.54","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/39yuyn/lets_do_paris_before_the_cops_arrive/","True","knowyourbrain","1747826248.837492","renewables now","manual"

We only have about 10% of North America's original forests left. We destroy some 20 million acres of forest on earth every year. We already slashed and burned half the rainforests on earth. Rainforest soil is of poor quality and quantity so farming it only degrades it even faster. Rainforest roots are so dense, they don't require robust and plentiful soils. But, why is this so important to how fast collapse will be? The answer lies straight ahead.

In 2007, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2015 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

In 2014, the IPCC told us emissions must peak by 2030 to stay within 2 °C of warming.

The IPCC says we can make this change because of what they call ""negative-emissions bio-energy"". meaning we will get energy by consuming plant matter so it pulls more CO2 out of the air than it emits; for which, by the way, no such technology exists, and the kicker is, they say, that we will need 1.5 billion acres of NEW farmland to do it. That much farmland is about the size of India, which is equal to nearly 50% of all the arable land on earth. 

The acronym for this fantasy is BECCS (Bio-Energy Carbon Capture & Storage). The real acronym is BS (Bull Shit). Where do you think we'll find all this new farmland? The rainforests. World hunger will guarantee it. Why? Read on.

In 60 years, human agriculture will ground to a stop because of soil loss and degradation. 20% of China's soil and 50% of its groundwater is already unsafe. We are right now already slashing and burning Brazil's rainforests just to feed China's pigs. China's pigs already eat 50% of the soy grown in South America. The Chinese are buying up farmland all over the earth.

Because we add 1 MILLION PEOPLE TO EARTH EVERY 5 DAYS who would very much like to eat over the next 50 years, we will have to grow more food over the next 50 years than we grew in all of the last 10,000 years, combined. This is called math, get used to it, it will rule your life. We already converted nearly half the earth's surface into cities and farmland. Do you seriously believe 9 billion people will stop eating meat and wasting food?

To feed nine billion people all at once for all their lives means we will need 12 million acres of brand new farmland EVERY year for 30 years. Instead, we are losing 24 million acres of farmland EVERY year. We are losing soil at twice the rate we need to grow it just to be able to eat, never mind the additional requirements of BECCS.

Drought is spreading across the earth. Try growing food for 9 billion people without water and soil. We kill elephants and orangutans before slashing and burning Indonesia's remaining rainforests just to grow palm oil that is burned in Northern Europe's German cars. We call this the Green Economy on account of how green people are behind the ears when it comes to their e-CON-omy.

In 25 years we will pass peak energy and minerals.

This will happen when all our new solar panels and wind mills stop working and become expensive junk we can't afford to replace or recycle in times of shortages in water, food, energy, minerals and civility. Recycling their component alloys costs more and uses more energy than mining for them does. Green Jobs without the pension.

Over the next 50 years energy demand will double (at the same time we have to reduce emissions at least 50%) because over 2 billion rural refugees will move to cities, and 75% of the infrastructure they require does not even exist yet. Already, China has poured more concrete in the last few years than the U.S.A. has in all of the last 100 years. Concrete production is a super-emitter of carbon into the air. 

Yet, it also takes 10 times the amount of rated renewable energy to close one equally rated fossil fuel plant simply because renewable energy is intermittent and fossil energy is not. It will be a physical impossibility to meet all future demand with 100% renewable energy and reduce emissions all at the same time. Half the renewable power in Europe comes from burning imported wood from all over the world.
