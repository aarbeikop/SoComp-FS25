"ehxyr4k","t3_ay3f9a","ay3f9a","environment","emotional","There are several ways to ""deny"" climate change. 

1. Believe that climate change is happening but it is unavoidable. 
2. Believe that climate change is happening but it won't be catastrophic. 
3. Believe that climate change is happening but that humans have too small of an impact due to volcanoes and the increasing strength of the sun. 
4. Believe that climate change is happening and is good. (increased temperatures and CO2 will create a more healthy environment for plants and trees).
5. Believing that climate change is happening but it will hurt our enemy countries more than it will hurt us thus increasing our relative power. 
6. Believing that climate change is not happening. 

Anybody who understands what the word ""deny"" means knows that if you are a ""climate change denier"" then you can't also believe that climate change is happening which removes 1-5 from this list. However, language is fluid and words gain multiple definitions so right now all of these are considered ""denying climate change"".

"ehxz8fh","t3_ay3f9a","ay3f9a","environment","emotional","There are a lot of different types of ""climate deniers"". I put that in quotes because it seems like a nonsensical phrase, nobody denies climate, but everybody knows what it means, so I'll leave it.

1. Deny anything is changing. Yes, I have seen people still claiming that nothing is changing, and that all the reports of increased temperatures are fudged.
2. Deny it's man-made. Many deniers dismiss global warming saying ""Climate has always changed."" Indeed it has, and it changes for reasons. These people think it changes for no reason.
3. Deny it's as bad as all that. A lot of people just think it won't be that bad, and we can continue business as usual.
4. Deny we can do anything about it. It's too late to do anything, so live for today.
5. Deny to own the libtards. All of the above subscribe to this view.

What almost all deniers have in common is ignorance of how much is known and can be known. Ignorance by itself is not a bad thing, everybody's ignorant about something. But ignorance without humility is no bueno.

For example, there are those who claim [CO2 lags temperature increase](https://skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature.htm). This is kind of true in some cases, but in the present case, we know how much fossil fuel is being burned with great precision. We need look no further than [BP's meticulous records on that](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html). Who knew people would keep track of how much of a commodity was bought and sold?

So we know we're burning around 3.5 cubic miles of oil equivalent in fossil fuels each year, and because we know the mass of the atmosphere, and we know combustion chemistry, we know the fraction of CO2 added to the atmosphere each year.

Deniers don't even know you can know this, they think it's all too big to be knowable. They imagine climate scientists are all [sitting around the potbelly stove at the country store](https://i2.wp.com/midnitereviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Twilight-Zone-Hocus-Pocus-and-Frisby-5.jpg), a whittlin' and a jawin' about temperatures, making up climate stories to scare the regular folk. Well, that's how I imagine they imagine.

So there are a lot of deniers who do it for no personal gain at all, just out of arrogance and hatred for liberals.","2019-03-06 20:46:04","4","mutatron","1747911057.698223","renewables now","manual"

"ehyf8y3","t3_ay3f9a","ay3f9a","environment","emotional","The #1 reason I've seen is that catastrophic predictions (often made by politicians and environmental activists) have failed to materialize. The ice caps haven't melted, the oceans haven't risen 20 ft, New York isn't underwater, polar bears aren't extinct, etc. The devastating effects of climate change have been 30 years away since the 1970s, which creates a ""boy who cried wolf"" perception around climate change. 

It also doesn't help when the people who are the most concerned about climate change, who say it will kill all of humanity unless we do something immediately, refuse scalable and reliable carbon-free energy alternatives like nuclear and hydro power because they're supposedly too dangerous or not environmentally friendly enough. That suggests they care more about using climate change to push their agenda than with solving this extremely dire problem, which calls into question how dire the problem actually is. And when all the solutions to climate change conveniently align with one political faction's longstanding goals, people from other political factions will naturally become suspicious.

I'm closest to #2 on FNNeocon's list, but with a slight difference.

I approach climate change (CC) from a human perspective in that I'm primarily concerned with its impact on human well-being. The environmental effects of CC are important insofar as they affect humans.

The question of whether or not CC is real is less than half of the debate. Most of the debate centers around the question of “what, if anything, should we do about it?”. Even if we assume that CC is a certainty, that doesn’t mean we should accept any of the proposed solutions for it. 

If we grant that CC is real, 3 conditions must be satisfied before we accept any drastic and compulsory actions to solve it.

1. CC is a major threat to humanity.

2. The consequences of CC are worse than the cost of implementing the solution for it.

3. The solution materially reduces the threat to humanity.

This part of the debate is rarely discussed, and the answers to these conditions are much more nuanced and much more difficult for politicians to exploit. Rather than making hasty decisions based on fear and incomplete information, we should take a step back and make smart decisions that weigh the costs, benefits, and risks of all the options. All the solutions I've seen proposed would either be ineffective or would result in even worse consequences than the problem itself. It doesn't make sense to pursue a cure that's more deadly than the disease.

We currently live in the safest, healthiest, most prosperous era in human history, and the trend lines are only getting better despite the worsening effects of CC, because technology has mostly insulated civilization from the environment. This is why climate-related deaths from floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, and extreme temperatures have fallen 98% over the last hundred years. The ability to insulate ourselves from the environment is far more important than whatever the environment happens to be. Most environments would be deadly to us without clothing or shelter, yet we’re able to thrive all over the world in all kinds of hostile environments because we've developed technological workarounds for almost any issue the environment poses.

Even if the most catastrophic IPCC predictions come true, we’d have a planet with temperatures similar to when dinosaurs were alive. Back then the planet was covered in lush rain forests that supported the largest land animals in the planet’s history for 150 million years. There's no reason why humans wouldn't be able to thrive in such an environment. Catastrophic effects on climate don't imply catastrophic effects on humanity. Climate changes may affect some people more than others, but overall, given all the technological workarounds we've accumulated throughout our history, I don't see anything on the horizon that could stop us from thriving on this planet, at least as far as climate is concerned.

I'm actually more concerned that the fear of CC will lead to rash, ill-conceived, and cripplingly expensive solutions that solve nothing and cause more suffering than CC ever would have. Given the current state of carbon-free energy alternatives, decarbonizing the energy industry essentially means dismantling the energy industry, the industry that powers the modern world and produces all of our food, clean water, clothes, housing, medicine, technology, infrastructure, transportation, communication, goods, resources, jobs, and toilet paper.

If the solution to man-made CC is to take on tens/hundreds of trillions of dollars in debt to radically overhaul the most critical industry that supports the most prosperous era in human history, then we need a very, very high level of certainty that the problem justifies it and that the solution would actually solve it. The solutions to CC aren't risk-free. There's a lot a that we could lose, and it's unclear if the benefit is worth the risk.

On a related note, I think the ""man-made"" aspect of CC is a red herring. It doesn’t matter if CC is man-made or not, we still have to be able to deal with the consequences. If we discover a massive asteroid that's going to hit Earth in 2050, would anyone say we shouldn't do anything because it's not man-made? Likewise, what if this recent warming trend isn't man-made, and we waste tens/hundreds of trillions of dollars, collapse the global economy, and throw the developed world into poverty to solve a problem that we had no control over in the first place? In the long run it’s more important to be able to insulate ourselves from the effects of climate changes because we’ll never be able to control all the causes. We can't control the climate (yet), but we can control how the climate affects us.
