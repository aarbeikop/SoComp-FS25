All but a very, very small group of climate scientists have said that we need nuclear power as part of the solution to climate change. Unfortunately, ALL the big international environmental NGOs (ENGOs) actively oppose nuclear power, and a great many climate activists repeat their bullshit talking points.

You can do far more than you think in changing the future by focusing on changing minds. Ask all your friends and family members if they contribute to Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the WWF, Friends of the Earth, etc. If they do, discuss with them how they can stop sending funds to those organizations with a polite note that says they will consider donating again once their wrongheaded opposition to nuclear power is reversed. 

I know others will disagree, but it is my considered opinion that you can do more to prevent future emissions by doing this than by doing anything else.","2019-08-16 17:49:34","9","Will_Power","1747923474.5291588","renewables now","manual"
"ex7toq9","t3_cr9r5m","cr9r5m","climatechange","action-oriented","Concentrate on your own life. Don't buy cute little plastic bottles of water. If you need water buy it from a water store and reuse your five gallon containers. 
Basically reuse everything you can. Do you need new clothe or can you continue wearing the ones you have?
Do you need to eat like a pig or can you stop when you are full?
Do you need to drive to the store everyday or can you do all your shopping once a month?
Do you need to go watch your favorite teams and musicians or can you watch them from home? (Why watch them anyways? At most they put you into a better mood but you can attain a better mood doing something constructive.) 
Do you need to have children that will cause even more environmental damage or can you abstain. Don't let people talk you into this. It's BS.

In general think about living your own life cleanly. That might also include helping those immediately around you to live like you.

Finally, become energy independent. Get enough solar panels and install them yourself. Then get a battery powered car and charge them from your solar panels. Finally get enough battery backup so you can disconnect from the grid. Then laugh at those who think we can't do this. And be sure to vote down any attempts to make power plants because they are not needed.","2019-08-17 17:58:09","2","bob420g","1747923474.5310578","renewables now","manual"
"exbfe36","t3_cr9r5m","cr9r5m","climatechange","action-oriented","Buy green power, if available. The power company I used (green mountain energy) sells 100% renewables. I have little guilt turning on my aircon (though i keep it usually at 79 or 80) since I am not emitting an ounce of co2 by doing that.

In the larger scheme, that also sends a market signal that companies should invest in more renewables.

I think that is one of the biggies.","2019-08-18 12:06:55","2","[deleted]","1747923474.5323362","renewables now","manual"
"ex3vwfm","t3_cr9r5m","cr9r5m","climatechange","action-oriented","Use less ... less energy, less stuff.  It doesn't matter how you do it because everyone is different; the main thing is to tune into what you really need and what really makes you happy.  Think about why you need or want something then ask yourself why that is important or if it really is.

Our society is using more energy per capita every year in spite of advances in efficiency.  Nuclear advocates aren't asking why we need more and more and more, conservation has never been seriously considered because our economic system depends on growth.","2019-08-16 21:57:53","1","nettlemind","1747923474.5407639","renewables now","manual"
"ex50afa","t3_cr9r5m","cr9r5m","climatechange","action-oriented","1) Take a close look at the true scale of atmospheric components. In particular, focus on CO2.

2) Make a good-faith estimate of the magnitude of a nontrivial impact on the global atmosphere. I usually start the bidding at 100 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year. 

3) Since an individual's top reasonable CO2 footprint doesn't normally exceed 100 tons of CO2 annually...quit thinking about the impact of individual actions on the global climate. That impact is negligible, as long as you refrain from burning down entire forests and starting nuclear wars anyway. 

4) Instead, make a regular and occasionally public practice of discarding views which aren't supported by both data and some pretty rigorous analysis. Anyone who manages to do this, in public sometimes, is already in the top 1% of climate warriors.","2019-08-17 03:57:48","1","DocHarford","1747923474.542492","renewables now","manual"
