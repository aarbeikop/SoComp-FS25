Any time it's extrapolated out to mean a worse QoL or worse future for *them* (And sometimes their children). Also, when it goes to a scope beyond what they focus on - how can the normal people understand the interactions between energy and resource flows and population+consumption and Jevons paradox, etc etc. In addition, I just think people don't have the capacity. They are full with working and trying to keep their life together as it is - they don't have the mental capacity to delve into understanding any of this, so it's easier to simply turn away.","2019-11-12 21:11:32","3","TheNewN0rmal","1747928606.107575","renewables now","manual"

Most people probably assume that it will somehow blow over or that there is nothing to be done.
 
>Which methods have you used to successfully draw people's attention to how destructively we're existing? 

Mentioned it to a close friend who lives on a relatively remote hillstation  and told him I'll be coming over in 20-30 years. But otherwise why would anyone do this? Best case: they believe you and go on with daily life, Worst case: They thing you're a lunatic.

>Did it lead to a permanent change in their behavior?

Lol no

>I'm primarily looking for feedback on your experiences with the psychological 'walls' you've been hitting; the 'tap-out' points where you lose people and only make them more resolute in denying the obvious.

Telling a person that they are doomed, does not change their behaviour, that would be the biggest ""wall"" I guess.

>If we can't stop it, we must at least bear witness to it. We can't give into to hopelessness... 

Nihilism is not something that can be argued against, but ok.

>or if we do, do it by removing yourself from the system, not by doubling down on our shamelessness and giving into 'everyone else is doing it so it must be ok'... 

This is basically the prisoners dilemma on a large scale. If everyone changes their lifestyle, everyone is better off but If not enough people do it, the people who change their lifestyle are on the losing end.


>I feel like we hold our toddlers to a higher standard of behavior than we hold each other, and hold ourselves to none.

This is an obvious, natural and logical thing to hold your toddler or kid to a higher standard so that they atleast learn some of it.","2019-11-13 00:10:09","1","luvidepenu","1747928606.11049","renewables now","manual"

In the end, first-world people don't want to give up the luxuries that fossil fuels provide.  They will gladly let the poorer people suffer the consequences so that they can have a few more years of electronic distractions and entertainment.

It seems we are hardwired to be profoundly selfish and there seems to be little effort on the part of the first-world nations to swim against that particular stream.","2019-11-13 05:25:13","1","bastardofdisaster","1747928606.1147242","renewables now","manual"
"f7dqzf5","t3_dvemfa","dvemfa","collapse","skeptical","I think there are many reasons for denial. I’ll just mention some that have stood out to me. 

Bias. Hearing about climate change but the individual experience suggests otherwise (e.g. “this winter was really cold!”). The instinct here is that individual experience is the ultimate evidence. To me,
this bias also points to a general misunderstanding of the scientific process and what constitutes evidence.

Contrarianism. Experiential “evidence” contradicts what scientists are telling people, therefore other people who believe the science are perceived as misled. This often leads to a stubborn confidence, and suddenly ego is in the game. Other supporting arguments are created and denial can quickly become a whole worldview.

Religious people who think that God wouldn’t let the world burn because he made it for us. This is another worldview that fosters denial.

Propaganda. I think this one is well-discussed. It doesn’t help that industry has fought to create a denier culture by obscuring evidence and creating confusion.

Cognitive dissonance. It’s really difficult to change one’s worldview when faced with new evidence. It takes some pretty serious humility, discipline, and psychological strength. If an idea (in this case climate denial) has taken root in somebody’s worldview, it will be difficult to change that.

The best course of action IMO is to keep pointing to the evidence, and discussing how to form opinions based on evidence rather than experience. We can’t win arguments if it’s only about opinions. Not every denier will come around, but the evidence is only getting stronger.","2019-11-13 06:20:53","1","casualwes","1747928606.117385","renewables now","manual"
