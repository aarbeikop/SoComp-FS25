I decided that there has to be a reason that all of these politicians are denying climate change or the human cause of it, so what was it? Well, we already know, don’t we? So I went to OpenSecrets and I started hunting down contributions from companies who stand to lose something if the government intervenes to help stop climate change. I sorted by career contributions. This is gonna be long.

Thanks for reading all of this. Some personal notes: this shit is seriously disgusting. It's really enraging how little it takes to buy someone off to help destroy the world. Of the 131 politicians from the article, there were only five I couldn’t find financial conflicts with. That’s 96% of these people, upon even the most cursory of glances, that have been proven to prioritize money over the health of the Earth. I can’t stress this enough: Fuck. Them.

I left off airline companies and (for the most part) chemical companies who produce plastics. I don't know why I did this and I'm not gonna go back and change it now. But if you're clicking through the links, keep that in mind, too. 

I've only used the one source, but OpenSecrets is widely used by reputable sources to find campaign contribution information. They are quite transparent with their methodology on their site. 

All those repeat companies are absolutely not a coincidence. These are the types of conspiracy theories that people should be worried about. 

I just went with obvious companies who stand to lose something from government intervention to combat climate change. I definitely didn't look up every company that was on a rep's page. If you find additional things you think I should add, let me know.

If you catch any errors I've made or think I need to take off certain companies, let me know and we can talk about it. 

Again, thanks for reading. And fucking VOTE.","2019-04-28 14:49:27","123","15","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/bibzcw/oc_politicians_killing_the_planet/","True","BloodyJourno","1747912615.6912901","renewables now","manual"

I decided that there has to be a reason that all of these politicians are denying climate change or the human cause of it, so what was it? Well, we already know, don’t we? So I went to OpenSecrets and I started hunting down contributions from companies who stand to lose something if the government intervenes to help stop climate change. I sorted by career contributions. This is gonna be long.

Thanks for reading all of this. Some personal notes: this shit is seriously disgusting. It's really enraging how little it takes to buy someone off to help destroy the world. Of the 131 politicians from the article, there were only five I couldn’t find financial conflicts with. That’s 96% of these people, upon even the most cursory of glances, that have been proven to prioritize money over the health of the Earth. I can’t stress this enough: Fuck. Them.

I left off airline companies and (for the most part) chemical companies who produce plastics. I don't know why I did this and I'm not gonna go back and change it now. But if you're clicking through the links, keep that in mind, too. 

I've only used the one source, but OpenSecrets is widely used by reputable sources to find campaign contribution information. They are quite transparent with their methodology on their site. 

All those repeat companies are absolutely not a coincidence. These are the types of conspiracy theories that people should be worried about. 

I just went with obvious companies who stand to lose something from government intervention to combat climate change. I definitely didn't look up every company that was on a rep's page. If you find additional things you think I should add, let me know.

If you catch any errors I've made or think I need to take off certain companies, let me know and we can talk about it. 

Again, thanks for reading. And fucking VOTE.","2019-04-28 14:33:04","27","3","0.94","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/bibtg0/oc_politicians_killing_the_planet/","True","BloodyJourno","1747912864.5439732","renewables now","manual"

**Extinction Rebellion: Why it's not even much too little, much too late.**

It can only be a good thing that so many people are suddenly talking about climate change, and about the myriad other components of the oncoming eco-apocalypse. These conversations are long overdue. However, as things stand, we have a very long way to go before the brutal reality of our predicament becomes widely understood. There are multiple levels of delusion and denial to work through first.

Level 1 is that of the climate change deniers. These are the people who've spent the last thirty years trying to convince everybody that large-scale climate change isn't happening at all, or that human activity is not responsible for triggering it in the first place and continuing to drive it. They simply don't understand the science, or, more frequently, don't want to. To do so would require them to completely rethink their political agenda, and they have no intention of doing that. There are still vast numbers of such people at large, especially in the United States, although their numbers are steadily dwindling as the effects of climate change become more obvious.

Level 2 is that of the pollyannas. “Optimists”, they call themselves. They admit the prognosis is bad, but react badly to anybody who tells them it is too late to stop climate change now. They have no time for such “pessimism”. Perhaps they will accuse the “pessimist” of selfishly advocating inaction because they don't want to make any personal sacrifices. Or they'll accuse them of giving up too easily: “We mustn't give up hope, because hope is the only thing that keeps people going!” If you talk to them about overpopulation, they'll tell you that fertility rates are falling globally, and that if only we could end global wealth inequality that it would fall faster. Never mind the fact that there's already far too many of us and that even if those humans of childbearing age only have one child (fat chance), there will still be a couple of billion more of us before the population starts declining voluntarily. Or perhaps we can convince everybody to go vegetarian and stop flying, and this will make the key difference. Or lots of investment in renewables and recycling. The numbers of people at level 2 is rising, because more and more people are being forced to abandon level 1, or simply becoming aware of these issues for the first time. But it is still delusion/denial.

Level 3 is that of the people who believe it is too late to stop climate change, and the rest of the eco-apocalypse. In one important sense it is wrong to call this denial or delusion, because what they are saying, from any mainstream point of view, is true: we really cannot stop climate change. However, “it's too late” implies that at some point, presumably relatively recently, it *wasn*'t too late. Maybe ten years ago we could have stopped it. Maybe we could have stopped it if the Hippy Revolution of the late 60s hadn't turned out to be a miserable failure. I believe the truth is that it has never been “too late”, because the seeds of this predicament we find ourselves in now were sown before the dawn of human history. Certainly it the fateful moment was no later than the first agricultural (or “neolithic”) revolution circa 14000 years ago. It may even be the case that *Homo sapiens* has been heading in this direction for as long as we have been *Homo sapiens*. We are supposed to live as tribal hunter-gatherers – that is what evolution designed us for. But evolution also provided us with the cognitive power to create a global techno-industrial civilisation. Unfortunately, it didn't provide us with the ability to make that civilisation sustainable.

But what, you might ask, is the point of moving beyond level 3? Even if the above paragraph is true, why should we actually admit it? Wouldn't it be pointlessly destructive to do so?

I went through this process thirty years ago, in my early 20s. I'd spent my teens learning about science, environmentalism and politics. I watched as the United States torpedoed the early attempts to co-ordinate global action on climate change. I joined the Green Party and experienced the futility of trying to change anything that way. And eventually I came to understand the sociology and psychology that lay behind our abject failure to do anything about the underlying problems. Slowly but surely I was forced to admit to myself that climate change was not going to be stopped, because there was never going to be sufficient political will to stop it. Why? Partly because of the psychology of the electorate: of ordinary human beings, including most of those who call themselves environmentalists. We just aren't willing to give up our modern standard of living. But mostly because of a problem referred to as “The Tragedy of the Commons”. The global environment, including the climate, is a shared resource. It is in nobody's interest to use that resource in a sustainable way unless everybody else does too. And how the hell is that ever going to happen? It would require global co-operation on an unprecedented and unimaginable scale. It would require the Chinese to stop industrialising, for the western world to subsidise the “developing” world sufficiently to convince it stop “developing” (no, there is no such thing as “sustainable development”). In short, it's the stuff of fairytales. It was quite obvious to me thirty years ago that it wasn't going to happen, and nothing that has happened since then has given me any reason to think I was wrong. Thirty years later, greenhouse emissions are still rising, the seas are becoming ever more polluted, soil is still eroding and the population is still increasing. And all the rest.

One thing that really has changed since then is the number of people aware of it. Thirty years ago, my 20 year old self was in a very lonely place. Almost nobody understood, and the few who did were inaccessible to me, because there was no such thing as the internet. Today I see many people going through something like I did. In my case it involved a nervous breakdown. I was suicidal. People thought I was mad, but I wasn't. I was sane, but trying to come to terms with living in a completely insane world. I did not feel like I wanted to live the life I ahead of me. I came out the other side of that process a changed person -- somebody who had effectively given up on my own future. There is much more I could say about this, and how the course of my life was affected, but this article is not supposed to be about me.

What is the point in admitting that techno-industrial civilisation is going to collapse?

The Extinction Rebellion of the late twenty-teens will fail, just as surely as the Hippy Revolution of the late nineteen-sixties did. Both were based on an idealistic hope for a better future, but lacked the foundations of realism that any movement needs if it is to end in success. Individual choice won't be effective enough, because not enough people will make the right choices, and a co-ordinated global response is economic and political fantasy.

So there is now a stark choice before us. There is only one risky and remote chance to stop climate change now, and that is geo-engineering. Regardless of the fact it might have catastrophic unexpected side-effects, it is the only way. It is one of the options available. We may end up taking it, but that can only happen after a widespread acceptance of the true severity of the crisis. The other option is to simply accept we are in the early stages of an unstoppable mass extinction of species and a major die-off of humans, due both to catastrophic and irreversible climate change and a plethora of other human-created ecological disasters.

The point in admitting that techno-industrial civilisation is going to collapse is this: that is what the future actually holds, and the sooner we start preparing for it, the better. We need to prepare as individuals, as families, as communities and as nations. Trying to prepare for it at a global level is unlikely to work, for the same reason that there will never be an effective global response to climate change. But at the lower levels, we can prepare. We can decide how to equip ourselves, in terms of knowledge and skills. We can choose what to tell our children, if we decide to  bring any into such a troubled world. And we can have political debates informed by the harsh reality of our true predicament, rather than the many levels of denial and delusion that have prevailed for far too long. In the end, all there really is to play for is the preservation of the best bits of human culture and knowledge of the last three millenia, in the hope that if another kinds of civilisation eventually rises from the ashes of our own, it might be able to learn from our mistakes.

Those political discussions are likely to take many of the Extinction Rebels a long way out of their comfort zone. We're not just going to have to stop pretending it's not too late, and that false hope is better than no hope. We're also going to have to talk about things like population control, and how we are going to deal with an aging and ailing population we will lack the resources to look after. And we're going to have to get very real about immigration, because if we don't stop climate change then the current trickle of climate refugees is going to turn into a massive tsunami. The inhabitable parts of the northern hemisphere will become something of a lifeboat, which will sink if its borders are not ruthlessly controlled. There will be no room for political correctness when the reality of this hits home. The fact that the ancestors of white Europeans are disproportionately responsible for causing climate change is not going to justify allowing that lifeboat to sink. And in fact we can see from the current direction of politics in the Western world that the electorate will not let that happen anyway: if those in power aren't willing to take the necessary action, the electorate will replace them with “populists” who will. And yes, this is going to mean that innocent non-Europeans are going to die, just because they happened to be born in a part of the world where climate change hit harder and faster. Life isn't fair, and it is going to become much unfairer.

"bg947z","collapse","skeptical","It is spring, I went for a walk, no birds, no bugs.","Well, I did see one dead bumblebee. No idea how long it had been there. I live in a rural area, spring time used to be filled with birdsong. Spring was filled with insects. Bats. I see very very few of any of these animals. I walk in silent woods, that used to be my sanctuary, my safe place. The noises of all the animals filled me with love, joy, and peace. 

My meditations are disturbed by the silence, my former places of spiritual renewal make me so profoundly sad. 

We did it. We killed enough of the good gifts given us so abundantly, so freely, that we are going to die. 


We are going to die, because we thought we were better than anything else in all creation. We are a small part of creation. No more important than any other part. But we forgot where we came from. We forgot you cannot keep taking without giving back. 

We forgot that everything is interconnected, what you do to the least of you, you do to me, said a wise man once upon a time. 

Everything has a reaction. If you poison the soil it dies. If the soil is dead your gardens won't grow. The gardens need the bugs and worms and bees and microbes. 


Agricultural runoff is killing the nurseries of the oceans. 

Dammed rivers are killing the fish we love. No fish are killing the bears. 

Kill the wolves you say, now the deer population is out of control.

Fill the land with cattle and destroy the delicate and beautiful ecosystem that took millions of years to create.

Drain the swamp, why are the migratory birds all gone? Because you drained the swamps, straightened the rivers, plowed up the nesting sites and polluted their feeding grounds. 

Cut down all the trees, why are those flowers I loved no longer growing? They needed the trees.

Why is the city so noisy and stinky. Because there are too many of us. 


Why isn't the sky blue? It was blue when I was a child. Now it is a weird orange brown haze. 


I used to see the stars at night. I could see the milky way. Have you seen a photo of earth at night? So lit up, night never comes. The night animals get confused. They die. They cannot live like this. We put them in zoos to save them. We put them in zoos and they all go insane. We think we are helping them. 


We can't go back I am told. Ok well, that's it then. We fucked it all up with our big brains. 

It isn't the smartest animal who survives this apocolypse we are experiencing, it's the one most able to adapt. I fear we humans won't pass this test. 


The meek shall inherit the earth. I think the meek are going to be single cell organizisms. So it begins again. 


Yes I cannot spell. I don't care. The above is a stream of consciousness bit I did after my daily walk today.

The  future of Renewable energy is bright with TerraGreen as we have built a  renewable energy platform with the help of blockchain technology.

When  energy project will tokenize their energy on TerraGreen, then it will be  counted as an Energy Token of a particular energy project. Hence, this  energy token will be backed by real energy. 

Now if any energy  project wants to collaborate with the utilities for use of generated  energy token then it will be stable coin and rate of this particular  won’t be changing. So, the consumer will be paying their energy  consumption with the help of this energy tokens. 

These tokes will  be of low cost than that of the normal fees that you have been charged,  which will be beneficiary for all of them to invest in TerraGreen.

Hence,  it has made easy for all who are related to the renewable sector to  connect to each other transparently as the tokens are counted as the  energy consumed and not the actual value they are known as energy backed  tokens and hence this whole ecosystem is hence called energy backed  economy.
