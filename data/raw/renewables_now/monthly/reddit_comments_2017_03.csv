"der71lz","t3_5yllhh","5yllhh","collapse","skeptical","From the moment that Homo Saps started smelting metal and firing ceramics, we became an unsustainable type of culture.  That happened around 10,000 years ago at the beginning of the Age of Agriculture.

Since then, we have been leveraging up and burning through one energy source or another, and now the jig is up.  From here on in, it is pay as you go.  There is no huge bank account of available per capita energy to access any more.","2017-03-10 15:14:55","25","ReverseEngineer77","1747870057.862685","renewables now","manual"

"der7tbj","t3_5yllhh","5yllhh","collapse","skeptical","You have two arguments common here, doomer and booster. 

The booster argument sounds remarkably like yours but the conclusion is ""Every time we think we're about to run out of a resource, smarty-smart people invent something else as a substitute and the March of Progress continues."" 

The doomer argument, yours, is that yes, history may have been like that but we're running out of substitutes. 

Myself, I keep swinging between the two but not at the extremes. Doomers like Kunstler will say that we'll never ever again have energy as cheap as classic fossil fuels. It looks like we might be able to swing it with renewables. But that puts us in the critique Stephen Hawking made along the lines of (paraphrasing) ""Say we invented a magic fuel source like clean fusion that gives us all the energy we need, just the waste heat of economic activity at current rates of expansion will see the planetary ecosystem smothered in 200 years."" 

Die now or die later! 

My personal suspicion is we as a species will make it but after much unnecessary horror and heartbreak. Collapse doesn't have to happen -- there are solutions, but a partial collapse will happen due to political stupidity. I would compare it to the clash of civilizations where entrenched idiocy by the ruling classes makes war an inevitability and peace only comes after one side or the other is completely bled out.

"der6czh","t3_5yllhh","5yllhh","collapse","skeptical","Great perspective! I often argue that the 17th century started to become unsustainable because we needed to switch from wood to coal. Didn't know that you guys had peat as an interim step, and that your forest was gone so much earlier.

Concepts that people developed in the last 20 years, like rocket stoves and mass heaters; were actually developed then abandoned over a hundred years ago.

When medieval people ran out of peat is was find something else and keep going or regress back to the mean of human life. They found coal and went nuts. Then they found oil and gas. I'd think that if peak oil really digs deep and puts a damper on civilization before some other shortage of phosphorous or something, then we will probably go full ham with thorium and other fission reactors to make up the difference. That dire need is a good driving force to spur us on to more advancements, but there is no implicit guarantee that we will be successful in bridging the gap ad infinitum.","2017-03-10 19:32:34","2","blehblehthaw","1747870057.891222","renewables now","manual"

Read a book on the Black Plague, where at least 50% of the population of Europe died.    
    
According to author, the population in England was even more susceptible when the plague hit their shores. A total population of 6 million had less immunity due to local famine.  
   
   
Population of the UK currently ? 56-58 million.  
  
  
The good news ? Technology and Global Trade made it possible for the 1st world to support an even more dense population.  
  
  
The book also made a case that the Black Plague had the same effect of a nuclear war in culling the human population: Similar Death Tolls of 50%.
