"4fayvp","environment","emotional","Given the option which would you choose: a Nuclear power plant or a natural gas power plant","Here is my dilemma, I am thinking about starting a campaign to shutdown a couple of coal plants in my state (4 or 5) and I want them to be replaced by sustainable energy wind or solar (geothermal doesn't make sense our state). However, that I am going to attempt to take offline, are in areas of increasing energy needs and they also are rather high capacity facilities, in terms of output (50-150MW). And so I am stuck trying to figure out what would be the best alternative so that I can stop the usage of coal now, but not hamper energy production while I attempt to secure land rights and utility usage for wind turbines, as well as rights to rooftops for PV's.          
               
The easiest option is natural gas, because the coal plants can have their generators swapped, making the retrofit pretty simple. However, that just continues to support fracking and the burning of fossil fuels.          
          
One nuclear plant has a large enough capacity to cover the total output of all the coal plants combined, along with some natural gas plants in the same areas. But nuclear has the obvious drawbacks.          
          
So which would you choose? (please be realistic/pragmatic)","2016-04-18 08:56:56","3","16","0.72","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/4fayvp/given_the_option_which_would_you_choose_a_nuclear/","True","greatniss","1747847653.469517","renewables now","manual"
"4dfzpl","science","scientific","American Chemical Society AMA: I'm Jane Wissinger, from the University of Minnesota, Ask me anything about green chemistry education and research. AMA.","Hi Reddit, 


I am an Associate Professor and the Organic Chemistry Laboratory Director at the University of Minnesota (U of MN) in the Department of Chemistry.  I have taught organic chemistry to over 20,000 students the last 23 years in both the lecture hall and laboratory.  My passion the last fourteen years has been incorporating the principles of green chemistry into my laboratory curriculum and motivating colleagues and instructors to apply [green chemistry concepts](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html) in their research and instruction.
 

Since including that first solvent-free synthesis into my organic chemistry laboratory course in 2002, there has been a snowball effect of student and graduate TA enthusiasm for performing research in the area of green chemistry in my group.  Students dig it and have been the drivers for the development of several new teaching experiments which model the use of safer solvents, less hazardous reagents, the use of renewable starting materials, and reduction of waste.  Employing our experiments and selecting from the wealth of green chemistry experiments now available in the primary literature and textbooks our whole organic chemistry curriculum has a green chemistry approach.   Ask me about resources and transforming your laboratory course with modern examples of green chemistry.
 

As a senior PI working on broader impacts in the Center for Sustainable Polymers at the U of MN, I am also excited about several experiments we have developed and implemented at both the high school and college level on the topic of plastics from renewable feedstocks and design for degradation.  I am not a polymer chemist by training but happy to share how we have weaved new innovative technologies in the field of sustainable polymers into curricular materials.  Ask me about how to translate research results in green chemistry into teaching opportunities in the lab and classroom.    

**I will be back at 11am EDT (8 am PDT, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!** -edit ACS for time accuracy

Hi Reddit Community, I am online and happy to begin addressing questions. There is a great mix of green chemistry education questions and plastics/polymer questions.  The latter I can address from a basic research vantage point to the level I am familiar, but hopefully those closer to the consumer product end can chime in...and I see the plastic bag controversy has taken off.  

My expertise is teaching students about how chemists are addressing green and sustainability issues so ask me about student response to the topic and resources to get started.

Dear Reddit contributors, I need to sign off now to teach two lectures.  Thank you for your questions and interest in all things green.  I hope to check back later.  JW
