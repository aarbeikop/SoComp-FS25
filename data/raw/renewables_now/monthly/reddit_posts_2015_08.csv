Karl et al 2015 uses SST data to adjust ARGO data and determines the heat is in the ocean. Though the recent trans indo-pacific paper entails there is no heat below 700m, and likely lies within 100-300m of the ocean's surface.   

The [USCRN and USCHN](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=cmbushcn&parameter=anom-tavg&time_scale=p12&begyear=2005&endyear=2015&month=12) which are significant due to their stations being designed to observe the climate, not the weather (Having been placed in locations where development is not expected for 50-100 years, thus requiring minimal adjustment for UHI and other affects) ranging from Russia, Alaska, Canada, to various locations in the US, Mexico and Hawaii. About 6% of the landmass on earth, but none the less one of the best built to purpose networks we have...shows no significant warming.     

--------  

Now obviously the ocean + land = surface, ergo heat on the ocean = heat on the surface.   
Heat in the ocean however should have a secondary affect, one that we have been warned about quite a few times actually.   

Sea level rise.    

Heat in water causes expansion which of course affects SLR. So logically the heat (not in the atmosphere, likely not on the land, but in the ocean) should be causing expansion and thus increase SLR exponentially as heat continues to rise exponentially.

And here's the problem, it hasn't.

>What was learned
Over the nine years of their study, the three researchers report that the mean GIA-adjusted mass gain and mass loss in the 19 areas of their primary focus amounted to -(0.7 ± 0.4 mm/year) of sea-level fall and +(1.8 ± 0.6) mm/year of sea-level rise, for a net effect of +(1.1 ± 0.6) mm/year. Then, to obtain a figure for total sea-level change, they added the steric component of +(0.5 ± 0.5) mm/year, which was derived by Leuliette and Willis (2011), to their net result to obtain a final (geocenter neglected) result of +(1.6 ± 0.8) mm/year and **a final (geocenter corrected) result of +(1.7 ± 0.8) mm/year.**

>What it means
The final geocenter-corrected result of Baur et al. is most heartening, as Chambers et al. (2012) indicate that ""sea level has been rising on average by 1.7 mm/year over the last 110 years,"" as is also suggested by the analyses of Church and White (2006) and Holgate (2007). **Concomitantly, the air's CO2 concentration has risen by close to a third. And, still, it has not impacted the rate-of-rise of global sea level!**   

Corroborated by NOAA's ""The Budget of Recent Global Sea Level Rise 2005–2012""   

>The sum of steric sea level rise and the ocean mass component has a trend of 1.1 ± 0.8 mm/a over the period when the Paulson GIA mass correction is applied, well overlapping total sea level rise observed by Jason-1 and Jason-2 (1.3 ± 0.9 mm/a) within a 95% confidence interval.   

And Chambers et al

> sea level has been rising on average by 1.7 mm/year over the last 110 years  

Further, it appears to have slowed.

>These new calculations highlight a reduction in the rate of sea level rise since 2005, by ~2 mm/yr. **This represents a 60% reduction compared to the 3.3 mm/yr sea level rise (glacial isostatic adjustment correction applied) measured between 1993 and 2005.** Since November 2005, MSL is accurately measured by a single satellite, Jason-1. **However the error analysis performed here indicates that the recent reduction in MSL rate is real.**  

Along with evidence that mankind has no affect on the sea level.

>We propose that: thermal expansion simulated by climate models may previously have been underestimated owing to their not including volcanic forcing in their control state; the rate of glacier mass loss was larger than previously estimated, and was not smaller in the first than in the second half of the century; the Greenland ice-sheet could have made a positive contribution throughout the century; groundwater depletion and reservoir impoundment, which are of opposite sign, may have been approximately equal in magnitude. We show that it is possible to reconstruct the timeseries of GMSLR from the quantified contributions, apart from a constant residual term which is small enough to be explained as a long-term contribution from the Antarctic ice-sheet. The reconstructions account for the approximate constancy of the rate of GMSLR during the 20th century, **which shows small or no acceleration, despite the increasing anthropogenic forcing.** Semi-empirical methods for projecting GMSLR depend on the existence of a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR, **but the implication of our closure of the budget is that such a relationship is weak or absent during the 20th century.**   


---------------   

So no rising heat in the atmosphere, no rising heat from the CRN. Most papers agree it's in the ocean, but the ocean doesn't appear to be responding. So either the heat is negligible, or the ocean is handling it. [I also have studies indicating acidification isn't a concern]   

Ultimately there's no reasons we can't attempt to cut our emissions and work on viable renewable power sources. Like nuclear for instance. Though the heat either appears to be far less than what was predicted, or is having a negligible affect.

"3fis8t","climate","scientific","How doomed are we?","I've taken a hard line approach recently in debates. I kind of sound like are an arsehole doing that. It's partly to break out of a particular mindset that demands keep a few things in my head at the same time. It's also to wake myself and others into the implications of what's being said by mainstream climate scientists.

The mainstream science points to probably 2 degrees of warming being expected now. As I understand it that will cause serious amounts of damage to societies around the world. The impact of that cannot be contained.

To prevent more serious damage we would need to have either the techno fix or political revolution to start now to prevent more serious warming.

If I say this I am accused of being a pessimist, an alarmist or excusing reckless behaviour.

The techno fix would be great if it was here, if it worked, if it was on the scale we need. I can't help but seeing it isn't there. I really applaud the effort. But well meaning action is not a solution. I don't think renewable power is there yet.

On top of that the general activist position is anti tech and pro politics. Though the desperate situation has forced people to change there mind and call for anything that might help. Many see tech as too late and the only answer is politics.

I am told that the political solution is here only if only people would choose it or knew about it. It ultimately sounds like asking people to give up their lifestyle in order to avoid giving up their lifestyle. ""Just sacrifice everything that you currently enjoy, to avoid losing it at some point in the future. Everyone will be so impressed they will emulate you.""

It's baffling because pretty much everyone who asks for the sacrifice is not walking the talk, and those are the believers. The demand for sacrifice always seems limited to luxury items, it never covers hospitals, basic agriculture, essential commuting, administration, law enforcement. It's always easy points about third holidays, new phones and second cars. Sacrifice means sacrificing jobs, medicine, healthcare, diets, pets, schools, family size, everyday goods.

How are the politics supposed to work internationally? Often the debate will be routed into issues of colonialism and historic exploitation as if somehow the debate is moral rather than scientific in origin. The rhetoric often says the rich countries should set a moral example. As if that is how international economic policy is worked out. No country is going to be morally shamed into not industrialising.

Most countries constantly try to boost growth anyway they can to avoid economic decline which they, democracy and dictatorship alike, know means instant political turmoil and collapse. Yet climate action demands economic decline. The win win days are gone.

The response to that is the environment demands it.

It begins to sound like a preacher trying to cure the sick or motivational speaker, ""failure is not an option."" The reality is failure is an option. Failure is more than expected.

It's a terrible thing to contemplate but I feel people are pulling their punches to avoid saying terrible things.

The older I get the more interested I am in how things will be than in how things ought to be.

I know this possibly sounds offensive. I now reddit is largely US based and the debate there is more about denial. I'm coming from a position of being in Europe and onside for 20 years.

Does anyone else think this?

How far off am I?

Does your solution sound realistic to yourself?

I guess I'm just in a similar position as the Dark Mountain people.

**tl;dr**

The science says we are most likely doomed.

Activism demands people give up their lifestyle to avoid giving up their lifestyle.","2015-08-02 16:40:50","75","251","0.88","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/3fis8t/how_doomed_are_we/","True","simstim_addict","1747829570.709955","renewables now","manual"
