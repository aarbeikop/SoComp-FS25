"amtq1s","collapse","skeptical","I just made this post in my local facebook group and I just noticed how fucked we are"," No, he didn't and this isn't Global warming it is climate change. It is actually very worrying that so many people believe this. This Event, the coldest it ever been in many states is a result of climate change. We are seeing the effects happen. We only used to call it Global Warming because of that's what we thought with the science research we had before what was going on. The world is warming but that doesn't mean that snowstorms can't happen. It means it will happen more often. Extreme weather will happen more often. We need to do something about it or our kids. (Kids that are born in 2019!) Will not live to see 2100. It is time to stop making jokes about it. The evidence is all around us. Australia is flooding on one side and facing forest fires on the other. Changing to clean renewable energy is cheaper than ever before.  


We don't have 20 years, we don't have 10 years, we don't even have 5 years. We need to start demanding a change in how we get our energy now. We have only two choices, Keep making jokes about how something that is happening right in front of us is not happening, or we start demanding change at a local then state then federal level. This isn't about me, it isn't about you. It is about every single person on this planet. If we do nothing we will all die. Kids born today, won't be able to have kids or grandkids as we will be leaving an unfixable dying planet. We already lost 1/2 of every species in the world. We need to try and prevent any more. Please, this is not a scare tactic it is the truth. You do nothing and the world will end  


If you just read this and think I am overreacting, you are part of the problem. You are making the next generation be the last one humans ever have.

(Post said Trump sloved global warming)  


Also adding for reddit. It is a Kind of scary feeling to see just how many people just don't want to accept this is happening. I mean I know a lot of people didn't believe it. Didn't want to believe despite it happening all around us. It is just a horrible feeling of doom.

"ars87z","collapse","skeptical","The inconvenient Truth of Modern Civilization's Inevitable Collapse","The current level of fossil fuel consumption globally is now roughly five times higher than in the 1950s, and one-and-half times higher than in the 1980s when the science of global warming had already been confirmed and accepted by governments with the implication that there was an urgent need to act\*. More than half of all fossil fuel emissions that have been released in the last 25 years are more than were released in all of recorded history before 1990(CO2 emissions are 55% higher today than in 1990\*\*). 

20 international conferences on fossil fuel use reduction and an international treaty that entered into force in 1994 have not stopped this rise. Existing international agreements are toothless because they have no verification or enforcement and do not require anything remotely close to what is needed to avoid catastrophe. To make matters worse, the fossil fuel industry has employed a well-financed and [highly effective global disinformation campaign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/10/how-fossil-fuel-industry-got-media-think-climate-change-was-debatable/) to confuse and sow doubt in the public mind about the reality of climate change. The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the top four in the past four years, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)\*\*\*. 

These verifiable facts show how dependent our modern way of life has become on fossil fuels. In fact, an [article](https://www.axios.com/despite-renewables-growth-there-has-never-been-energy-transition-e11b0cf5-ce1d-493c-b1ae-e7dbce483473.html) from a few months ago lays bare the reality that throughout the past two hundred years and with recent ""alternative"" or ""renewable"" energy sources, humans have only added to the total energy they consume without ever really having displaced the old, polluting ones. We are kidding ourselves if we think there is going to be any sort of orderly transition to sustainability which will only come about after collapse of modern civilization. 

The people who have studied this problem for years and from every angle have come to the same conclusion —technology simply won't save us. Making things more efficient has its limits and Jevons paradox inevitably negates any benefits, but humans keep trying to beat the consequences of dwindling natural resources such as fresh water, fish, minerals, wildlife, biodiversity, land, forests, wetlands, mountainous ecosystems, energy resources, etc. 

The bedrock of our food, clean water and energy is biodiversity, but its loss now rivals the impacts of climate change. Most worrisome are the recent studies indicating that biodiversity loss raises the risk of ['extinction cascades'](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180219155019.htm) and that insect numbers, the base of the terrestrial food chain, are in [steep decline](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature). Our real stock market is crashing before our eyes and with it we will go!!!
