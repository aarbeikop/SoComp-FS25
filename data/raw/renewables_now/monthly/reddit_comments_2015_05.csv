No, we don't. Certainly not 7 billion of us at anything close to an American standard. I could point you to a thousand sources that demonstrate this, but this guy's blog is pretty direct:

>tipping point between collapse and utopia

No. Civilization is not a utopia. It is an omnicidal system of domination based upon the exploitation of nature, nature-based cultures, and the lower classes of the civilized. A paradigm of growth, increasingly magnified social hierarchy, destruction of land bases...the list goes on. These things are all inherent and systemic to the mode of human living we call civilization. This is true of all past civilizations (they've all collapsed) and our global capitalist industrial civilization is just the latest, most virulent strain of this phenomenon.

>we have all the tools we need to fix the majority of our big problems but we seem to be blocked/blind from making the changes we could all do to make a big difference?

You're right; we could physically dismantle industrial civilization right now if we all woke up. But we don't for a variety of reasons.

>sustainable

Sustainable doesn't mean sustaining industrial civilization. Industrial civilization is inherently unsustainable. Asking how we can sustain the unsustainable is a ridiculous question. Sustainable means a way of living that isn't based upon the use of any non-renewable materials.","2015-05-15 16:38:48","39","assman08","1747825709.325801","renewables now","manual"

Over a decade the skyscraper grows and grows and now it houses thousands of offices for hundreds of businesses. Eventually, the wood starts to rot and the skyscraper faces imminent disaster. A new technology - concrete - allows for sturdier foundations that will last decades if not centuries, but the only way of putting the concrete foundations in is to start building the skyscraper from the bottom up again.

I'm not great with analogies but that's really what it is. We've built a global society based on things (e.g. fossil fuels) and done it so heavily that to change these pillars of society is impossible with our current system.","2015-05-15 18:36:39","9","UHM-7","1747825709.3281338","renewables now","manual"

In a sense, yes. Major corps are abandoning the developed countries in favour of developing nations. They don't want to pay taxes here, they don't want to develop infrastructure here, and they certainly don't want to manufacture here. So in that sense we're 'being collapsed'. 

In the larger sense of the civilization, the developing world is only a minor stop-gap on the road to larger decline. ","2015-05-15 17:44:47","8","pherlo","1747825709.329437","renewables now","manual"
"crantc0","t3_362m2j","362m2j","collapse","skeptical","We need redistribution.

Imagine a future when machines are doing all the work, farming, making our phones, clothes, food... everything! Sounds like utopia right? People can focus on fun/knowledge and eat, live etc.

Now picture that with the actual economic system. What would happen? Well it's easy : the companies having those machines will make profit while unemployed people will starve.

We need some way to redistribute wealth in order for humanity to profit from technological advances. If someone find a new way to do something in a more profitable way everyone should benefit from it. This is not what is happening. What is happening is that if someone finds something, they will make profit out of it.

This is good at some point for sure, it stimulates competition and competition stimulate growth. Now the problem is that with the automation of everything, people become less and less useful. Companies are shrinking their numbers of employees.

Look at the bank for examples, do you even go at the counter to take your money? No! You go to an ATM! And what happens to the dude working at the counter? Ok maybe the bank will employ him for something else, but picture what will happen at a larger scale when everyone will be replaced.

Collapse has begun. Replacing people by machine and IA is an easier way to survive for most companies, some of them HAVE to do it in order to survive. Making more people jobless, killing more and more the economy, forcing more companies to cut their expanses by opting for an automated solution...","2015-05-16 02:04:37","5","Extraltodeus","1747825709.331727","renewables now","manual"
"cra6lbv","t3_362m2j","362m2j","collapse","skeptical","There is a collective action problem, a cost distribution problem, and the problem of organization/political will. 

Here's an example: I'm in Kansas. We have a tremendous wind resource here, and pretty good solar potential; a work force that includes lots of engineers, and generally enough infrastructure to make putting in a better electric grid possible. So, first question, who has the power to command or require that we ""transform"" the energy system into something sustainable? 

No individual can pay to transform everything; you'd need everyone to make huge investments. How much would it cost to go from 20% wind power to 40%? 60%? Your baseload power is coal, its disptachable, so you can run it whenever you need it, not just when the wind is blowing or sun shining. Natural gas prices are falling. You have institutions like the State Corporation Commission that regulate prices which you'd have to completely dismantle in order to change their mandate to ensure ""just and reasonable"" prices for power. If you want an ecology based dispatch system instead of a cost based dispatch system. I say this as someone who (desperately) wants to encourage renewable energy and works in the sector; there are institutional barriers to higher deployment that we cannot overcome without a crisis. 

If you want people to drive less, you'll need to raise the cost of gas today. If you tell them that they're causing problems for people tomorrow, they will likely believe you but keep doing it unless you force them to stop. 

Asking people to stop fracking will not work. Suing them for earthquake damages caused by injection wells might. 

Asking people to stop cutting down trees or killing  endangered animals will only be successful if you can make it more expensive or dangerous for them than doing something else. 

There are billions of people. Billions. There's no easy way out of this. 

If you're really worried; buy some farmland that can feed you, drop a well, buy tools, install generation and storage, build a wall around your house and wait for it to fall apart. Otherwise, just do the best you can in a city, like everyone else, and hope that as we slide down hill, it will be slow enough to adapt.

We're doing more than just sustain ourselves, we're growing as a world population.  Some countries growing more than others, for many various reasons, largely in undeveloped/developing nations, where contraceptives might not be as prevalent as a trip to the gas station//kwik-e-mart to get some condoms.

power world times over with renewable energy - the technology is known, sure, but not widely used.  We're quite a ways off from everyone having solar panels on their homes to have energy independence.  Probably also how renewable sources on the small/personal scale don't tend to offer enough to meet the needs of the masses.

language - this is kind of a given when you have a smart phone and the right app(s).  There's still bound to be misunderstandings, and no amount of translation will fix certain political issues where actions speak louder than words (aiding Iran's nuclear program as an example, no amount of ""I'm Sorry"" will really fix the problem other nations see with it unless or until the US backs out of the program).

Feed ourselves - again, arguable.  Depends on the nation in question; there's people starving in Africa, yet we throw tons of food away in the US.  It's more to do with logistics & distribution than actually producing enough of it (for the time being).","2015-05-15 22:16:51","3","Fenriradra","1747825709.3363671","renewables now","manual"
