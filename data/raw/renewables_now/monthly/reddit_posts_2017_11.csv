I don't have any work experience in the energy field as of now. I will really appreciate if someone can shed some light on the following questions. I gave my TOEFL last year and my score was 97 out of 120. Last year I also tried to pick up some computer/programming skills being in bay area but I feel that it is not for me and also I don't want to waste my degrees.

1. How is energy field for jobs in California?
2. Is the energy field accepting to degree's from Europe?
3. What are the possibilities for girl to make her career in HVAC/Energy field here?
4. From my initial research into the energy job market in bay area it looks like most of the jobs are in renewal/solar energy field. Is this correct?
5. I am also considering going for another masters in renewal energy field here if I don't find any jobs. I am thinking to get my second masters in renewal/solar energy. Will this be a good idea?

Any feedback/help/guidance will be really appreciated.
