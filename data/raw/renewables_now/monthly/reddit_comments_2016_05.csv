"d36ianp","t3_4jfxvc","4jfxvc","sustainability","action-oriented","This list is more economic/political than social, but that's mostly because I think most people don't really have the background in the field to understand the issues with any kind of nuance (so the social issues would be mostly solved by more education in my idealistic mind). Politicians are mostly beholden to the will of the people in democratic states, so it follows that education and challenging the propaganda (ie we can power the whole world with X many solar panels and that's all! Nuclear is unsafe and scary!) Nevermind the continued denial of climate change. 

1. We don't have large-scale, economically cost effective storage technology. Renewable energy is intermittent (only when the sun shines and the wind blows). The current electric grid is set up such that SUPPLY must always match DEMAND. So whenever you turn on a light, a power source must be ramped up to meet that new demand. If there's no sun or wind at that particular moment, and no way to store the energy produced by the sun or wind, then the only alternatives are for you to go without light or for a fossil-fuel based source to ramp up. Companies and governments are looking heavily in to R&D and commercialization of these technologies; primarily in trying to figure out good battery chemistries that will deliver reliable charging and discharging at a grid scale. Tesla has already started to implement it's Powerwall battery system in the US though it is far from cost-competitive with some other storage technologies. 
2. Solar and wind don't provide base load power. Base load power are generators that are running all the time, day and night. In the US, most base load power is coal (slowly phasing out as it becomes more expensive that natural gas) and nuclear (though the US has an aging nuclear fleet and hardly any political will to build more reactors). Base power is important because it is the cheapest energy you can supply and is very reliable. Because renewables are intermittent, you cannot count on them to provide base load power without adding on some storage technology. Renewables are close to cost competitive with fossil fuels in some markets, but not when you also have to factor in the ancillary tech needed for them to function like traditional base load power. This is the reason that I'm very disheartened by Europe's general distrust of nuclear power (with the exception of France). Germany's GHG emissions have gone up in recent years because they have decided to shut down their existing nuclear power plants. Guess where their base load power now comes from? Coal. Nuclear is safe, reliable, and cheap, and cleaner than a coal fired power plant and should be part of any reasonable economy's power mix. 
3. Pricing structures. When you put a solar panel on your roof, who pays for that? Electricity is so cheap, that a payback period for the panel is multiple years - there are better investments to be made. Small-scale wind is not worth doing because the power you can generate from a turbine is a function of it's height (taller is better) and the size of it's blade (power output goes as the cube of the radius of the blades). That means bigger is much better - not worth doing at home. But going back to the solar panel example - if you put one on your roof, you may get a benefit in lower costs, and you may even be able to sell energy back to the grid. But your utility still has to pay to maintain all the transmission lines, substations, and base load power. They're simply getting less revenue from you because you're billed on a per-kWh rate. I'll venture to state that we will continue to need power companies in the future, so it is in our best interest to keep them financially solvent. Figuring out how to create a new business model that incorporates distributed energy generation is a big challenge.

Most of these issues are being actively worked, but they do require political will to make them happen. In the US, state regulatory commissions, individual companies, and electric utilities are working together with federal resources like the EPA and Department of Energy to solve these issue, but as you can imagine, each group has conflicting priorities. And that's not even including the climate change deniers and green activists who are upset that these groups aren't doing enough or doing too much. 

If you're looking for resources, GreenTech Media and Utility Dive cover a lot of the news happening in the US on these issues in some detail. Not sure how applicable it would be to the UK.

There's still a part to be played by activism too; all the anti Keystone XL protesters probably played a large part in preventing the building of new infrastructure. But ultimately I think the takeaway is that the adoption of renewables is very complicated, with many stakeholders with individual technical, political and economic challenges. Moving to a low-carbon energy system is going to take time. I would argue that we need to be moving faster, but I recognize that the process is difficult. Figuring out how we can all contribute to helping address the challenges of integrating renewable energy in to our electric grids is hard, but it's one of the best thing we can do from a political perspective to reducing our carbon footprint now and in the future.","2016-05-15 17:36:31","2","[deleted]","1747851400.486024","renewables now","manual"
