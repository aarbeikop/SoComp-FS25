"esclb1q","t3_c6yslk","c6yslk","environment","emotional","It seems that awareness of the climate emergency has exponentially grown in the past year or so, at least where I am.  That’s leading people to take a multitude of actions.  We simply _must_ keep hope alive or no one will _act._

Like WW-II, keeping hope alive for the general civilians was a major part of the victory.  Otherwise the mass mobilization of societies won’t happen.  I think things like the French Resistance, American women working in military factories, Londoners keeping calm during the Blitz, etc. happened because there was _hope_ that if everyone pulled together, they would succeed.  And they did, but not without losses.

I was just at a solar power hour where my fair city is doing everything possible to help people install solar at home. This is notwithstanding a local utility that loves the fuck outta coal and loves to be hostile to solar customers.  But the local government is leading the way to fight back and grow solar, and the meeting was full and people who didn’t look like hippies were all serious about installing enough solar at their home to be net zero annually.

Change is coming.  Renewable energy is a huge part of the mix to decarbonize and it’s cost effective.  So it’s going to happen fast- like the way computers kept getting faster and faster at the turn of the millennium.  This gives me enough _hope_ to keep going.

Find your hope.  Go to r/climateActionPlan if you need inspiration.  And act and do _something_ that moves the cause forward and cultivates hope in yourself.

Edit: misspelled the r/ClimateActionPlan sub name.","2019-06-29 18:18:42","4","Quinniper","1747920961.145186","renewables now","manual"

Extinction Rebellion ain't gonna cut it with civil, non-violent disobedience. We'd need an old fashioned Extinction Revolution with raging mobs carrying torches, storming the contemporary Bastille to get their hands on some serious weaponry and subsequent decapitation of those in charge, expunging their offspring from power and possibly the gene pool because the only thing the monkey cares about is breeding and success of said offspring.

But no mass media would carry it and you'd end up in jail for inciting violence. As if anything ever changed without it in a time span now required. Catch 22.

I believe that Nuclear power is the only way we will get our Energy grid's globally to Zero emissions quickly. 

&#x200B;

We still need to work on all the other sources of Co2, but WE could at least start with the electric grids.  From there we need to work on reducing our Overall Co2 & methane emissions.  

&#x200B;

I am all for Renewables, any energy source that is Near Zero Emission.  but Wind and Nuclear seems to be the best options currently.   We need to hurry up and get people in power across the globe that understand Climate change and know how to proceed.","2019-06-18 20:58:25","16","Icebreaker808","1747921481.092148","renewables now","manual"
"eriqxgv","t3_c256v4","c256v4","collapse","skeptical","I mean, yes, it's sad. Depending on your expectations.

Or is it?

It's funny. The values we decide are universal. The values we decide are somehow built-in to the universe. Does the Earth itself value biodiversity? Of course not. It doesn't value anything. Values are an abstraction. Values are human.

The Earth doesn't care about climate change. 

So we look to our own values, the value of human civilization, or failing that, the value of avoiding die-off, the unimaginable terror and pain it will cause. Brief, yes, but vast. But still, it's funny. Most collapse folks hate the idea of civilization. They *want* it to end. They *want* it to burn. Yet they also want to feel bad about it burning. Quite a moral mess.

Is it tragic?

What is tragedy?

Tragedy is when it could have been some other way, but it is not that way. Missed opportunities. Senseless loss. Avoidable misfortune.

Was this avoidable?

I don't know, but re-reading your post, I think not. We're individually intelligent apes that are collectively no more intelligent than the yeast in a brewing bottle of beer, choking on their own poison as they metabolize sugar into alcohol, completely unable to check their own growth, even if their survival depends on it.

Could it have ended in any other way than this way?

""End"" being quite relative, by the way. Human beings will not go extinct. We will -- with much pain and devastation -- return to something closer to what we were before. An inverted energy and population curve from our rise. From the perspective of most of the human beings who ever lived, industrial civilization was the ""end"" of what it meant to be human -- and our fall will be a return to it. Or as close to a return as might be possible.","2019-06-19 00:41:02","10","mcapello","1747921481.094919","renewables now","manual"
