Let’s say I am wrong and you are right, that AGW is a total hoax. What do we get if we treat it as if it's real? Cleaner air to breath? Cleaner water to drink? Less pollution in the world? People using a lot less gas, saving money from going to Saudi Arabia? More people employed by Solar, Wind and Renewable Energy than coal and gas? Less coal miners dying of black lungs? Less Exxon Valdez and Deep Horizon oil spills? What is so bad about that? But what if you are wrong and I am right, the world will be just as polluted today or worse. And we produce less food. Farmers in Ohio and the Mid West already planted 28% less corns and soy this year due to the flooding. What we are doing now is more important than ever. Join us.

"c8jvos","climate","scientific","Most Impactful Career Paths to Fight Climate Change","I graduated in 2011 with a BS in Applied Physics.  I have been working in Operations for one of the largest residential solar installers in the US for the last 7 years or so.  I am now considering pursuing grad school.  Simply put, my goal is to have the largest possible impact on the fight against climate change.  I am overwhelmed by the different ways to approach this though, education and career-wise.  Some examples of ideas I have considered: PhD in physics/chemistry to research more efficient solar cell materials, law degree to pursue climate policy action, MBA to pursue developments in new tech in the private sector, MS in Engineering to move up in a private company similar to the one I'm currently at... the list goes on!

"cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","It is unfair. We will all die unhappy because 95% of the population is not aware of the collapse.","Inspired by this beautiful [topic by /u/Sabina090705]( https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ceum0y/i_flaired_this_post_coping_because_to_me_its_not/) I decided to pitch in my 2 cents.

I do not live in the United States, I am 10 years younger than the above user (30 yo vs 40yo) and I am afraid. But not afraid of the collapse, or of an authoritarian US or of the ongoing destruction of the planet. I am scared by the simple fact of being unhappy until death comes for me. My whole life I was a pessimist, you know, the typical dude “better be safe than sorry” or “it’s better to be prepared for the worse and be happy when it turns out well”, but never was I so afraid. 

I come from an academic family that is very politic-centric, watches the news and reads whitepapers constantly. In the last 10 years, I finished 3 master degrees, learned 3 foreign languages and started a family. In comparison, you may say I’m well off, no debt, no illness and a pretty nice “social parachute”. But that’s all lies. Lies told by politicians how well we have, how we should be grateful and enjoy the meme/movies/eating out. How we will enjoy our retirement. But I know that we current state of affairs, everything I do, like savings, being a responsible buyer will be useless in 10 years. To be honest, the grey mass of uneducated/carpe diem people that live by maxing CC will be far better than I am. At least they are enjoying themselves now and I in the meantime I’m worrying for the future.

> First small digression: I lived in Poland for quite some time. The current polish govt is pro-nationalist, is destroying the rule of law left and right, is pro-catholic, doesn't care about the environment and is buying votes by having a ""great"" social plan. Just to show you how Poland is fucked, almost 50% of citizens between 18 and 65 are not working, there's 4M of Ukrainian migrants in Poland and with an average salary of 3000 PLN net (around 800 EUR) the govt. decides to give 500 PLN per child every month. [My gilded comment about the current situation in Poland](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cb3yfo/poland_to_eliminate_income_tax_for_all_workers/etdpac7/). How do you sustain such a country when 100% of your powergrid is dependent on Russian Oil and  on the import of power from Germany and Sweden? You just can't. There's no plan to build any wind farm, solar panel farm or nuclear plant. And for some amazing reason, the housing market in Poland exploded (it's impossible to buy a flat) and every one is somehow ""living the dream"".

When I still had friends, I tried to talk to them about climate changes. That half of all the CO2 emissions were done post 1990, that rising temperature will have a cascading effect on all the power plants and blackouts will be frequent. The equator belt will be hit by such a heat waves and a wetbulb event that the ensuing African, Indian or S.Am. migration will be the downfall of the US and EU. Already when traveling in Greece, Italy, France or Germany you see plenty of Africans in the streets not working and just “being there”. Now imagine this coupled with a blackout, water crisis and crop destruction. It is an apocalypse. 

> Second Small digression, Referring to the above post in the first paragraph – I totally agree that closing and guarding the border is not a solution. The isolationism coupled with nationalism policy never worked and always sparked devastating wars. But accepting everyone is also not wise, we should be helping the migrants by having a plan.

Anyway, there are not enough resources to build all the renewable electric powerplants and grid to sustain the current energy needs of the world. Moreover, China, India, and all the developing countries won’t be so eager to implement western ecological rules. Drinking water shortages will be a daily occurrence, revolts and rebellions will happen every day. Do you see what’s going on in France? They have a weekly yellow vest protest for the last 6 months just because Macron wanted to RAISE THE TAX ON FUEL. I mean… sometimes I fell like living in on another planet (third disgression: [How many liters of fuel can you buy with the average salary](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8pc94k/how_many_liters_of_diesel_can_be_purchased_with/) France: 1457 liters, Poland: 699. And the French have the audacity to protest? Why Poland is not up in flames?). And I won’t even mention the epidemics, the rising sea levels, Russia trying to meddle into every country and create chaos [my gilded comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cbja9x/some_of_putins_top_cops_are_mobsters_even_kgb/etgcv3l/), the wars sparked by the lack of resources (read about the Indus river threaty and how it will impact Pakistan if India decides to reroute the river. Or about Sudan and Egypt) and the automation that will take our jobs. The capitalist overlords are just waiting for automation to be able to show better quarterly revenues to their shareholders. [John Oliver on Automation](https://youtu.be/_h1ooyyFkF0). About 8M of bread earners in the US will lose their jobs in the next few years. 3M truck drivers, 3M working in retail, 1M working in warehouses, 1M of office admin. That's 8M*4 (a typical family of 4)= 32M without anything to eat. That's almost 10% of the US.

On another note, my grandparents were Polish (Bless their souls), they witnessed WWII first hand. I can still hear the stories they would tell me when I was younger. Of the time when my grandma as a little girl had to run in a field with her whole village because the Stuka’s where strafing it. And then a year or two later, to hide in barns because Russians were raping whole villages. Or of my grandpa fighting in the Warsaw uprising on ’44 as a young boy. War is terrible and war brings the worst in us. That’s why, our grandparents, when they came home from this war or the following ones, were not preoccupied with the climate change. They wanted the best for them and their children by building a home, having a car, being able to travel. We can all understand it somehow that the terrors of war were so profound that CO2 – something you can’t even see – was not on their priority list. 

But when the Boomers went on a crazy spending spree they left us with nothing. The minimum wage in the US should be 4x higher to match the minimum wage of ’60. It is harder and harder to find work because of automation. The population of every country is getting older and older and fewer kids are born. [My post about economiccollapse]( https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/ceenp0/something_to_think_about_the_current_state_of/)

And my hard to swallow pill is the fact that everyone around me is happy and I’m not. Just because I know 10x more than them I will die unhappy and afraid. They live their life, they post on Instagram pictures from Tokyo or Maldives, they are building houses, buying new cars and spending, spending, spending. Some of them will watch and repost a Vox or Vice video about climate change and that’s it. It is far more important for them to watch the latest Stranger thing or to badmouth a colleague at work to get a promotion. I don't have a car, nor a house, nor spending thousands on holidays. I try to live responsibly but I see it is pointless.

We are living in a dystopia where the whole society is telling us “work, save, and at the ripe age of 65, you will retire and travel the world” or “Study STEM, work a lot and retire early at the age of 40 or 45”. But what if you won’t make it even until 45? What if there will be such a strong recession or war that everything you saved during your lifetime will be erased? What's the point of working or trying to be a better human or trying to learn a new craft if everything is pointless.

Please, I really would like to bank on the fact that I know (knowledge is power, isn't it?) what’s happening. How to make enough money now to be still able to enjoy the last years that we have on this earth? I would hate to die in a couple of years knowing that all my /dumb/ friends enjoyed life. I was the one saving but in the end we all died thanks to them and their peers spending.

PS: the sad part is that the general population is more and more “woke”, r/worldnews is almost a copy of r/collapse. More and more people are being conscious of what’s happening, but they are still hopeful that we can change the direction we are heading. If more people are conscious then the collapse will happen sooner than later. More people will start panicking, sparkling rebellions and revolutions. So the collapse maybe sooner than we think.

And that's exactly what I would like to do.

Edit : when I talk with my SO, they don't want to hear about it. my SO asks me to change topic. When I talk with my parents they tell me that everyone dies and it doesn't matter if we die from climate change or something else because all life is precious and we should live in the moment. So they ask me to stop reading about collapse. My in-laws are trying to tell me to trust in God and that everything will be fine.....

"cdvuvb","collapse","skeptical","The life, times and understandings of a r/collapse reader explained...","For anyone who's been on collapse years, we've seen the stages of r/Collapsers.

It's not based on the stages of grief, which people can cycle around with each new visit.

The long term informational situation of r/Collapsers follows a common trend, from the new arrival worried about melting ice, up to the seasoned r/Collapser who inevitably leaves the group for more suitable alternatives - such as r/scrungycats/

If you follow the ""enlightening"" - you see it happen in waves... and it's happened several times over the years to big groups as large influxes of new arrivals all reach similar ""enlightenment"" milestones at the same time.

Here I outline them:

**Stage one**: The ice is melting, CO2 warms the air, water level rises. 2 degrees isn't just ""a slightly warmer day outside"".

**Stage two**: Doom if we hit 2 degrees.              
We're at 1 degree now / No we're at 1.5 degree's measured from before modern agriculture. Lets go green/lets seize production/lets plant trees. Carbon taxes!

**Stage three**: Random arguments about solar, renewables, the continued ever faster rise of CO2 despite ALL attempts to slow it. The realisations that politicians say one thing to the public (GREEN!), and help polluting business grow. The realisation that we're on track to crash before we sort out a sustainable green economy.         

**Stage four**: This can happen around stages 2 and 3 - discovering the massive, incredible, huge sizes of machines needed to power the world on renewables, suck up CO2 from the atmosphere, keep the fertile soil healthy...

When stage 4 is combined with the others, people usually see the situation as hopeless. For example THE ENTIRE PLANETS production facilities act as a CO2 engine while driving the economy of everyone.         
Sucking CO2 out of the air requires the SAME SCALE but in reverse, AND it ""creates"" nothing, but CO2 in a form that needs to be got rid of.

Finally, everyone's sighing at the inevitable slow decline.  
Then BOOM!         

**Stage 5 of understanding**: If we turn our CO2 engines off BEFORE we've made our immense CO2 sucking machines, then the immense dimming of all the pollution emitted in the world hits us in less than a year, and we raise at least a degree.

In 1 year of things getting bad enough that we lose manufacturing across the world, the temperature rises ANOTHER degree, taking us to 2.5 degrees. (We're at 1.5 NOW)

At THAT point MANY scientists agree that 3, 4 and 5 is inevitable.

*(It's like discovering the way out of a man-trap that's cutting into your legs will inevitably set off the one that you didn't know was around your neck.)*

The methane clathrates melt, the permafrost melts and rots, heatwaves, rain bombs, and tornadoes all increase massively.

Oh yeah - add on the SLOW CO2 warming effect. It goes on for centuries. Not read about how warm 430PPM CO2 is when it reaches the hottest it can get at that level? It's a worrying read.

2300 would be around 8 degrees, civilisation long gone, and the rusting machines of our world turning to dust.         
The Titanic is half gone, and it's only been underwater 100 years. Thousands of tons of ocean liner.

In 200 years, all we'll have of this global world are a couple of huge dams, Pyramids, and Göbekli Tepe.

At this point the r/Collapser generally leaves for other subs.

And a new wave of kids arrive worrying at the melting glaciers they've read about.","2019-07-16 11:35:47","62","26","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/cdvuvb/the_life_times_and_understandings_of_a_rcollapse/","True","SarahC","1747923150.8030741","renewables now","manual"
