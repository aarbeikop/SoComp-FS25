"9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","What They Never Explained...","What people who insist that climate change is threatening enough to warrant aggressive policy changes have never sufficiently explained, is why it would be plausible that a belief that happens to precisely fit their emotional needs also happens to be true. Climate change alarmism looks and feels exactly like half a dozen former environmental scares, that all turned out to be wrong. So we can conclude, that many people have an emotional need to believe in such scares, and that such beliefs are exceptionally plausible to them. If we find a belief that many people strongly crave, the most likely explanation is that they believe it because they like the belief, not because it is true. That reality should oblige the emotional needs of the early 21st century green person is highly unlikely. It rather seems that global warming is a psychologism. A certain portion of the population simply wakes up with a sensation that doom is imminent, and then they come up with reasons for why this feeling is justified. The one common thread of the green era was that the world was always supposed to be ending, it was always urgent and hysterical, they just now and then changed the reason of why exactly it is ending. All these environmental scares are structurally replaceable, and seem to run the same emotional habit. The plausible explanation of these observations is not that greens must be right about the last reason they propose, but that they have some internal reason for believing in immanent doom, and then find rationalizations for it. Even traditional religion is functionally the same belief system and has been found to run on the same cognitive hardware as environmental beliefs. Warmists certainly behave like religionists, it is very important to them that everyone accepts their belief. Climate change has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations, always changing the story under the same label as old theories get refuted. The ""consensus"" thus does not confirm catastrophic global warming, but can refer to acceptance of any of the many theories with that name. Yet is always taken to confirm the current iteration of catastrophic global warming.

Edit: I'm throwing this out as a challenge. If you want to convert me, then explain it to me. I have heard plenty of the usual hostile talking points, and that's not what I'm looking for. Don't just request me to justify my claims, or nitpick at my arguments, and claim that me not making good enough arguments somehow makes your belief true. This is an opportunity to the believer, to explain to me, the disbeliever, why your belief is plausible.","2018-11-05 12:39:04","0","21","0.3","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9ud5pr/what_they_never_explained/","True","taylor-4","1747903247.294891","renewables now","manual"
"a1le90","climate","scientific","Fuck the bullshit! Save the world!! There’s no more time to bitch.","When you start to dig into what projects and changes and policies and technologies are being implemented in progressive areas of the World you start to understand how swiftly and powerfully we’re moving in the right direction. Ignorant nationalism and all it pretends to stand for is a temporary manifestation conjured by nothing more than fear. Ignore it and all its misguided messages, and move forward with confidence and collective ownership of our future. Don’t ever let yourself fall into a victim mindset.

California has decoupled GDP from oil and coal proving an aggressive environmental shift is economical at a global level. The implications of that are amazing. We have hundreds of major companies and universities and cities and states and countries proclaiming and moving towards carbon neutrality and carbon freedom RIGHT NOW. The world is taking initiative and the people are acting locally. This is the future of all our systems, and the organic model that best mimics nature. 

The next 100 years (the rest of OUR lifetimes) will see the biggest infrastructure projects in history. There’s never been a better opportunity to reimagine our world as the safe, healthy, beautiful place we want it to be, and rebuild the entire planet in that image. Renewables have the power to greatly decentralize and distribute wealth rather than polarize and concentrate it. Same for organic farming, asset sharing, decentralized currencies, industrial automation, artificial intelligence, brilliant new economic models, and on and on and on.

In aggregate, I believe the vast majority of future leaders understand the mistakes of the past and are going to improve on what the previous generation mostly did its best to build right. Don’t lay blame. Take responsibility and move forward. 

We can’t ignore of the difficult and deadly global changes we’ve already initiated, but this is our fucking planet and we’re not going to let it go completely to shit. The generations that understands the science and understands the power of unity and globalism is coming of age and coming into power all over the world. This means us, right here, right now!!

Stand up and tell everyone what’s happening to our planet. Make decisions with the planet in mind first. Don’t take shit from idiots. This is not a debate. There is not a lack of consensus. It’s our world now, and the final death grasp of ignorant members of the old guard is upon us.

Must we solve the problems of the past and clean up our planet? Yes! Can we do it before it’s too late? Unquestionably. Will we create the world WE have all been taught to imagine for the future of humanity? Fuck yes!!","2018-11-29 21:03:35","92","33","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/a1le90/fuck_the_bullshit_save_the_world_theres_no_more/","True","grandmah","1747903343.1817632","renewables now","manual"
"a0x66h","collapse","skeptical","all this talk about how it’s not the governments fault global warming is acellerating and people need to make better individual choices and/or decrease the population is wrong.","the government has the money and power to completely transform our energy system. the technology is there and it can be done. we could all be driving electric/hydrogen cars right now if our government subsidized it. we could be flying electric plane engines.  all of this electric energy can be supplied through renewable and fusion tech.

it doesn’t happen because most of our politicians are paid off by fossil fuels.

so just remember that before you blame the population at large.

it can be fixed , but our governments choose not to for short term profit.

thanks for listening to this public service announcement. have a good day.","2018-11-27 17:49:23","75","52","0.77","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/a0x66h/all_this_talk_about_how_its_not_the_governments/","True","Correctthecorrectors","1747904566.665466","renewables now","manual"
