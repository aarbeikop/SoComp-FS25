And still my parents got big gas guzzling vehicles because they were more comfortable in them and I think also because they thought if climate change was really a threat then we'd be doing something about it. 

And then there was a time around the late 90s where even smart conscious people thought that maybe climate change wasn't really happening or it wasn't going to be that bad. 

I moved to Chicago in the early 00s and rode my bike/public transit, didn't have a car was a vegetarian etc... But somewhere around 2014 I gave up and I started to have that thought in the back of my consciousness that - if it was really this bad we'd be doing more. It was at that same time that I was graduating with a degree in chemical engineering and started working in the medical device field. Still supporting climate change action, but just not on my mind so much...

Then I decided to actually read the IPCC's Oct 2018 report and study it... Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! 

My fucking in-laws can't even eat a meal without bitching about paper straws how the fuck are we going to convince them that they can't eat a lb of beef with every fucking meal???

1. You need a close relationships with friends or family. 
2. You need a sense of contributing to the community.

I mean. Why be envious of idiotic fellow consumers when you can feel the epic unfairness that our species has unloaded on the entire fucking planet. /s

In all seriousness, though, there’s no one “right” way to feel. There is no precedence that I am aware of in our collective culture, literature or art that could be a guide on how best to react to our deliberate, unthinking killing-off of an entire biosphere, the only one we have ever known. This is, emotionally speaking, completely unchartered territory. We may be aware of the five stages of grief, but, again, that was studied in terms of known situations; it wasn’t framed for the death and destruction of absolutely everything we hold dear. So who’s to say what the right way to react is?

The best we can do is to live with kindness, compassion, courage. And be nice to each other - even to the assholes revving their gas guzzlers. Maybe forgive them for they know not what they do?

"eu9r2sf","t3_cf7msp","cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","I will not die unhappy. We are all slaves to something. You Just have to figure out what exactly makes you happy and to hell with all the collapse issues. Because you are right. Most people don't know about the issues of this world, nor would they care or even believe of the issues in the first place assuming they knew. So just do what makes you feel alive. If that is alerting people of collapse, and teaching people, then all the power to you. Otherwise, not to be a defeatist, but it is just not feasible to turn all the governments or even general populice around.

Everything ends eventually, and that is okay.","2019-07-20 02:05:18","1","FenrirHere","1747922524.8336608","renewables now","manual"

"eua2ejf","t3_cf7msp","cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","> The minimum wage in the US should be 4x higher to match the minimum wage of ’60.

Just gonna point out -- minimum wage in 1960 was $1.00; [adjusted for inflation](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1&year1=196001&year2=201906) that's $8.74 in June 2019. US minimum wage is currently $7.25 -- $8.74 is only 1.2x greater, not 4x. Not sure where you're getting your figures from here.","2019-07-20 04:55:28","1","TrekkiMonstr","1747922524.836374","renewables now","manual"
"euacmch","t3_cf7msp","cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","They say that in the world there is both *yin and yang*. But it looks like the battle of ""good and evil"" is out of balance. Why else does negative usually win? Also human mind is so easily manipulated that we end up with vast majority of people (90% or whatever percentage you give it) following whatever current power or major trend we have. This enables ""negative"" power to rule.

Is it all unfair? Well, maybe. But then again it is what it is. Humans are who they are, as flawed as they are. In the end in nature there is no 'fairness' or 'unfairness'. There are just natural processes. Big animals eat small ones. If something is out of balance, it will be forced back to balance. Humanity has gone way out of balance, we will be forced to get out of this planet, so Earth can get back to balance. 

Nature doesn't give assessments of ""good"" and ""bad"". But it reacts if harm is done to it.","2019-07-20 08:29:57","1","202020212022","1747922524.837976","renewables now","manual"

Case in point: guy in the white house. Why? While I studied at the university, people never read their books they just cheated off people and hot answers straight from prof exams. I never did that and I always graduated with honors. I learned a lot too from all the reading. One of my prof said once you get into an elite school, there is no way you can flunk out of those schools. They don't allow it.
