I would suggest to you that appearance of similarity regarding other ""incorrect"" environmental issues most likely is due to your receiving information primarily from sources which present it as similar to other environmental issues, which they then declare (correctly or not) were wrong.

> And even global warming has not been the same theory over time, but has gone through numerous iterations 

Nope, it's been the same for over one hundred years: CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases warm the planet's surface. Therefore increasing CO2 warms the planet's surface.","2018-11-05 14:12:42","5","skeeezoid","1747903249.7304478","renewables now","manual"

"e93zrv7","t3_9ud5pr","9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","You're right it has happened numerous times. And you are correct nature has bounced back. However, all those events took place over several thousand years.

This even will take place over several hundred. Neither nature nor organisms can adapt over a course of hundreds of years. If they do bounce back, it will be a drastically smaller amount of flora and fauna. If that happens, how do you prepare to feed the vast majority of people? How do you ensure the ecosystem stays stable?

That's the main focus: thousands of years yes you can adjust but hundreds, nature certainly cannot. I know this first hand. Snooker season was basically canceled in fort Myers in 2010 or 11 because a quick spike in temperature killed over 800 of this fish. I remember because it was a major news story. 

As I said nature can adapt but it cannot adapt in a short amount of time and that is what is occurring now. It is a normal process, but it is occurring TOO quickly compared to the past.","2018-11-05 18:51:32","1","KarakitIshtari","1747903249.740554","renewables now","manual"
"e94mijo","t3_9ud5pr","9ud5pr","climatechange","action-oriented","I notice lately there is a lot of emphasis on the rate of increase of global temperature. 

We only have records for the last 170 years or so. Initially these were very scant records of global climate. Now we have data from the best available instruments. As good as the data is it represents only a small sample of the reality of the climate. 

Pre 1850 we have only proxies. The data is not a continuum but averages over a time period. The further back the greater the time period of averaging.

Averaging data removes the peaks and troughs. Rates of change can only be determined by that of the average. Fluctuations within the averaging range can not be determined.","2018-11-05 23:57:55","1","NewyBluey","1747903249.743149","renewables now","manual"

I’m sorry but this is misleading. California has done this by shifting its fossil fuel generation to surrounding states, whose carbon emissions have increased. It’s an accounting trick. 

Similar story in the UK. 25% emissions cut from 1990 to 2012. Except when you look at imports, you find the cut is only 7%. The move of massive amounts of manufacturing from the UK to Germany and China obscures the fact that we’re still causing nearly the same amount of carbon to be released.

Formally law decisions will get advised with some scientific insights and probably policy effects, but I can assure you that most politicians aren't intrigued or influenced by physics or any other scientific branch. It is safe to say they even lack the fundamentals. There is a gaping hole between scientists and legislators (aka businessmen?)

Also, the process of legislation stems from the 18th or 19th century (Montesquieu dramatique) and it is safe to say that it is outdated.

Shut up bootlickers. 

Also we WILL have to give up enough energy to cease most mass production, transportation, other large scale applications. But if other more environmentally prudent materials can be identified I'm sure small scale electronics will survive in some form, as well as people powering small consumer goods from ""the old world"". The mechanical energy of your body can easily be converted and power electronics that require a couple hundred watts if you have the right mechanics and electronics to properly convert the energy to the standard required by the device. And that's assuming all other energy sources are lost after some sort of shit hitting the fan event.
