The working class is told that they get ""one person one vote"" yet we see companies pouring money into politics effectively voting millions of times by 1) manufacturing people's consent towards voting for people they otherwise wouldn't (see Noam Chomsky), and 2) flat out changing politicians' stances from what they originally claimed. These energy companies are doing exactly this. Once you see that these politicians' generally don't *actually* believe the garbage they're saying, you can tell that our politics are essentially just the corporations governing us. I do hope you see the possible ineffectiveness of ""VOTE"" in the face of how fake the democratic parts of our society are - it's the reason why MLK was part of a (widely disliked) movement, not a campaign to get out the vote, and it's the reason why a group like Extinction Rebellion is similarly causing economic disruption by blocking traffic etc. and making demands.

They have done investigating on these phenomena, and tried to come up with a solution to a real life problem that relates to them.

A group of girls were interested about a potato battery experiment they saw on a YouTube-video as they were doing their research. I've tried to help them as much as I can, but a question I can't answer them yet is as follows; How many potatoes would it take to produce enough power to power up a household, or even a fully fledged potato powered power plant (that's their company)? This is the question they are trying to answer with their research. On Friday we'll see what kinds of readings can we get from a potato if we hook it up with copper and zinc plates.

My view is that large scale energy storage implemented specifically for the purpose of grid management for renewable energy ie saving excess production for when production slows, these storage solutions should be as 'green' as the sources themselves.  

My understanding is that ion batteries deteriorate, become waste, and can pollute, and processes involved, such as those for the mining of the materials, can also have negative impact on the environment. 

Is there a big enough push for alternatives such as pumped hydro? Hydraulic hydro? Compressed air storage? Are there drawbacks, specifically with concerns to their being 'green', that are being overlooked?

Do you think ion batteries will one day be made redundant or do you think they will always prevail at the portable/small scale at least?

I more or less agree with many things you've said. One thing I would add is that I think they have already been geo-engineering covertly, however not enough impact while hidden, it's merely slowing things down a bit (or perhaps it's just futile too and they know it, so maybe they know that's all they can do and already are doing - slowing it down)

Maybe there are more extreme measures that could be taken in that regard, remains to be seen.

Regardless of the fact it might have catastrophic unexpected side-effects, it is the only way. It is one of the options available. We may end up taking it, but that can only happen after a widespread acceptance of the true severity of the crisis. The other option is to simply accept we are in the early stages of an unstoppable mass extinction of species and a major die-off of humans, due both to catastrophic and irreversible climate change and a plethora of other human-created ecological disasters.

Great post, and I agree with the overall analysis. But I believe it is more likely we are going to end up with [A third option.](https://imgur.com/nV0Kgzz) (Pretend it doesn't say Mars though. More like the deserts of Ontario or something.)

We'll likely try geoengineering once we experience the loss of control in earnest, but how long can we keep it up with a civilization that is crumbling even without climate change?

To be fair this isn't really an accurate description of zoos.

"ella77b","t3_bg947z","bg947z","collapse","skeptical","I live in a very rural area, too. I was just thinking this morning that there is a surprising dearth of rabbits and squirrels this year. I’m used to seeing them all over the place, including my local roadways, this time of year. This year I’ve seen maybe 3 squirrels, and no rabbits at all. I did find one large black snake in a tarp, as I was uncovering part of my old herb bed. I was pretty excited to see it. I always have been excited to find critters who have seen fit to live close to me. 

Possums have often come to my porch to look for my compost bucket. I hang it from a hook in my porch ceiling, but possums can climb up there and get right in the bucket and root around for snacks. (I don’t mind. I’m happy to see them!) This year, though, there have so far been none. 

I also haven’t heard the packs of coyotes yipping nearby like normal. I’ve been naively attributing this to a new neighbor who has loud dogs. 

And of course, as lots of people have noticed, there are few insects. Even at night. My property has fortunately been covered in butterflies and several varieties of bees, but I find myself wondering how many there are in this area. I suspect I’m one of very few people in my county who postpone mowing and who don’t spray pesticides. 

I live near streams, creeks, and rivers. I wonder how aquatic species are doing, and what the water quality is like, but I can’t bear to check. 

I do hear songbirds, but it isn’t the same cacophony I grew up with. I live in the woods, so there should be plenty, but.... Most of the birds I see are the scavenger species.
