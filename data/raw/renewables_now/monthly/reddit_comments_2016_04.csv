"d1qlh47","t3_4dfzpl","4dfzpl","science","scientific","Hi Dr. Wissinger,

I took your Ochem 2 and Ochem lab classes a few years ago, and  I just wanted to thank you for helping me learn to love Organic chemistry as more than just a bunch of stuff to memorize. I just needed someone to show me how it could be fun and interesting rather than an oppressive body of knowledge that one had to memorize.

It was during your Ochem 2 and Ochem lab classes Organic chemistry went from a class I feared and loathed to a class I loved. Both your enthusiasm and passion for the subject made it much easier to learn and to this day I love O chem and do my best to foster a similar interest in Organic chemistry. 

To ask a question: I remember our experiment with PLA (polylactic acid) back when I took your course and I was wondering if there has been much progress with that polymer. I know they tried using it with the sunchip bags a few years ago but the bags were super loud and not very popular as a result. The U however, I believe, has been using PLA plastics for a while with no problems so I'm not sure why the sunchip bags caused such a problem. 

Do you know anything about that situation and why PLA can seemingly be used for beverage cups and other plastics with no problems but the sunchip bags were a major failure?","2016-04-05 12:39:43","27","Wariya","1747847766.4037278","renewables now","manual"

"d1qmiym","t3_4dfzpl","4dfzpl","science","scientific","Hi Jane.  Thanks for doing an AMA here.  I teach high school chemistry in China.  There are absolutely no reagent disposal guidelines here, and most MSDS defer to ""local regulations"".  So it is not generally effective to have students research safe disposal (in their second language, English).  Even toxic waste companies are not trusted, and have been found to charge fees to simply trash heavy metal salts in neighboring provinces.  So it is really up to individual labs to dispose of our chemicals safely.  Most other western teachers I speak to in Shanghai have an ever-growing stash of dried salts with nowhere to put them.  This is beyond my knowledge and education.  Most local Chinese schools here in Shanghai put *everything* down the drain with plenty of water.  Last year we put a stop to a locally-driven benzene lab for the entire school in a closed room.  Progress must come from the bottom up here. 

So I have been researching projects such as students making their own atomizers out of soda cans and whatnot.  I want to know if you can help me (and China) find ways to deal with high-school chemistry waste on-site, either through more green labs, or through effective disposal education systems.

Please forgive my naivety in this issue; it's often a bit of the blind leading the blind out here.","2016-04-05 13:14:04","15","[deleted]","1747847766.40847","renewables now","manual"

"d1qmlj2","t3_4dfzpl","4dfzpl","science","scientific","Hi there, I was wondering about how scientists come up with green methodologies for existing processes. I'm not sure if I am phrasing it correctly, but the green chemistry reaction scheme seems simpler than the original. 

Take for example, the [Aqueous Passerini Reaction](http://www.chm.uri.edu/bdeboef/chm292/Passerini.pdf), whose original reaction would have taken large amounts of dichloromethane, and a day, and high heat (200^o C); compared to just using water, where one can complete it in half an hour at room temperature. It seems.... odd that we have to go back to plain simple water. 

I did that experiment in high school, and also completed a green chemistry research project where the novel idea for the research is to change the solvent, just to water(again!). The greener process was also more efficient. 

Hence, even though I have been exposed to green chemistry as above, I still don't really get what the research process in green chemistry is like? I'd like to continue on doing chemistry research in university but green chemistry is now like a weird topic for me.
