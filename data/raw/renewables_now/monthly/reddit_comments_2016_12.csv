If survival of extinction level events is a measure of success, there are some organisms that have us beat hands down. I'd put my money on tardigrades over humans.

Evolution happens by a roll of the dice. Random mutations in DNA. A mutant that has increased chance of survival is more likely to survive. Somewhere, a proto monkey mutated resulting in a larger brain, and it had access to the omega 3 fatty acids (DHA) required to build out that brain. This boost of intelligence granted that monkey a better chance of survival and it's DNA propagated. Every successful mutation increases the chances of DNA propagation. The turtle has it's shell, the lion it's claws, the cheetah it's speed, the human monkey it's brains. At first glance, it seems that intelligence is the ultimate roll of the dice, the trump card of humanity; and yet the lowly tardigrade has a better chance of propagating it's DNA for longer than the human. We have the same purpose as any animal, which is to propagate our DNA. The thing that sets us apart is our intelligence. We are here to exploit our gigantic noggins in order to procreate and propagate our DNA. We are animals. Whether we have evolved to survive the next extinction level event remains to be seen.

Plants and algae both generate and consume oxygen. When it's dark, they switch from producing oxygen, to consuming it. I don't know the ratio off the top of my head, but I'm idly wondering if a supervolcano or large asteroid pushed enough ash into the atmosphere, if oxygen levels would drop drastically as plants and algae became net consumers of oxygen.

Oxygen gear will be needed for emergencies and wiring outside the stabilized enclosure.

Food is a problem. It can be stored to get a head start.  It can be grown but meeting the caloric needs of contemporary humans at photosynthetic efficiency within an enclosure will very challenging.  There should be ways to convert electrical energy directly (""electrosynthetically"") into food.

Did You Forget About That For A Minute?**

.....

""WASHINGTON—Saying that despite the possibility you may have briefly been able to distract yourself from the incontrovertible fact by browsing the internet, hanging out with friends, reading, working out, or via some other diversion, sources confirmed Friday that you are still going to die one day and there is nothing you can do to prevent it.

Experts wondered if perhaps you had momentarily forgotten about that—forgotten that one day, you will be dead for all of eternity.

“At some point, you—the person reading this article right now—will simply cease to exist,” said numerous sources, who repeatedly emphasized that whether or not you’re considering your own death at any given moment has no bearing on its inevitability. “It could be today; it could be 70 years from now. The fact remains that one minute, you will be a living, breathing, conscious being with ideas and feelings and opinions and sensations, and the next, you will be nothing. Quite literally nothing.”

“And then that’s it,” experts continued. “Forever.”

At this point, sources asked if you had actually considered how long, exactly, forever is.

Numerous experts also explained to reporters how, after you have died, it will require only the most infinitesimally negligible portion of the ensuing span of time before everything you’ve ever accomplished, said, experienced, or felt is entirely forgotten—completely eradicated without even the smallest trace left behind.

Sources hastened to add that such a state of nonexistence is irreversible and will continue on infinitely, and questioned whether that was something you were currently contemplating.

“Just think—no matter how big or small or good or bad you perceive them to be, all of the choices you make during your life are, in the overall scheme of things, utterly meaningless,” sources said. “Because someday, your heart will stop beating, and blood and oxygen will no longer reach your brain, and every single memory and thought you’ve ever had will disappear and never, ever come back. That will happen to you.”

The same sources went on to question whether you fully perceived the inevitability of your own death, and not simply as a mere abstraction, but rather as the concrete, unavoidable, steadily approaching reality that it is. Indeed, these sources urged you to stop and look at your hands for a moment—really look at them, right now—and consider how they will one day rot away entirely—flesh, blood, cartilage, bone; all of it, completely gone—in the days and months and years and millennia after you have been fully and eternally extinguished from existence.

Expressing concern that you may have somehow been able to forget that you’re careening ever closer toward your own demise even while reading this sentence, sources reconfirmed that one day, you will be nothing and there will be nothing, and you will not even be aware that there is nothing.

“Are you thinking about that now?” experts asked. “Like, right now?”

Furthermore, sources added that even if you stopped reading well before this paragraph and never acknowledged the truths affirmed in this article, this would not, as if by magic, prevent you from one day being dead until the end of all time.

“It should also be noted that everyone you’ve ever known and loved is going to die, too,” experts continued. “Your mother will die; your father will die; your friends will die; your significant other will die; and so will every person you have ever seen or spoken to, or will ever meet—or never meet, for that matter. Just like you, they’ll all be gone, insensate unendingly forever and ever afterward. Have you thought about that recently?”

Experts concluded by noting that this will continue to be the case tomorrow, the next day, and every day after that until a particular day—which will be an actual, real calendar date in the future—when this inevitably happens to you. You.""

No.

That's not the way it works. Not at all.

We've diverted a small portion of the energy we derive from burning fossil fuels as fast as we possibly can (I do think it is in many ways an end in itself - the shiny, plastic crap we seem to prize so highly is just some sort of byproduct - a token that validates our raw consumption,) into building some renewablez, but they're (seemingly deliberately) designed to be short-lived, even in operation are often reliant on regular (if not continual,) fossil fuel inputs, and will all wear out in a couple of decades anyway and need to be replaced with another round of (even more) expensive fossil fuel inputs and resource raping (if that's even still possible then.)

This will just give them one more excuse to keep the fossil fuels burning for longer.

The true solution is unappealing, but simply this:

Stop. Burning. Shit. Now.

All of it. Just stop.

Learn to live with less.

> The remarkable pace of innovation will have at least some effect on the shape and size of our carbon pulse – I do hope it is to the good.

Sadly it won't be, and can't be. It is precisely the ""remarkable pace of innovation"" and our incontinent industriousness that drives the destruction.

The only way out of this madness is to just stop doing this crazy shit. We should have stopped doing this crazy shit centuries ago (when we still could have without killing us all,) but we didn't.

But that's not going to happen until reality forces us to, because now we've ratcheted ourselves so far up the progress ladder, that we recognise that a fall from this height would kill us all (or at least a sufficiently huge proportion of us to make provoking collapse an unappealing prospect for the majority of sheeple,) and make life a good deal less comfortable for any survivors.

No, technology and progress and growth are not, and never will be the solution. They are the very crux of the problem, and the more of them we get, the fuckeder we inevitably become (and with us, all other life on this once magnificent planet.)

It is only fudging or discounting the costs and energy flows of our technological society that permits this delusion to persist that somehow we can beat the laws of thermodynamics.

Science has laid bare the consequences, and politicians have finally listened. You may find the policy changes meagre, but they matter and they will grow. Also, we can’t deny that we’ve had a pulse of innovation including efficient and cheap renewable energy, power reduction of appliances, electric cars, “sustainable” building materials, and so on. It’s not enough to stop the warming, but it’s not bad.

This is just not factual at all, it is just hopium and speculation at best. There is no incentive for countries to stop deforestation, mineral mining, intensive agriculture and animal farming. The problem is not global warming because as you said those consequences are far away. The problem will be running out of fresh water sources and fertile soil, running out of oil and precious minerals to build solar panels and the such, also no oil=no infraestructure as a whole. Besides, the third world will continue to develop and increase its footprint and even if the developed countries suddenly become ""green"" (There is no such thing) the carbon footprint will be inherited by South America, India, etc. Sorry to break it to you, but there will be no miracle leapfrogging into clean energy.

I'd recommend you take a look at these articles. Renewables are a fantasy, as well as any form of sustainable development. The only way for us to stop being the cancer of our planet would be to ditch civilization as a whole.

Well excuse me for being ~~sentimental~~ nostalgic for this version of the Biosphere.

Sounds like Michael Crichton. No, scaring people is a quick path to professional suicide and even public ridicule, when your dire predictions fail to occur. The bias of scientists and engineers is to exaggerate the positive - synthesizing carbon nanotubes from atmospheric CO2, bio-engineering an improve photosynthesis, mining asteroids. File those away with the thousands of 'cures of cancer' that have been reported for decades.

Note to other essayists: to avoid composing so much twaddle, it is best not to set some arbitrary number for reasons for optimism. Are there really *Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover* or *Fifty Shades of Grey*?

Once, when expounding my grim views of the human prospect on another Reddit site, I encountered a very thoughtful young person, who having just discovered the enormity of the approaching catastrophe, spoke of the futility of his life. Taken aback, I felt obligated to console (Me!) this person - you bear no personal responsibility for this, so back away from the subject, go on with your life, seek out the things that give you comfort, and try to make what meaningful contribution you can.
