"cw3fwf9","t3_3p5pcb","3p5pcb","collapse","skeptical","> We've been making the assumption that the wealthy and powerful have been acting out of stupidity and greed, but what if they've actually been facing up to the reality of the situation? What if the survival of a fraction of the 1% is the best that we could ever have hoped for, and the history of the past sixty years is them desperately trying to kick the can down the road far enough that some of us would have the technology to be able to survive the impending armageddon?

The ""impending armageddon"", as you put it, was never inevitable. You are talking about the people who in large part control society and determine how much of our resources are used. If they were serious about making an effort to mitigate the effects of climate change, they would have issued very loud warnings about this as soon as they became aware of the danger, then they would've suggested we begin pouring enormous resources into developing the technologies that would allow our society to adapt, and furthermore they would've lobbied for that as well. But they didn't do that, as evidenced by the amount of time and resources that were and still are being wasted.

I sincerely mean no offense, but your theory is a fantasy. The relevant parties who knew of the danger but did nothing, I suspect the real reasons for their actions are some combination of the following:

* They didn't give a fuck. They'll live rich and powerful, they'll die rich and powerful, and after that it doesn't matter to them because they're dead.

* Maybe they thought jesus was gonna come and save everybody anyway. Lots of people believe this shit, so that wouldn't be too surprising.

* They don't value human life, except for their own, and their descendants, who they think will come out ok. 

* Denial. They deny that there is anything they can do to make a difference, even though they are already doing things that have been making a big difference for the worse. This one is similar to your rather charitable notions, but it is not the same because the truth, really, is that had substantial action been taken sooner (not even necessarily way way way sooner, but even just, say 25 years ago) the future could look a whole lot better than it does now.

"cw3fptk","t3_3p5pcb","3p5pcb","collapse","skeptical","I've played with explanatory models like this, but I can't get them to perfectly fit. Gambling with the climate, oceans, pollution, and mass extinctions because of unmitigated population growth seems too dumb to fathom. I understand the urge to make these models. Our collective behavior is insane. Why? That's what we're driven to figure out.

Having a small population could be an advantage. They could be highly educated and have a lot of leisure, and they wouldn't use up a lot of resources. Our education systems are deliberately terrible, so what's the point of having so many people? Technology could have grown much faster in the context of a smaller intelligent society versus a massive consumerist one. This technology advancement could only have helped the oligarchs even more - allowing more options for survival and mitigation/prevention of crises.

I haven't figured out why things got to this point though I'm still working on it. I know that evolution has played a large part in the stratification of our species through psychology more than ""intelligence"". I can't determine if oligarchical psychology is producing any rational long-term planning. They could have easily stopped things from getting to this state - they control the information channels and can easily shape the public. They didn't, and now we face what's likely going to be the darkest point in human history. Perhaps this is even the beginning of the end.

It would have taken large-scale collective efforts to deal with major existential threats to our species. You can't have a world of chaos where billions are dying, burning insane amounts of resources in desperation, and be able to deal with asteroids, new diseases, and any number of other unlikely but inevitable things.
