I (26M) grew up in California and have been on the East Coast (DC and now NYC) for about 10 years.  I've been plodding along in my career in B2B tech and currently have a well paying corporate job in NYC.  I majored in a liberal arts-y meets international relations degree with a focus on environment/energy type stuff but ultimately ended up pursuing a more startup/tech scene career.

I've always been very aware of climate change, etc. and the challenges it poses as well as thinking sometimes about how I'd like to refocus my career on this at some point when it makes sense.  However, after reading parts of the UN Climate Report and related coverage (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html), I'm seriously considering quitting my job and moving back to the SF Bay Area in California (to be closer to family and also b/c it seems there is a lot happening there in terms of what I'm interested in) to pursue a career doing SOMETHING to help steer the Earth towards a less sucky future.  I know the cost of living there is quite high.

I'm convinced that we cannot wait for fickle politicians to address this - it must be business solutions to climate change while the general gradually public shifts its tastes/focus by taking these threats seriously (ex: renewable energy becoming more competitive w fossil fuels, meatless 'meat' alternatives, some new refrigerant technology, etc.).  Of course voting in politicians who give a crap about climate change is also important and I intend to do this as well and do whatever I can in terms of public/private partnership type stuff.

I've read the Drawdown book that is frequently cited in this sub.  I have a good amount of money saved up to do a job search for at least a year if necessary but will likely be living with family initially so costs will be low.

Is this crazy?  I feel an urgency to DO SOMETHING that I haven't felt before and feel that I can no longer in good conscience continue in my current career/job (data consulting stuff for fortune 500 companies).

Any guidance is appreciated: ideas about jobs, organizations in SF Bay Area or in wider world, ways to get involved that pay decently, career arcs, feeling like you are truly an agent in this wider effort, etc.  What I want to find is an organization that really does something - not just lip service, not just talk.  Results.  Products.  World-changing feats.  Not BS corporate ""we are going green"" marketing that is meaningless.  I'm aiming high.  I don't want to just feel like I'm ""making a difference"".  I want to know that I truly am, even if it's on a small scale as an individual can only do so much.  Tesla is an obvious, probably cliché example of this (though some would argue there is a lot of talk there!).

I recognize that this is something an optimist would do.  I believe one has to be optimistic in this situation though there is plenty of reason to be pessimistic too given humanity's track record on this issue so far.

"9l10kp","science","scientific","2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Discussion Thread","The Nobel Prize committee jointly awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frances H. Arnold for **the directed evolution of enzymes** and George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter for **the phage display of peptides and antibodies**.

The official press release can be viewed [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2018/press-release/). The scientific explanation of the award from the Nobel committee can be viewed [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/advanced-chemistryprize-2018.pdf). The popular science background on the award can be viewed [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/popular-chemistryprize2018.pdf).

>The power of evolution is revealed through the diversity of life. The 2018 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry have taken control of evolution and used it for purposes that bring the greatest benefit to humankind. Enzymes produced through directed evolution are used to manufacture everything from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. Antibodies evolved using a method called phage display can combat autoimmune diseases and in some cases cure metastatic cancer.  
>  
>Since the first seeds of life arose around 3.7 billion years ago, almost every crevice on Earth has filled with different organisms. Life has spread to hot springs, deep oceans and dry deserts, all because evolution has solved a number of chemical problems. Life’s chemical tools – proteins – have been optimised, changed and renewed, creating incredible diversity.  
>  
>This year’s Nobel Laureates in Chemistry have been inspired by the power of evolution and used the same principles – genetic change and selection – to develop proteins that solve mankind’s chemical problems.  
>  
>One half of this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded to Frances H. Arnold. In 1993, she conducted the first directed evolution of enzymes, which are proteins that catalyse chemical reactions. Since then, she has refined the methods that are now routinely used to develop new catalysts. The uses of Frances Arnold’s enzymes include more environmentally friendly manufacturing of chemical substances, such as pharmaceuticals, and the production of renewable fuels for a greener transport sector.  
>  
>The other half of this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry is shared by George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter. In 1985, George Smith developed an elegant method known as phage display, where a bacteriophage – a virus that infects bacteria – can be used to evolve new proteins. Gregory Winter used phage display for the directed evolution of antibodies, with the aim of producing new pharmaceuticals. The first one based on this method, adalimumab, was approved in 2002 and is used for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Since then, phage display has produced anti-bodies that can neutralise toxins, counteract autoimmune diseases and cure metastatic cancer.  
>  
>We are in the early days of directed evolution's revolution which, in many different ways, is bringing and will bring the greatest benefit to humankind.","2018-10-03 13:10:58","79","54","0.79","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/9l10kp/2018_nobel_prize_in_chemistry_discussion_thread/","True","shiruken","1747901827.623723","renewables now","manual"
"9mnwte","collapse","skeptical","Five steps to 1.5 C = Bullshit","1) Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030

- This will never happen, period.

2) Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050

- 85% global electricity = 18% of total world power demand. You can't say emissions must be 0% at the same time only 18% of world fossil demand is renewable. 50% of Europe's renewable electricity comes from burning trees, and they want to double the amount of trees they burn by 2030.

3) Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero

- China is now building more new coal plants than there are in all the U.S.. China is reducing solar panel output 40% over 2 years. This is totally ignored.

4) Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia)

- By 2030 we'll need 50% more food and 30% more water. When they speak of reforesting, they're talking tree farms not biodiversity. 

5) Global net zero emissions by 2050

- 2050 = political, 2040 = reality

**What does it mean?**

A 45% reduction in energy = job losses. Decoupling growth from emissions is bullshit. The IPCC states that 2 C will only have a moderate impact on tourism, a statement so idiotic it defies explanation.

These IPCC reports are extorted and distorted half-truths based on political expediency. They already deleted a statement that 1.5 C = war and mass migration. 

There is no cohesive thought on this subject, let alone a coherent plan that makes any sense, whatsoever.

"9m4r4s","collapse","skeptical","Runaway Hothouse Earth Locked In By 2035","Some say 1.5 C is already locked in. I believe them. Some say it will be locked in by 2021. 3 years makes no difference.

Some say 2 C will be locked in by 2035. 18 years from now.

Some say 2 C will be reached as early as 2040.

What matters is that runaway hothouse can be triggered between now and 2040. But, why be so pessimistic?

Because the world's biggest carbon banks are reaching a saturation point, which in effect turns them into carbon bombs.

Permafrost wetlands will double carbon emissions. This alone can throw all our precious calculations into the trash heap. All those projection models do not account for this.

Super exponential Greenland ice melt will destroy thousands of years of climate stability. All those climate models do not account for this.

Neither do those models account for the profound effects of fracking, wars, famines, droughts, floods, tree and fish pirates, etc.. Yet these will undoubtedly accelerate dysfunction.

Some say in the next 10 years we will need 50% more food and 30% more water, at exactly the same time that extreme weather will decimate food production.

The new IPCC special report has already been watered down. The final draft deleted a statement saying that 1.5 C will cause mass migration and war.

Expect to hear a lot of fraudulent blather about the miracles of geo-engineering and renewable power. What this means is that all the dismal references to 2100 are obsolete. 2050 is the new 2100.

I'd like to go on, but I gotta get ready for a big turkey dinner tomorrow for all my wife's outlaws. Please god, kill me now.

"9kgefn","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2018 q3","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for almost 3 years now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

Feel free to share any of the material or repost this on other suitable subreddits. If you would like to get involved in this project, don’t hesitate to chat me up.
