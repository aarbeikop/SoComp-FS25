"d7ytdj","climate","scientific","What is the evidence for reservoir hydroelectricity contributing to greenhouse gas emissions?","Can someone show me any evidence that could  prove  reservoir  hydroelectric dams contribute to climate change? I have heard some people say it does, but not seen anything concrete

I'm Canadian, and here it has a ton of benefits, and very few drawbacks. Hydroelectric power is a great option for electricity in Canada because:

* The province of [Quebec produces 95% of its electricity from hydroelectricity.](http://neb.gc.ca/nrg/ntgrtd/mrkt/nrgsstmprfls/qc-eng.html#s1)  It basically has the cheat code for fixing climate change, due to geography and climate. It also has the lowest electrical prices in North America, and exports a huge amount of power to New York City. It provides a blueprint of what every jurisdiction should aim for, at least if they can. Why would we not do this if we can?
* [My government counts it as a renewable.](https://neb.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/lctrct/index-eng.html) The National Energy Board (NEB) are generally known for being impartial,  so I have no reason not to trust their science. Has any government agency anywhere actually confirmed some kind of evidence for dams making climate change worse?
* The NEB conducted a study, and [solar panels are not economical](http://neb.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/lctrct/rprt/cnmcsfslrpwr/index-eng.html) where 90% of Canadians live.
* We have another [6.5 Gigawatts worth of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity_in_Canada#New_projects) from reservoir based dams  under construction right now.
* In the past, indigenous groups would often have their land appropriated and get a simple financial settlement. but now relations have evolved from often bitter political disputes 50 years ago to  [becoming economic partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bay_Cree_hydroelectric_conflict). Today indigenous companies or employees maintain remote hydroelectric facilities and power lines,  and indigenous airlines transport goods. For many poor communities up north, this kind up investment can help elevate their standard of living tenfold and provide massive new infrastructure, investments, and employment.
* Destruction of Bio-diversity is less of a problem. Most of the area which ends up flooded is in the far north. While it is unfortunate the land is destroyed, quite frankly, there is a lot more of the same  frozen tundra up there. Enough that destroying the flooded area is worth it to obtain the vast  amount of renewable, reliable, cheap, green energy the dam will give us. The caribou aren't going to complain; they will move to the river next door.
* There is no lack of water. we have 7% of the worlds freshwater, and another 20% is locked in ice. If it gets warmer, its too much we will have a problem with, but not a lack of it.

So given the very few downsides, when I hear someone say something about a dam contributing to climate change, I am very skeptical. I am not going to change my beliefs away easily from the one near perfect solution we have, as long as climate and geography permit it.  I am coming with an open mind, but wanted people to know the context I am viewing it from, which impact the advantages and disadvantages here, rather  then one from the US or somewhere else in the world.

- lol, like that means anything.

I've been a progressive socialist since 1990, way back when the world promised to ""do"" something about climate change. I knew something was wrong when elites told us that paying carbon offsets for flights was a ""solution"" to climate change. That was 30 years ago, and emissions went up 60% since.

If you believed Obama would bring hope and change, you were disappointed, if you believed Trump would drain the swamp, you are disappointed. The only thing that got better was the number of bombs being dropped, which is up, up, up!

There have been 4 worldwide climate agreements since 1990, and each one them failed miserably. For the first 3 agreements, we overshot our promises by 100 mega tons /  year. In the last agreement, we've overshot promises by 200 mega tons / yr. At least we're improving on aspirational delusions. See chart link below:

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% during your lifetime. For you we have Naomi Klein and Greta Thunberg, who are leading Millennials into the emerald green utopia of a socialist techno-nirvana. 

Their call for disruption is no more than blackmail, which is fine for them because they won't get evicted for not paying the rent on time. They can afford disruption, you can't. If anything really bad happens, they can flee to well stocked family cottages and ride out the storm.

Edward Snowden recently did an interview with France 24 on YT. He says that Google and Facebook are up to no good. That was an understatement. Putting Google and FB in charge of fake news is like putting Satan in charge of Heaven. By combining the control of fake news with demonetisation, that control will be total and complete -- sure, it will get rid of a few bad weeds, but not without taking out all the wildlife, just like Monsanto. 

Some say Google deranked bad news about Monsanto, and I believe it. Why? Because I don't trust either of them. I believe the same to be true of 5G. I base these beliefs on years of cynicism, not any definitive proof. Definitive proof is in short supply these days, and even if you find it, it gets totally ignored.
