Not quite as expected but still all of the evidence points to warming.

Because of nonsensical responses from the deniers. Far to many people acted liked global warming meant that the entire globe had to warm rather than that there was a net warming.

>So, those of us who still aren't buying the AGW argument are now labeled climate change deniers.

Because you are. The evidence is massively showing warming.

>My disagreement with the AGW crowd

By ""AGW crowd"" do you mean climatologists?

>that humans, while contributors to GHG, are not the drivers or cause of global warming. As self-important as we'd like to consider ourselves, I do not believe we are in control of the earth's climate.

It is not an issue of importance, it is not an issue of control, it is an issue of pumping fossil carbon into the atmosphere. 

>I believe the climate changes and we don't have much say so in the matter. 

This is not an issue of belief, it is an issue of evidence. Somehow in your post you never talked about evidence.

It is not very much.  The Earth is huge but the biosphere as we understand it is a tiny film on its surface.  The Earth surface is about 510 million square Km.  The useable atmosphere is about 3 Km deep so 1.5 Billion cubic Km for 6 or 7 Billion people and all their industry and machines and cars and cows to spew into for all time.  This counts the open ocean.  So you figure that the activity of a handful of people over a few centuries couldn't change the temperature of 1 square Km of air?  Even if they cut down all the trees and bulldozed and paved the entire surface?  They could probably do that in a few decades of hard work and that in itself might generate some heat.  But you don't think people can do that?  I suppose if you picture three of the people lounging about living off the labour of the two that are willing to work but shit they could burn off that entire surface area in an afternoon!

**If the world believes you and does nothing about global warming and you're wrong:**

**CONS:** we could hit 5-6 degrees of warming by 2100. That's more warming and probably more ocean acidification than the worlds ecosystems can stand. Crops will fail, deserts will grow rapidly, Forrest's and the inhabitants will die off. The oceans will rise substantially and become full of mostly jellyfish and algae. Famine will affect everyone. Large regions currently habitable will become too hot for people to survive in summer.

**PROS:** Can't fucking think of any. Is jellyfish edible?

---------------------------------------

**Now imagine the world believes me and we move to renewables rapidly even though it wasn't needed.**

**CONS:** Maybe there is a small reduction in GDP growth for a transition period. Maybe not. Hundreds of thousands of people working in fossil fuels will need to be retrained.

**PROS:** We now have energy that isn't dependent on finite resources that will eventually run out. Shocks in the price of energy are a thing of the past. The air is cleaner. We don't have oil spills anymore. We don't have coal ash spills, we don't have fracking related earthquakes or water contamination. Perhaps the prices of renewables will go down enough with economies of scale that most of Africa will be able to afford to electrify finally.

Not even remotely true. Climate Change has been used a long time in the literature. The IPCC doesn't stand for the intergovernmental panel on Anthropogenic global warming. Also Global Warming and Climate Change are two different phenomenon Global Warming refers to the change in temperature and Climate Change refers to a whole series of changes including changes in temperature.","2015-07-28 13:10:19","1","dancemart","1747827495.863116","renewables now","manual"

It's pretty troublesome that he talks about efficiency gains being the reason for reduced energy consumption (for example in China or the US). Most of our tech is so efficient that there's very little energy efficiency gains to be had. Electrical motors controlled by frequency converters and modern coal furnaces with boilers and turbines are so close to their thermodynamic limits that it doesn't really leave any room for improvement. I think the real reason for reduced energy consumption is a) reduced economic activity and b) exporting production to cheaper countries than China.

I won't comment on the banning side but not to point out the obvious here but the science is telling us  we will destroy the biosphere as we know it, no amount of benefit from fossil fuels is worth that.

People come at this from the wrong end, how do we preserve ""western lifestyle"" and export that to the developing world and have effective mitigation, circling 'round and round that concept.  They've  missed the point entirely, you can't.  How you restructure society to preserve the biosphere is the only question.  We can either try and manage that process or we can react to it, we seem to have adopted the latter.  The former has to lead to better outcomes.  Civilisation needs redefining.

If you really want energy efficiency to save the world, the following needs to occur.

You need some sort of national carbon tax.  Something to account for extenalities.  What is currently proposed by Obama's Interagency working groups to be calculated into energy analysis is enough. It must be unequivocally in place.   



You need to blow a hole into the grid by removing 25-33% of it all at once.  The easiest and wisest pawn to sacrifice in this regard is nuclear.  You blow the hole by revoking the price anderson act protections for nuclear development, grandfathering existing nuclear in.  Existing nuclear will soon die, most plants are over 50 years old and need countless remedies and legal extensions to continue to operate, removing wide swaths of baseload from the grid.




What happens next is pretty neat from a biologists or economists perspective:  With the carbon tax in place, the real cost of shoving millions of tons of carbon into the air is accomodated, so per MW, natural gas has near price parity with land based wind.  Wind and to a smaller degree, solar, out competes NG and definitely coal, and we can be 93% renewable by 2030.
