"5yllhh","collapse","skeptical","Even the medieval era was unsustainable","Like modern people, medieval European people needed fuel. There were two kinds of fuel that were popular. The first kind of fuel was wood. The second kind of fuel, was peat. For most of human history, people chopped down trees to retrieve the fuel they needed. By the high middle ages however, there were places where people had hardly any forest left. In some of those places, people switched from burning trees, to burning peat. 

In Flanders, the lack of trees in the 12th century led the count of Flanders to insist that people should switch from using wood, to the use of peat instead. A few centuries later, the peat in Flanders was exhausted and Holland became the new regional economic powerhouse, as Holland still had plenty of access to peat. Vast swathes of the Dutch landscape are today located beneath sea level, as the peat was excavated and burned. Places that still have the original peat soil were declared nature reserves.

Eventually, people transitioned from the use of peat, to the use of coal. Surface deposits of coal were rapidly exhausted too in many places, which led to the construction of coal powered machines that could pump up water, thereby giving access to deeper coal deposits, which ultimately led to the industrial revolution. If you think a renewable future can be centered around biomass, I think you should have a conversation with the 12th century count of Flanders who found that biomass wasn't even sufficient for his own primitive economy.

It's not just energy that medieval people made use of. Like us, they made use of minerals. The minerals they used tended to have ores that were comparatively pure, free of undesirable adulterants. Most of these mines are now exhausted. It's certainly possible for future generations to recycle some of the resources we used ourselves, including something medieval people never had access to, aluminum. Eventually however, you will run out of many valuable minerals. I thus expect that 2500 AD will look more like 500 AD than like 1500 AD.","2017-03-10 11:36:35","156","106","0.89","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5yllhh/even_the_medieval_era_was_unsustainable/","True","iuseupyourusernames","1747870054.690517","renewables now","manual"
