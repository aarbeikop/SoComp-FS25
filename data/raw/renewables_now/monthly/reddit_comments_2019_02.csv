They are all part of the same process.

"efoiwce","t3_amtq1s","amtq1s","collapse","skeptical","My friend, I commend your effort to call out all souls, as I try myself with all my heart.

I realized recently that if there's anything I can do, it's communicate to and encourage every single person I can to just search and look for themselves.

If I can't do that (not all situations are appropriate), I just try to make them realize how most of everything that's happening in this world that's wrong starts with belief and the word can't.

I replace that with another one when I share my beliefs.

Belief that things can change

Belief that my children can live a bright future

Belief that this earth can be saved

Belief that human minds can heal

Belief that I can change now, if i so wish



I also believe that if others choose to replace the word can't by can and choose wisely what they believe in, things will be alright.

EDIT: Insight from another post...

I project a movie in my head with my idea as a story, my mind as a projector, emotions as music, and my mouth and body as a screen.

What I project to the world is of my own creation, not the contrary. Meaning that it's not the world that shapes itself, it's the collective of projections that does.

That's when I realize I can shape the world if I so wish, any way I want to.

But I can't do it alone...","2019-02-03 21:02:58","20","[deleted]","1747910026.016449","renewables now","manual"

The proper thing to have done would have been to fund big projects for alternative energy sources and removing carbon from the atmosphere, solar and even a much bigger program for fusion research started back in the 60’s etc. all these useless wars waged since Vietnam, plus the Trillions wasted building nuclear bombs and their delivery systems (ICBMs, B52 bombers, B1, stealth just to name a few plus huge military vessels, both surface and subs etc), huge military industrial complexes and standing armies on all sides etc, look how much was wasted on WW1 and WW2, that finished off multiple empires on both sides.....if we had saved all of the money, resources and minds wasted on wars these last 1500 years we could have a massive Star Trek (non military civilization) by now with such bonuses such as real replicator/recycling tech using nanotechnology and have defeated all medical problems using the same nanotechnology biotechnology to fix our cell cheaply...Jeff Besoes of Amazon wants to use tech to become a space fairing civilization and populate our solar system with this new tech, but we have to stop wasting money and resources on war and we have to upgrade our energy systems etc.

a large handful of their ""fans"" answered that not only is the hashtagsomeonesfuneralparty still on, that they have a right to mourn the guy because they're also utterly devestated, ""maybe even more than the boys"" was one reply. I'm giving them the fact that they're mostly hormonal teenage girls attracted to the kids and everything, but the tags on twitter were disgusting, and pictures of girls outfit sharing their pastel yellow strapless dress to the FATHERS FUNERAL was acceptable. and they legit don't understand why they were refused pictures after travelling cross country for this super must attend exclusive meet and greet.
