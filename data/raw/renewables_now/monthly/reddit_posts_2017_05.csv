"693zet","sustainability","action-oriented","Fossil Fuel Free Family Farm","I am going to call this F5. It's our family's goal to make the paradigm shift from fossil fuels to renewables on our family farms. We have taken the first step at our cabin on Porter Lake (Restoule, Ontario) making it a power free lake meaning that no fossil fuel eating motors are allowed. We have purchased a battery powered chainsaw and are also researching an electric quad bike. 

We have one of our sheds on our farm in the Byron Bay Hinterland off the grid and are now investigating how we can take our farm house off the grid too.

I would love to hear from other farmers and landowners who are looking to become or already are fossil fuel free.

Here is a link to a farm that's ""smelling what I am trying to step in""
