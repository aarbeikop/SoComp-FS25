This is FALSE. you should rephrase it: eating meat fed from Grain/soy monocultures ","2016-01-13 15:39:27","8","[deleted]","1747842064.918593","renewables now","manual"

"cyx9myz","t3_40rwqw","40rwqw","collapse","skeptical","There will definitely not be any collapse.  These are some Guy McPherson figures here: assuming the worst case scenario and then some for every factor, and then counting the feedback loops multiple times over. 

Basically, none of these studies account for intermediary changes in science and technology; they all assume business as usual for the next twenty years, which we'll have anything but.  Yes, we may have an economic collapse of sorts, and it may be very difficult, but we will also learn a great deal, be forced to fundamentally restructure the economy, and be back on our feet less than a decade later (i.e. the Great Depression).  

We are predicted to move away from oil, coal and gas extremely quickly, to the extent that it's shocking even Al Gore.  Electric cars, lab grown meat, self driving cars (which reduces automobile numbers significantly), AI efficiency, GMOs (that can grow in all kinds of environments, including vertical farms that are already being built), desalinization and much much more are going to push back our day or reckoning much faster than it will approach -- by any metric.  

I was a collapser once, but then began conducting real research rather than just looking for evidence that tried to spell out doom.  The future will be like the past and the present, filled with daunting hardships (remember when AIDS, crack, the hole in the ozone layer, or gangs, were all spelling out the end of the world), but we will continue to endure.

And 8 out of every 10 physicists believe solar alone can totally replace hydrocarbons.  Callaghan can't make up his mind.  Listen to the scientists who promised fusion, quantum computers, room temp superconductors, etc ?  

The Scientists are BANKRUPT.  

The best they can do is the 15000th book on quantum mechanics.","2016-01-14 03:46:51","1","StarvingLion","1747842064.93046","renewables now","manual"
