I have been intentionally working my way into groups of people that deny climate change as part of their identity. Something that these groups share is a lack of connection to the finality of oil consumption and that if you can make that connection; that non renewable resources mean there is a limited supply that will never return. This should be hilariously obvious, but it's unfunnily common.   


Are people *avoiding* thinking about scarcity over time or are they simply *not* thinking about it?   


Which methods have you used to successfully draw people's attention to how destructively we're existing? Did it lead to a permanent change in their behavior? What approaches have you tried that are universally unsuccessful?  


With a hobby of mine, I'm trying to develop a citizen-science initiative to find an ideal mushroom substrate. I think there's a lot of room with this crisis to support proper, honest collaboration. If profit is removed as a motive and the goal is common and shared equally, people will participate and provide data as long as someone isn't profiting from their work more than they're profiting from sharing it. The internet was created for this purpose and is more suited for easily sharing data now than ever.  Is there a site - a data aggregator, I suppose like Reddit but for data- where parameters are entered and data recorded, that anyone can access and add to but whose contributions would be rated, like Reddit? 

We're looking out to quantum computers for help with optimization but are ignoring the massive parallel computational and experimental power of thousands or millions of people sharing the same data. Lets take pot holes, as an example: allow the site to collect accelerometer and gps data while traveling faster than 10 mph, and a threshold of 'shake' is reached. On their own, these data points have too much error, but averaged over thousands of shots, you'll have a fairly good idea of where the bad potholes are. 

I understand that this is where we're pretending our economy is being moved to. I hope we're all smart enough here to realize the folly in building an economy on a foundation entirely dependent on the cooperation of a hostile foreign power. There's only value in technology when there's a more or less enslaved labor force doing the real manufacturing - can't eat data, after all.

I'm primarily looking for feedback on your experiences with the psychological 'walls' you've been hitting; the 'tap-out' points where you lose people and only make them more resolute in denying the obvious. I'm also curious in what you think are the best and most effective ways to work together on the first, and likely last, truly global problem.   


If we can't stop it, we must at least bear witness to it. We can't give into to hopelessness... or if we do, do it by removing yourself from the system, not by doubling down on our shamelessness and giving into 'everyone else is doing it so it must be ok'... i feel like we hold our toddlers to a higher standard of behavior than we hold each other, and hold ourselves to none.","2019-11-12 19:08:18","42","44","0.91","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dvemfa/why_no_one_cares/","True","CFUsOrFuckOff","1747928604.009452","renewables now","manual"
