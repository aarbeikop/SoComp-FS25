"cwqs2fg","t3_3rrhnl","3rrhnl","collapse","skeptical","Found this reading Cormac McCarthy the other night: “John thinks that the laws of the universe may themselves be evolving. He asks such questions as where were the laws of physics before the universe was created. Was there, is there a matrix, a mother field, existing outside time? All this is a bit thorny for me. I don’t know. I believe that the laws are the laws. I believe that the reason there are millions of planets is the same reason there are millions of eggs. To allow for failure. There must be countless experimental situations like this one. The only thing that is not expendable is the experiment itself. Our notions of our own uniqueness are precisely that. Our notions. We will not be missed. When we have slaughtered and poisoned everything in sight and finally incinerated the earth itself then that black and lifeless lump of slag will simply revolve in the void forever. There is a place for it too. A nameless cinder of no consequence even to God. That man can halt this disaster now seems so remote a possibility as to hardly bear consideration.” ","2015-11-06 16:33:52","37","[deleted]","1747837289.3617952","renewables now","manual"
"cwqux67","t3_3rrhnl","3rrhnl","collapse","skeptical","Nietzsche was wrong about the Abyss. Our problem as a species is that we're too cowardly to stare at the Abyss at all because it reveals the meaningless of the space we currently occupy and the lack of criteria for navigating this infinite space. It reveals a level of responsibility we can't tolerate. So instead we settle for running the machinery that evolution programmed us with, preferring to ride its self-destructive illusions rather than dismantle it and move ourselves  somewhere else within the Abyss.

Of course, there is no place to go other than spaces less suicidal and subjectively more interesting than our current existence space, but we will never go such places. Meaninglessness doesn't have to be painful for the fearless, but cowards stay where they're put and are beaten.","2015-11-06 17:42:31","16","EntropyAnimals","1747837289.3637161","renewables now","manual"
"cwqvkha","t3_3rrhnl","3rrhnl","collapse","skeptical",">The only 2 things in history that all of the world's cultures have had in common are two shared core beliefs. They are Life-After-Death and Money. Both of these things are NOT real, they are human inventions. We made them up for control and power over people. As long as we get money and power we will perpetuate the lies. 

You hit the nail on the head. Its unfortunate that people let their emotions override their ability to think rationally. As far as religion is concerned it blows my mind how anybody can think that we should give nonsense made up by bronze age savages (that's the most modern religion btw) any credence. 

Regarding money it should be very obvious that the pursuit of money should not put the environment and foundation of our existence at risk, but people easily delude themselves.","2015-11-06 17:57:53","12","xenobian","1747837289.3653572","renewables now","manual"

So getting your knickers in a twist because Homo Sap is going to go Extinct is a waste of time.  It's a guarantee.

IMO it's probably not going to get to ww3, but we are in for large waves of migration from tropical regions into industrialized nations. Which is going to freak them out and lead to the rise of fascism. The European ""refugee crisis"" is pretty much how it's going to go except on a far larger scale. 

When you get a bunch of scared fascists running the government bad for things are going to happen, obviously for the refugees, but really for everyone. I expect major atrocities committed against the refugees, loss of all kinds of rights for everyone, and probably proxy wars, but I don't think it is ever going to get to the point of the world powers actually shooting at each other simply because nuclear nations just don't do that (India and Pakistan being a special case.)","2015-11-05 13:39:07","6","whatabear","1747837470.506658","renewables now","manual"
