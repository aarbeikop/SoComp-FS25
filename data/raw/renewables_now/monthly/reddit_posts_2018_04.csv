No Soil & Water Before 100% Renewable Energy 
https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/no-soil-water-before-100-renwable-energy/

Humans emit 40 gtons of carbon each year.

Humans must emit 0 gtons of carbon in 20 years, every year to survive.

Humans must suck 10 gtons of carbon out of the air each year after to stop runaway emissions.

We do not have the land, water and energy resources to do that.

We cannot turn rainforests into tree plantations without killing life on earth.

The biogeochemical systems that give us the good life are killing earth faster than thought.

Fossil emissions are going down only 1% / decade as a part of total energy use.

To avoid 2° C, fossil emissions must go down 100% in 2 decades says Stefan Rahmstorf.

The news by fracking scientist, Dr. Ingraffea, means emissions now have to go down 100% in 10 years!

Kevin Anderson says we have a 5% chance of staying below 2° C.

This means we have 95% chance of not avoiding disaster in 10-20 years.

"8asbub","environment","emotional","It is time we were honest with ourselves. We need to end our increasingly desperate addiction to hopium.","The world’s tropical jungles/rainforests now emit more carbon than they absorb. Forests are half the size they were in 1978. And deforestation is accelerating, not decelerating. As climate heats up, even soils in temperate regions will also be unable to hold onto as much carbon as the currently do, and even more forests will be unable to take in more carbon then they release. How will we get carbon sequestration and oxygen production, then?

Marine phytoplankton, responsible for half of all the oxygen we breathe, are now down 40% in population compared to the 1950s. Oceanic warming, chemical contamination, and acidification are taking their toll. There is a real prospect that they will die off in just the next few decades due to these factors. Again, where does that leave us for carbon sequestration and oxygen production?

The frozen methane locked in shallow Arctic sea beds and in Arctic permafrost soils have already begun to outgas a decade ago: constant streams of bubbles fizz to the surface from thousands of seeps, and on land sometimes in spectacular explosions that leave massive craters that look like the aftermath of an artillery bombardment across Siberia. That pace is accelerating faster than scientists thought. We know methane is some 100 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon, but there is also twice the amount of carbon locked in these Arctic regions than currently exists in the atmosphere, ready to let go.

The runaway train ain’t stopping. We know we will have a Blue Water event by 2020 to 2025, meaning no more free-floating Arctic sea ice. Guess what that means for the albedo effect? These damned feedback loops will reinforce each other in a vicious cycle.

Yet the vast majority of the IPCC (UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)'s projections/scenarios INCLUDE the miraculous effect of un-invented, un-tested, un-scaled negative emissions technology. In other words, they are actually far too optimistic about humanity's ability to develop, test, and scale technological breakthroughs to save the planet.

No country has met targets for this past year under the Paris Agreement, which still allows countries like China and India to INCREASE carbon emissions until the 2030s before leveling off. Emissions increased worldwide in 2017.

So-called “renewable resources” like hydro, geothermal, nuclear. solar, wind, and tide... still account for less than 2% of all energy use worldwide (including transportation). Of new power generation capacity placed on-line worldwide in 2017, 75% of these power plants burned fossil fuels (coal is cheap).

Stop thinking there will be a transition. The amount of concrete and steel alone necessary to build renewable energy plants to replace all current fossil fuel plants (not including transportation): 1. is more than the world can mine and produce in decades, 2. is a massive carbon intensive process, 3. would take decades, even if all other building and construction worldwide were halted. Remember, the vast majority of new power plants under construction or in planning stages across the globe are going to be coal-fired.

For decades, every environmental article or film in mainstream media has put in a few words of hopeful messaging. But like WW2 German reports of victories, the battles being “won” seem to keep getting closer and closer to Berlin. The hopium at the end of every article or film today strains credibility. It is time we were honest with ourselves.","2018-04-08 19:30:08","105","133","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/8asbub/it_is_time_we_were_honest_with_ourselves_we_need/","True","hillsfar","1747888572.685598","renewables now","manual"
"8ahmfc","sustainability","action-oriented","The BIGGEST Lie greedy Businesses Like to Tell","The TRUTH is - We are discovering new resources FAR QUICKER than we are consuming old ones and we have more than enough here on planet earth for every single person to live in abundance. 

Most people believe the opposite to be true because greedy businesses rely on traditional resources, like oil, coal and steel, which are indeed running out (non-renewable). We still rely on non-renewable resources because until just recently that has been cheaper. But we are discovering renewable resources rapidly because our awareness about the damage we are causing with traditional methods is now undeniable.    

The fact is that since the scientific revolution (and the invention of money and credit) whenever we have wanted ANYTHING, we’ve put ourselves to the test to create it. Here are some epic examples. 

-	To solve world agriculture problems we literally learnt to make ammonia (to enrich soil) out of THIN AIR!
-	We turned tungsten (a then useless metal) into light bulbs and changed the world forever!
-	To free ourselves from needing slaves and relying on our muscles, we invented engines and motors.
-	So we could stay connected, we turned copper into phone lines.

BUT WHAT ABOUT TODAY? Surely we are out of ‘inventions’? What do we want now?

-	Leading scientists (like Neil Degrasse Tyson) speculate that we know less than 5% of any given field (loads of room for new discoveries). 
-	Elon Musk is commercialising renewable clean energy with Tesla and Solar City (seriously google it, he is insane). 
-	Globally, through ITER, we are replicating the technology of the sun – to make INFINITE energy using hydrogen for fuel with helium as the emission!
-	We can turn soybeans into grapheme and use that to build bridges or filter seawater to make clean water.
-	AI…
-	Immortality…

So why do we still rely on old resources? Well, it is frankly still cheaper and GOD we are so resistant to change, at every level, from the individual to the multinational corporation. But we can make a BIG difference and some people are…

One of the big reasons that we personally haven’t been able to influence change is we keep CONSUMING the things we don’t actually like and we are NOT INVESTING in the solutions we’d rather have. The crazy part is – you KNOW what solution you want (anything that helps make things better for EVERYONE) and those people who invest in the solutions are getting wealthy! Here’s how real change makers help us shift to renewable resources.

AWARENESS – Notice anytime you buy something and then resent the purchase. Doesn’t matter what it is – from one-time use plastics to a gym membership to car insurance. Whatever it is, the fact that you resent it means that you would love a better product. 

ACCEPTANCE – Whatever it is that annoys you personally, at some time not too long ago, we really wanted that product. For all of history we dreamed of something as beautifully practical as plastic so we created it. What we have today is the dreams of yesterday but what you want is a dream of the future.

ALIGNMENT – We can’t (and shouldn’t aspire to) go back in time. We can only go forward and to do that we have to be ATTRACTED to a BETTER solution. If you had INFINITE resources, how would you create a better solution? Now, someone out there is already working on this solution and will create it – PROFITABLY. The job of a change maker is to support them. Not to fight against the ‘bad guys’ but to support the good guys! 

ACTION – Support the best by INVESTING in them. Easy. By investing in them, you whelp them succeed but when they succeed, you personally profit. YouTube Egoistic Altruism for an enlightening video about how your personal success helps others succeed too. 

Creating new resources today is literally like creating ammonia out of thin air! We are entering the GOD MODE of science and we can do anything we put our mind to if we cooperate…

But how do we cooperate? We need to learn to trust each other! Now how do we do that? Well, so far, today the most universal, most efficient system of trust that we have ever created is MONEY! One day we will have something even better, but even Bitcoin is just money (a more trustable money). 

I’ll be sharing more about how money is going to play THE KEY ROLE in helping create sustainability soon. Basically, ANY endeavour that we make to create a sustainable future MUST be profitable. So before ever supporting ANY good cause again, or investing in an organisation that is going to create a revolutionary breakthrough with a new invention – do yourself (and the world) a favour by learning how to invest money so that you GUARANTEE that you never loose. It’s not impossible, it’s just knowledge. Rich people are doing it today, so you can do it too!
