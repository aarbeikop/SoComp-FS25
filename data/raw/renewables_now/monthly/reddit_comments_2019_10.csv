Though this study may not hold up, if that were true, could genetic screening for negative traits and subsequent gene therapy become possible, if not widespread in the future?

Will insurance companies ever be able to request a release of a person's genome, or of specific loci (again if this study is true), when offering auto insurance, life insurance, etc...?  I'm interested in your input because I hadn't even considered such possibilities until recently. 

 Personally, I think genetic information needs to be kept extremely private.

(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/01/26/531269.full.pdf.) 

On a different note diversity of research is important, especially when addressing research inequality. The company 54gene is certainly helping to address this issue, but huge gaps remain in other populations, especially populations that are nomadic or with a justified fear of goverment/science.

One last question. What are your thoughts on nebula genomics business model? I am skeptical that it increases donor interaction with their data, I am concerned that participants in their program can see have their data used in a predatory manner. Although it is an 'anonymous' program genotype-phenotype relationships are important, companies may want more interaction with the owner of the DNA.

How will we handle genetic information that could be perceived to predetermine the fates (medical, psychological, or otherwise) of these populations? How will we prevent further oppression based on genetic information? How will we empower folks who perceive trauma to negatively affect their genomic offspring (if that is indeed affirmed by science, which is yet to be seen though a growing number of people still believe it regardless)?

I’m not looking for a discussion on the validity of trauma-influenced epigenetic changes or even the severity of how the ACEs affect everyday life.

There is also the issue of gatekept technology. With accessible food and medicine increasingly being seen as a human right, it's unethical to create crops that require proprietary insecticides to survive. We should be engineering food to be be more flavorful or nutritious. Instead food is engineered to machine money from farmers and the public at the expense of flavor, nutrition, and frankly the ecosystem as a whole.

That's all tangential to the question you're asking, but it's an important illustration of what we need to prevent in the medical field. Industry wants profit. Health wants wellbeing. Those are fundamentally contrary goals. We could end up in a world where gene therapies are engineered to addict us to proprietary medicines for the rest of our lives when they could be made to work the first time.

If a user password is compromised its something that be be disposed of and replaced, but that concept isnt possible with biometric data.  Due to this fact, biometric login data is typically encrypted at the device level so that the platform you authenticate against does not hold and can not get the bio-data.  The fact that companies like those that provide fast airport check-in aggregate biometric data is terrifying to me.

Using this idea that the genetic data is unable to be changed by the owner and has potentially catastrophic consequences if accessed by certain sources, you simply should not hold personally identifiable genetic data in a way you can access it.

I can just imagine someones genetic information that resulted in a multi billion dollar spin off industry getting skimmed and made anonymous 'accidentally' or the person in question gets occasionally invited to cut a ribbon somewhere and then has to go back to their slum and put a trophy of appreciation that cost six months of their rent next to a high-school bowling trophy or something.

 I want to be optimistic about this and I am excited for the future of genetic engineering and gene therapy but I feel like this will end up being a ""the meek shall inherit the earth but not its mineral rights"" kind of situation where massive multinational corporations just steam roll anyone trying to get any sort of compensation from their genetic data with lawyer team with a million dollar retainer. 

I think this is a terrible time to be an individual with unique genetic information that could be beneficial to society because the implications and practices of genetics is so far ahead of not only the general public, but the vast majority of lawmakers, that having a meaningful conversation about it is nearly impossible. Not to mention many companies who are involved in genetic research are not locked to one country and there are always hungrier economies with more lax regulations. 

In 25, 50, ? Years I think the fruits of this labor are going to be fantastic but I feel like a lot of people are going to get screwed hard in the process. It would be interesting to have a process where the intellectual property rights of an individual's genetic information are shared between the original source(person) and the discoverer for a set period of time. Although I suppose whats to stop you from just editing the gene sequence enough to make a similar but legally distinct analogue.

Tl;dr: I'm optimistic about the potential benefits of real world applications of genetic data but I have zero faith that the information will be handled ethically","2019-10-03 15:45:38","2","begaterpillar","1747926623.14956","renewables now","manual"

Obviously there are many issues as well like whether pharmaceutical companies could potentially gain access to or ""own"" parts of your genome with these therapies. I imagine in the future genetic data would be rolled into our existing HIPPA laws if they aren't already. Do you believe that these laws would be sufficient, or are there additional considerations that our current laws miss?","2019-10-03 15:54:04","2","soulsquisher","1747926623.1505542","renewables now","manual"

Even if it's anonymous, it's still a massive violation of personal privacy. Would you want people to use your banking activatity for research or your child's daily schedule? Not only is it a violation of said individual it's also a violation against everyone closely related to then. It's disgusting what 23 and me and the other myriad of other companies are doing. If I had it my way I'd completely ban any public offering of DNA sequences from humans.","2019-10-03 17:30:38","2","Lou-Saydus","1747926623.1525261","renewables now","manual"
