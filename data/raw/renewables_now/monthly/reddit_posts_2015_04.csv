How a farmer described growing wheat over the last 20 years...

Before:

► Plant seed harvested from previous year

► Allow wheat to grow naturally

► Harvest cutting ~1 foot from ground (storing some seed for next year's use, selling the extra)

► Plow (turning chaff, stubble, and weeds into ground for nutrient breakdown)

► Remove from planting rotation for 1 year

► Plow (cutting off roots)

► Plow (turn plant material into soil)

► Repeat

Now:

► Plant seeds bought from GMO manufacturer

► Drench with GMO's herbicide to prevent anything else from growing

► Spray with chemical fertilizers (because the ground doesn't have enough nutrients)

► Spray with herbicide to kill the whole field at once to ensure the whole field is ready to cut at the same time.

► Harvest, cutting the wheat all the way to the ground because it doesn't grow tall enough due to lack of nutrients

► Sell all seeds that came off of plants (it's illegal to keep anything)

► Burn off minimal stubble and turn once into the ground with disc.

► Repeat until soil is gone.

► GMO INTENSIVE LIVESTOCK FARMING WILL DESTROY LIFE ON EARTH AND IS A 

... SUPER-NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO EVERY HUMAN BEING

► Runaway mass extinction is unstoppable and irreversible once started.

► Green Energy is our solution to Climate Change.

► But, Climate Change is only 1 of 6 Direct Drivers for Mass Extinction.

► 50% of land vertebrate species died off in the last 50 years.

► 50% of land vertebrate species will die off in the next 40 years.

► +50% = Unstoppable Irreversible Mass Extinction.

► 75% Species Loss = Mass Extinction.

► The 6 Direct Drivers of Mass Extinction are:

… 1) Invasive Species

… 2) Over-Population

… 3) Over-Exploitation

… 4) Habitat Loss

….5) Climate Change

….6) Pollution

► GREEN ENERGY WILL NOT STOP MASS EXTINCTION

► Humans and livestock are earth's number one invasive species.

► We are in the last doubling of resource demand.

► At current growth rates our energy demand will exceed the output of the sun in 1,500 years.

► Energy demand is set to double in 50 years.

► Emissions have to go down 80% in 30 years.

► Renewable energy uses more minerals for less energy than fossil fuels.

► Post-peak minerals will hit in 20 years – more energy needed for less minerals extracted.

► It takes 10X more intermittent electrical energy to displace one unit of fossil electrical energy.

► It takes one ton of coal to make just 6 solar panels.

► Solar and wind turbine production is deadly toxic.

► Green energy systems only last 30 years and have to be replaced.

► We can’t replace billions of green systems every 30 years and save earth.

► Recycling their alloys is difficult and uses more energy than mining.

► Green energy doesn’t run on the sun and wind, it runs on mining minerals.

► Green energy is driven by short-term greedy capitalism and corruption.

► Green energy products will have to be replaced in 30 years during extreme shortages.

► Especially under current emissions-depletions-extinction scenarios.

► 40% Green Energy requires 200% more copper says John Timmer of Ars Technica.

► There is no real substitute for copper says Mat McDermott of Motherboard.

... http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/blog/there-are-no-substitutes-for-the-metals-in-your-smartphone

► We mined 50% of all the copper in human history in just the last 30 years.

► 100% green energy requires 500% more copper.

► Peak minerals includes more than just copper.

► By 2050, expect to be past peaks for tin, silver, nickel, zinc, cadmium and more.

... http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/extracted:paperback

► Most new hi-tech green energy exotic mineral requirements are energy-cost prohibitive.

► We move some 3 billion tons of earth per year to get 15 millions tons of copper.

► We can’t afford to mine 500% more copper at ever lower concentrations.

► We cannot recycle it into existence.

► We cannot conserve it into existence.

► Substituting aluminum for copper wire takes 5X the energy and is a brittle fire hazard.

► Google’s own Stanford Phd, green energy experts, Ross Koningstein and David Fork, tell IEEE Spectrum why

► In just 13 years, we will “lock in” an inevitable near term 6°C earth temp rise because we continually exceed the worse-case emissions scenario set out back in 2007 says climate scientist, Dr. Michael Jennings.

► Why Trolls Are Green

You will notice I barely mentioned climate change. That's because green energy boosters focus exclusively on climate change and ignore everything else. They know we don't have enough resources to provide renewable energy for 9 billion people every 30 years. Green energy is based on mining, not the sun, the wind and the stars. The number one concern of miners is, supply and the profit-loss break even point. Solar panels and wind turbines are sold by giant conglomerates who just want to sell us as many panels and turbines as they can before we run out. Divestment is just a distraction for rich old and young. Learn why Bill McKibben and Naomi Klein and the NIC (Non-profit Industrial Complex) are funded by Wall Street.
