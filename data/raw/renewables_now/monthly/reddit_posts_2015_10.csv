I study how waste and discarded materials are managed and recently found that Americans dispose of nearly 300 million tons of waste annually - AMA!","EDIT:  I'm now live - bring on your burning garbage questions, Reddit!  Thanks for so many great questions so far, I'll be hanging out Friday afternoon and checking up on new ones that arrive.


Hi reddit,

I, along with my co-authors, recently published a [manuscript in Nature Climate Change](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2804.html) that had a few key findings.  

First, we found that every American is disposing of about 5 pounds of waste per person per day, but that US landfills generally have several decades of life remaining.  Second, we examined engineered systems built at landfills to collect gases produced when waste decomposes and identified the factors that most greatly impact the performance of these systems. Taken together, we identified areas where significant reductions in greenhouse gases can be achieved and uncovered opportunities for additional renewable energy production. 

I have worked on materials and waste management issues across multiple continents and am passionate about expanding the use of data to better understand how we manage materials in the US, with the goal of identifying hotspots where more sustainable decisions can be made.  

TL;DR America disposes of a lot of waste and we can reduce current/future gas emissions and produce more energy with improved gas collection practices.

"3p5pcb","collapse","skeptical","The wealthy and powerful have known about the upcoming collapse for decades","Now that we have evidence that [large corporations have been aware of global warming for decades](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/16102015/two-us-representatives-seek-justice-department-inquiry-exxon), and have been intentionally disseminating disinformation to deter the public's awareness of the issue, we have to ask ourselves one question.

What the fuck?

Because seriously, this makes no sense. If you find out you're selling poison, and the poison is going to kill everyone including you, you stop selling it. There are no profits that are worth death. And even death deferred a few generations isn't worth short-term profits. You'd have to be a colossal idiot to continue along a business as usual course under those circumstances, and the wealthy and powerful aren't universally stupid. Plus, it's a narrative that conveniently excuses them from all responsibility. I think there's something else going on.

There's only one explanation I can come up with. By the time we knew about all of this, it was already too late.

We had [Gilbert Plass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Plass) warning us about CO2 back in the 50s, there were [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Plundered_Planet) about the [population crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vogt) on the bestseller list in the 40s. We knew there was an [imminent famine](https://deeplythinking.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/1966-famine-in-india/) building up in India, and [fifteen million people starved to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine) in China between 1958 and 1961. We're supposed to believe that the wealthy and powerful all just decided to bury their heads in the sand for the whole [history of climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science) and [population pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population) and ignore what was obviously on around them, even though they make their fortunes by investing while trying to anticipate the future. The current narrative, that all of them were equally stupid and blindly ignorant is satisfying at a visceral level, but it's frankly impossible.

I think a lot of them the wealthy and powerful are pretty smart, and they're usually rational people with understandable motivations. Most of them don't ignore science habitually. I think some of them looked into the upcoming crises. I think they found out that billions of people were going to die, and there was nothing they could do about it.

From here in the 2010s, with the fog of obfuscation clearing, it's become pretty obvious to us too. The idea that we can support this huge population boom that's the direct result of the oil we learned how to refine [back in 1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_petroleum_industry#Modern_history) after the oil runs out is ludicrous. We'd need some alternative energy source that's incredibly cheap. Combine that with the environmental impact of the population, and it's pretty obvious that shit is going to go horribly wrong at some point in the future. Any solutions that can be put in place require world peace, and a central government that can pass down strict controls on population and energy use, and they knew exactly what would happen if anyone tried that kind of power grab.

When businesspeople see huge problems, they see huge opportunities. I think they contracted studies, and hired researchers, and the numbers came back hopeless. A hockey stick curve, then a crash. They calculated the world's exponential population growth, which was perfectly predictable, and the output of CO2, also perfectly predictable, and they came to the same conclusions we have, sixty years ago.

At some point in the future, billions of people are going to die, and there's nothing we can do about it.

It reframes the question. If the death of the vast majority of the human population is inevitable, then you have to start looking at the survival of the species.

I think they tried. Looking back at the history of the 20th century from this perspective, it makes a certain amount of sense. The population of industrialized nations were [whipped into a frenzy of consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self) to drive them to new heights of productivity, and therefore progress, with new scientific advancements coming out at ever-inceasing rates. The space program was rushed into being because there was a whole universe of resources out there that might save our hides, but that turned out to be a wash. They thought [nuclear energy was going to solve everything](https://gailtheactuary.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/hubbert-_nuclear_fossil-fuel-to-50001.png?), but that turned out to be more problematic than they'd imagined. [China's one-child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy) was an attempt to see if population controls could make a diffence, and the answer was kind of, and at a huge price, and in an authoritarian state. Meanwhile, all they had to do to keep people from seeing the approaching apocalypse was to cast a pall of dubiousness on environmental science by associating them with the hippie movement and trotting out a few lunatics with doctorates whenever people started getting worried.

Think about the solutions that are currently being proposed; renewable energy, indoor farming, electric cars, automation. They don't scale. An economy based on these technologies won't support billions. With advanced enough technology, our species can survive even if our planet becomes uninhabitable. We can't all survive, of course, but the more technology we have, the better the chances that some of us will make it. 

We've been making the assumption that the wealthy and powerful have been acting out of stupidity and greed, but what if they've actually been facing up to the reality of the situation? What if the survival of a fraction of the 1% is the best that we could ever have hoped for, and the history of the past sixty years is them desperately trying to kick the can down the road far enough that some of us would have the technology to be able to survive the impending armageddon?

I'm not proposing some overarching conspiracy to keep this from the public. I think anyone can look at this situation from a strategic perspective and come to this conclusion fairly quickly. The difference is that the people in power knew they didn't have any tricks up their sleeve to save everybody. We kept waiting for them to wake up and do something, but they were already awake and working away. Every bit of progress we've made in the last half-century has been another step towards our race's self-sufficiency and survival.

At the cost of billions of lives.

But when the population is the problem, what's the solution? If you implement population control and the countries around you don't, you're at a tremendous strategic disadvantage a generation down the road. Is it better for billions of people to die, or for them never to have existed? But the bottom line is, if you start putting downward pressure on the population, you impact your nation's productivity. And the race is depending on that productivity to fuel the science we need to survive.

The wealthy and powerful are going to build settlements in isolated places, hardened against the environment, using the technologies we've developed in manufacturing, materials science, energy, automation, and defense, and they're going to create self-sufficient enclaves which should be able to survive no matter how bad things get. They're just about ready. They'll take digitized copies of all our literature, our art, our music and our media, they'll take memories of us on Twitter and Facebook, and they'll mourn for us as the death of our planet consumes us. But if they've been smart about this, they'll live on, and in a few generations they may have even figured things out well enough to get back into space, and use their life-support tech to expand.

TL;DR: The only way that the history of the past half a century makes any sense to me at all is if the wealthy and powerful have known that collapse was inevitable this whole time, and they've been kicking the can down the road as far and as hard as they could this whole time, hoping that technology would allow us some small percentage of us to survive.","2015-10-17 21:42:50","50","75","0.81","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/3p5pcb/the_wealthy_and_powerful_have_known_about_the/","True","MrVisible","1747835105.606833","renewables now","manual"
"3pzgdt","renewable","action-oriented","Careers interested in renewable energy, and environmental-friendly cars(ev,phev,hv) whose studying business management in Korea.","Hi guys, I'm a 20- year old Korean Freshman in university whose interested in environmental problems caused by global warming and renewable energy. The momentum of my interest was watching ""The Unconvenient Truth"" made by Al Gore, and reading books about Elon Musk.

I now study at Kyungpook National University at Daegu, South Korea majoring in Business management.
I really want to work at Tesla, Solarcity in reference to my interest. Or some other companies that are related to the renewable energy and green-cars.

But for me right now, I've got no idea what I have to choice, do, and make efforts on. To be honest, I have no idea what I should do to enter the companies in the related areas. Plus I want to work especially in planning fields.
Whether I should study some fields related to the energy, engineerings? Can just learning about business management and getting a license related to financing and accounting help me find a job in the related fields?

Till now I just polished up English skills(with toeic 900s) , and tried to read books related to the fields of these renewable energy and the seriousness of environmental problems. Plus I tried to watch every video of Elon Musk.
I don't have much expertise in science and mathematics. Should I move my major to related fields? (Cf. in Korean high school educational systems, we have to make a choice whether to study liberal arts or natural science in grade 1 high school. I chose liberal arts and have no basic expertise in science and mathematics.

I just thought of my life in several ways. First choice would be studying Korean SAT in natural science version as to get expertise in science and mathematics, and go to a major which will be related to renewable energy or green-car(There are majors in Korean
universities that are called Green- Car major , renewable energy major)

Secondly, whether I should now try to study abroad in America. As there are much more universities and companies that are really related to these fields.
Third, I can do a double case study. My university has a major called energy engineering major.

Lastly, looking further and going to a graduate school. This year one of my seniors in the same major, university went to University of Pennsylvania where Elon Musk graduated
These are the four choices which I thought.

Also I want to ask although I just had the degree of business management, is it possible to work in companies related to REs and car companies.

Can you give me some advice? I have the passion to work in these areas but want to make the object clear right now to go for. Thank you.","2015-10-24 02:09:20","2","1","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/Renewable/comments/3pzgdt/careers_interested_in_renewable_energy_and/","True","green_ht","1747835631.7843819","renewables now","manual"
