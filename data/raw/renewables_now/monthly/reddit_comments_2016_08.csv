I teach at a major university, SE US, Chemical Engineering.  One of my students broke his neck in the spring, and is (at least in the short term) confined to a wheelchair.

The young man is a good student and has fair promise and drive for the field, but I am very concerned that his new situation will prevent him from finishing his studies and taking full advantage of his opportunity.

What are the best things I can do to help support him in this difficult time?  Are there grant programs that he might be able to make use of?  What can I do to help him get back to school and keep moving forward?  What timeframe for guys recovery and return to college do you think is realistic?  Do you think that he will be able to earn an opportunity to practice engineering in the field if he is permanently confined to a wheelchair?

Any personal experience or published studies that would help me to understand and mentor him would be very appreciated.  I thank you in advance for all your hard work in the area.","2016-08-30 12:36:25","10","StGeorgesArmy","1747856871.572774","renewables now","manual"

"d72js97","t3_50asaw","50asaw","science","scientific","Hello Professor,

Woman about to pursue PhD in STEM here. Are PWD STEM undergraduate degrees showing this lack of growth as well? Are PWD not pursuing doctorates in STEM or is the issue with retention within these programs? What are things that can be done at the undergraduate level to provide support for SWD and potentially increase STEM (and hopefully doctoral) degree retention? 

When attempting to increase retention of under-represented groups, support seems to be geared for increased involvement. Is there a better way to increase SWD involvement specifically? Are there accommodations that can be made to increase SWD participation/interest? I don't think I've ever even *seen* a research lab that would be comfortable for someone in a wheelchair. Many university labs I've seen are packed full with tight corners and high lab benches. If you don't mind sharing, how have you dealt with that personally as a chemist?

Thank you for the AMA. This isn't something I'd ever known about and will be keeping in mind as I pursue my own career in STEM.","2016-08-30 13:26:00","4","elatele","1747856871.582402","renewables now","manual"
"d72pkhn","t3_50asaw","50asaw","science","scientific","Hello professor, 

What you think of those who have mental disabilities (of all degrees of severity such as mild dyslexia to something more serious) participating in stem fields. I ask because, for the most part, stem subjects are known to be mentally rigorous. Yet at the same time there are many students who not only like the field but can succeed in it given that they have the proper motivation and help. 

I find the question difficult because on one hand, at certain level people must be treated like adults and they cannot be coddled into a program they cannot handle themselves. Yet on the other, cutting these people off deprives those fields of a significant source of talent. That is, assuming with the proper help such individuals would be able to excel.

In essence, should we be precluding a significant portion of the student population from the stem fields based on their perceived intelligence or results in those subjects without aid.","2016-08-30 15:45:22","5","[deleted]","1747856871.585472","renewables now","manual"

Former ASU student of yours here.  What are your thoughts on university provided assistants for students with disabilities in undergraduate lab courses?  For example, I have had students enrolled in Gen Chem who have lost the use of one or both of their arms.  The lecture is obviously not a problem, but the university provides an assistant for them in the lab who tends to end up performing all of the lab exercises while the student is supposed to direct, observe, and record data.  Ultimately, my impression is that these PWD students do not have a very fulfilling experience, and in some cases only arrive at the conclusion that they have no future in chemistry.  I can't help but think that there must be a more effective way to construct labs for these students, especially for those not simply filling a requirement but who intend to pursue a career in the field.","2016-08-30 14:30:12","3","waywardminer","1747856871.589428","renewables now","manual"

I've recently discovered, with professional help, that I have high functioning autism. I have also recently developed lupus/RA overlap. I have long struggled with college and have yet to complete a degree program. I have studied computer programming, WMDs (US Army CBRN), emergency medicine, and more. While I was in high school, I excelled in math and science, but deep depression nearly cost my educational career and my life.

"d72ret6","t3_50asaw","50asaw","science","scientific","Hi Professor! 
I'm a 4th year undergraduate who initially enrolled in engineering, with the intention of studying biomech.  I have a rare genetic disorder causing avascular necrosis of the bones in my pelvis and lumbar spine. I use a wheelchair, and due to the intense levels of pain I was in as well as mechanical access barriers (I ended up doing first year chemistry without an accessible lab bench and had to do titrations above my head, where I could not easily see the setup) I ended up switching to the relatively less demanding program of biology.

 Given the attitude that pervades a lot of STEM courses that if you can't hack it at the pace or level they expect of you, you might as well leave, how do we prevent students with disabilities from getting frustrated and leaving STEM programmes? I'm reminded of a first year eng physics professor who told the class on the first day that ""half of you will fail, and you will fail because you are not suited for engineering"". Needless to say, I found the programme extremely hostile to providing accommodations. 

Do you think this is changing? Over your career, have you noticed a change in the attitudes in STEM programmes regarding students with disabilities? I had friends in first year with learning disabilities who were so disheartened by the institutional attitudes that they left STEM entirely. Anecdotally, this seems like a serious problem -- is there any concern amongst the higher ups about the loss of potential scientists and engineers because of this?","2016-08-30 16:26:04","2","atshirtaway","1747856871.596257","renewables now","manual"

"d72kf2b","t3_50asaw","50asaw","science","scientific","Hello!

I am from Delaware originally and have a chronic illness that leaves me variably disabled (meaning I have my good days and bad... Sometimes I can run around, sometimes like today I'm borderline  bedridden by the pain). I am myself a STEM educator, most heavily environmental science. I lost my job last year in a layoff suspiciously after beginning to request medical accommodations. Have been struggling to find one ever since-  I'm still in the beginning of my career.

 I've been considering starting my own organization that would focus on teaching STEM to both adults and children with disabilities, including getting them out in nature going at our own pace. Despite living in a city I worry there won't be enough of an audience to make this a sustainable business model. After all, even if there were enough disabled to participate, midi of us can't afford all our medical bills much less payments for fun events.  

Where do you suggest I start with research and data to see if such a program is viable? The fact stop many of us are truly disabled but undocumented as such puts me at a loss. 

(And generally for everyone, what's your opinion on the ""to disclose when applying or not to disclose"" disability when you're asked on forms ""for statistics that will not be used in determining your eligibility"")

Sorry, i have not had time to read the full report as I am in mu break at work. I was wondering about the differences between PWD that have physical challenges that do not directly hinder the educational process and those and those with disabilities that do directly hinder the process. Ex. A person that needs a wheelchair vs. A Deaf person.

I am not objective in the issue, for I am a Deaf man in STEM (GIS analyst) myself. I know my undergrad had the extra challenge of being assigned double the reading of my peers when I was using remote captioning, and a list of other limitations on my education. I know part of GPA was due to not putting al of my effort into my education, but my being human and needing an excuse wants to blame my disability. I would like to further my education, but that is probably going to prevent me.","2016-08-30 13:46:07","1","xhuntus","1747856871.6025128","renewables now","manual"

I was wondering what opportunities there might be for a PWD that only has up to a Master's degree.

"d72vind","t3_50asaw","50asaw","science","scientific","Hello professor, completely sincere question: why is it necessary to have people with disabilities represented in STEM fields according to their proportion of the overall population?

This sounds like part and parcel of the recent push of leftist identity-politics to make every field representative of the overall population. So what if there are fewer people with disabilities, women, or ethnic minorities in STEM? As long as particular types of people aren't being forced into or out of particular occupations, why is it necessary to implement some sort of quota? Won't it have a net negative impact on the quality of STEM graduates if people are being artificially driven into the field based on their identity rather than their inherent aptitude or interest in the subject matter?

"d732fza","t3_50asaw","50asaw","science","scientific","Iama deaf woman who wanted to pursue biology but the lack of tutoring, captioning and other access to my materials or professors/TA's made it very difficult and demanding. I also struggled with the lab work because I had to have a partner and often it got awkward or uneven. I'm sad to say that yes I gave up and went for a psychology degree instead because it combined science and research without the heavy physical science or  math-based parts that I needed more support in. 

I'm also actually doubly disabled and didn't realize it back then. I have an energy disease that led to chronic fatigue and pain. The physical work of labs were very demanding both physically and cognitively.  I always had to decide if I was going to give in to fatigue and do a crappy job or push myself and blow out harder later.  I'd stumble out of labs feeling like I was hit by a truck, feeling drunk from fatigue and I'm unsure how I made it home in my car most days.  It would have been nice to live on campus or not to have to work a 20-30 hour a week job on top to make ends meet too. 

Scholarships for the disabled and loan forgiveness for disabled students needs to be taken into account and improved upon. I barely got money from the state vocational rehab for books ($400 a semester), I had to live off campus with my parents driving back and forth 40 mins in Atlanta traffic. I had to take out student loans so I wouldn't be broke while I went to school. I had to study while at my part time (also physically demanding) job because it's hard for disabled people to find jobs and manual labor was all I was qualified for. It was so tiring between hr cognitive load from being deaf and my physical disease.  I took six years to finish school and that was after a change in my major more than half through.
