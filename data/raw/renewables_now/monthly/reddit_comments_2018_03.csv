Every problem you listed is directly attributable to this above quote. Once our numbers get too big, the planetary management that is required to prevent trashing the place becomes too exponential. The pile of shit is too deep. 

Most of us believe that all of our new technologies will solve all of our problems, at scale. We assume that just because the concept of no-till exists, farmers all over the world will suddenly go ""oh, tilling is bad!"" and get rid of their farming equipment and stop tilling en masse. It just doesn't work that way. Humans don't change their habits unless a direct clear and present danger exists to force change. 

It's all just a fantasy. One that's about to come crashing down, really fucking hard. The myth of modernity is progress, and when enough people realize it's a myth, and that their quality of life (in our society's terms) is going to crash down around them, the gnashing of teeth of the masses will be incomprehensible. All of our value as humans is tied up in this materialistic monetary system, so when the system dies, a lot of people will want to die with it. Humans will defend psychotic systems to the bitter fucking end if it's all they've ever known AND that system is associated with how they get their food, shelter, and social life. Ain't no escaping the Roman empire this time. 

Anyone know of cheap farming land I could buy? Like, 10K? In the middle of nowhere? That also won't get so hot in the next 30 years that all my crop's pollen denatures and I starve to death? Just kidding. ","2018-03-06 19:00:16","17","[deleted]","1747887873.40713","renewables now","manual"
