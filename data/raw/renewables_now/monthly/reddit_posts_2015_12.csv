If we screw up and can't grow food, or process water for drinking, etc, the Earth /will/ continue on without us.  Life /will/ adapt.  We, humans, are insignificant.

2. We are going to run out of cheap oil.  Easy to get to oil.  Easy to process oil.  We can only change the climate so much from oil if there is only so much oil, and we are going to, effectively, run out.  Additionally, the market already supports fracking and tar sands, both of which are expensive and inefficient.  Now we're trying to buy oil from Iran while the price of oil is low.  This is as good a deal as we are likely to ever get.

3. Many of our power plants use [prodigious amounts of non-renewable energy](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/index.html) (2014, 3_1).  Those that do use renewable energy, like hydroelectric dams, do untold amounts of damage to the environment.  We stopped producing nuclear reactors in the 80's due to well intended, but erroneously founded fears.

4. The US currently has only ~[300](http://www.bna.com/us-desalination-industry-n17179876105/) desalinization plants online.  States have already started arguing over water rights.

5. Ocean acidity?  Over fishing?  If you think the animals going extinct due to poaching is bad, the 2006 numbers for over fishing called the ball at, ""all salt-water fish to be extinct by 2048."" ([NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/science/03fish.html), [Paywall Journal](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5800/787.short))  Given that technology and progress improve exponentially, I reasonably surmise 2048 is optimistic, but I don't have access to the actual paper.  Be the actual date in 2050, 2025, or 2100, it falls under the same category as oil.  ""Enough to hurt.""

6. We shifted from an industrial and production based economy towards a consumer based economy after WWII ([Quora Discussion](https://www.quora.com/When-and-how-did-the-US-make-the-shift-to-consumer-spending-as-a-leading-economic-indicator-replacing-manufacturing-production-and-exports)).  Our personal wealth is now tied directly to our dispensable income.  Contemplate the impact of rising oil prices while you compare this winter's $2/gal to last summer's $5/gal.  To be fair, this issue is the most complex and includes everything from the baby boomers' effects on the job and housing markets, erasure of the middle class, general lack of savings and/or investments, political decisions regarding fair trade/open markets, and countless other facets.

tl:dr: We are a resilient species to the point of stupidity.  At this rate, we are going to lose a game of, ""Don't Go Extinct,"" to a cascade of our own failures.

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER·MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2015

I see your questions.

Each and every time I post on my Facebook page or tweet about my crusade for a clean energy future, I see them.

There are always a few of you, asking why we should care about the temperature rising, or questioning the science of climate change.

I want you to know that I hear you. Even those of you who say renewable energy is a conspiracy. Even those who say climate change is a hoax. Even those of you who use four letter words.
I've heard all of your questions, and now I have three questions for you.

Let's put climate change aside for a minute. In fact, let's assume you're right.

First - do you believe it is acceptable that 7 million people die every year from pollution? That's more than murders, suicides, and car accidents - combined.

Every day, 19,000 people die from pollution from fossil fuels. Do you accept those deaths? Do you accept that children all over the world have to grow up breathing with inhalers?

Now, my second question: do you believe coal and oil will be the fuels of the future?

Besides the fact that fossil fuels destroy our lungs, everyone agrees that eventually they will run out. What's your plan then?

I, personally, want a plan. I don't want to be like the last horse and buggy salesman who was holding out as cars took over the roads. I don't want to be the last investor in Blockbuster as Netflix emerged. That's exactly what is going to happen to fossil fuels.

A clean energy future is a wise investment, and anyone who tells you otherwise is either wrong, or lying. Either way, I wouldn't take their investment advice.

Renewable energy is great for the economy, and you don't have to take my word for it. California has some of the most revolutionary environmental laws in the United States, we get 40% of our power from renewables, and we are 40% more energy efficient than the rest of the country. We were an early-adopter of a clean energy future.

Our economy has not suffered. In fact, our economy in California is growing faster than the U.S. economy. We lead the nation in manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, entertainment, high tech, biotech, and, of course, green tech.

I have a final question, and it will take some imagination.
There are two doors. Behind Door Number One is a completely sealed room, with a regular, gasoline-fueled car. Behind Door Number Two is an identical, completely sealed room, with an electric car. Both engines are running full blast.

I want you to pick a door to open, and enter the room and shut the door behind you. You have to stay in the room you choose for one hour. You cannot turn off the engine. You do not get a gas mask.
I'm guessing you chose the Door Number Two, with the electric car, right? Door number one is a fatal choice - who would ever want to breathe those fumes?

This is the choice the world is making right now.

To use one of the four-letter words all of you commenters love, I don't give a damn if you believe in climate change. I couldn’t care less if you're concerned about temperatures rising or melting glaciers. It doesn't matter to me which of us is right about the science.

I just hope that you'll join me in opening Door Number Two, to a smarter, cleaner, healthier, more profitable energy future.","2015-12-12 07:32:37","781","69","0.95","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/3whnlr/arnold_schwarzenegger_i_dont_give_a_if_we_agree/","True","BlankVerse","1747838448.637988","renewables now","manual"
