"e1v9itv","t3_8wevnf","8wevnf","climatechange","action-oriented","Well, the thing with nuclear is that while in terms of CO2 emissions, it is better than coal or natural gas, it has high startup costs, and the aging reactors are not being replaced, and there isn't a lot of investment when startup costs for gas are still cheap. There is a lot to be said about the possibilities, modular reactors and NuScale, LIFTR, and even experimental fusion reactors in EU set to come online next 10-20 years. Unfortunately with nuke there is an association with bombs and meltdowns that has been difficult to overcome, and the research into the improvements that should have been made had gov funding cut long ago so we're in this weird limbo where better, safer nuclear should be possible but we're behind on making it happen meanwhile the existing reactors are being pushed past their life expectancy.

So to create enough dispatchable power to supplant a majority renewable energy mix the options remaining are large scale storage, and gas/coal/oil. The vast majority of energy storage is hydro, think reservoir like Hoover dam, which as you noted are geographically limited (interesting things are being done with CSP+TES but that's also geographically limited and still maturing.) Grid scale batteries are, as you also noted under transportation, not quite ready yet, but utilities are looking into the benefits besides just supporting renewables of large scale storage, and there are at least incentives to be had and research being done.

So we're back to coal and gas and CO2. BUT there could be no CO2, if carbon capture and sequestration were applied at existing or new nat gas plants (and coal, but currently gas is just cheaper.) We again get back to higher startup costs. No one is buying a nat gas turbine with an expensive, experimental CCS system if they don't have to.

So, the solution that I hear often as the best solution to all of this, and that I believe is the best solution despite my technical background, is not a technical solution, it is a political/economic solution. A price on carbon either via a direct carbon tax or cap and trade system incentivizes nuclear research and breaking ground on new nuclear plants. It makes renewables+storage, and gas+CCS more competitive with gas/coal alone and it can be used to establish funds to deal with the very real and already happening effects of climate change that we are facing. The way I look at it, these costs are currently a handout we give to every polluting industry anyway.

One last part of the solution, which is a big one, are efficiency improvements, which actually account for a fair share of emissions reductions at national/local levels. These are great, important, and should be made wherever possible on new stuff or when old stuff is at the end of it's life. But climate change is a global problem and the effects will be global, and to, for example, replace a still-usable CFL bulb with an LED bulb in the U.S., when many parts of the developing world maybe still working on access to electric lighting, is a narrow-minded improvement which may create more waste in the long run, and make things worse for those people which will be impacted first and most severely by climate change (e.g. the developing world.)

tl;dr: Tax carbon, buy an LED bulb, ship it to a remote village in Africa.","2018-07-06 02:03:26","8","SpreadableFruit","1747892803.079582","renewables now","manual"
"e1vrlp3","t3_8wevnf","8wevnf","climatechange","action-oriented","I believe power generation should be based on renewable resources appropriate for the area. Nuclear is efficient but the startup-cost and handling of waste is extremely expensive and we need world-wide change right now.

Solar power is cheap and easy in startup and a great alternative for sunny areas, and there are many giant solar parks being built right now. 

Transportation: smaller vehicles can be electrical, the technology already exists. Trucks can be driven on biodiesel, and there are several exciting new ways of producing it.

I'm Swedish so my perspective on this is biased by that of course. My country doesn't use coal for energy and it baffles me that other rich countries still do. The alternatives exist - why not use them?

Gas is not a good alternative in the long run, it's still a fossil fuel. ","2018-07-06 09:20:31","7","[deleted]","1747892803.082379","renewables now","manual"

"e1vay84","t3_8wevnf","8wevnf","climatechange","action-oriented","I don't have statistics on this, but I have a strong sense that in the developed world we're living through an epochal natural-gas boom. If you want to bet on a generation technology that will create maximum future gigawatt-hours, bet on gas.

But at least until very recently, coal has remained a giant contributor in the developing world. As of 10 years ago, coal was still being shipped across oceans to be used as fuel (and might still be today). Presumably gas will one day render coal a strictly local fuel — and maybe that's starting to happen already, I haven't followed energy markets closely for several years now. 

I agree with /u/SpreadableFruit's comments on nuclear power. The investment environment there is just brutal. Do not bet.

I'm somewhat more skeptical than /u/SpreadableFruit is regarding efficiency improvements, since I think the [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) is likely to apply in the case of a broadly-available resource like power. But someone who made a strong case that ruled out Jevons for the future power market could influence my thinking on that.

I agree that the real game-changing technology is carbon sequestration. But in my view, broad availability of that technology is still decades in the future. I wouldn't get too excited about it unless my investment horizon extended to about 2060.","2018-07-06 02:28:50","2","DocHarford","1747892803.087002","renewables now","manual"
"e1vbyal","t3_8wevnf","8wevnf","climatechange","action-oriented","**So the largest two contributors to green house gases like carbon dioxide are power generation and transportation**

There is some debate about this. The EPA and UN have different accounting techniques and the UN puts agriculture above transportation in emission equivalents. 

If you transport a cow, the UN calls its agriculture and the EPA calls it transportation. 

With cars moving toward EV, agriculture looms bigger going forward. ","2018-07-06 02:46:45","2","buddhist62","1747892803.0900538","renewables now","manual"
"e1sr9xa","t3_8w4tvr","8w4tvr","sustainability","action-oriented","Hey Dave!!

  I’m a new sub, so this is the first one of your posts I’m reading. I read through about half of the articles before I had to take a break, so this post isn’t as much about the content, but rather the context of the post. I wanted to first say what an amazing job you’ve done collecting these sources. It is imperative that we know the information presented here, and because it’s not sexy enough to sell papers, I don’t think it gets presented often. This leads me to a couple questions.   
  
  1. How can I assist you in doing what you’re doing? I truly believe presenting facts in the face of folly is important, and if I can help, I want to. 
  
  2. How best can we share this information? Have you found a way that works best?  
   
  I hope these questions find you well, and I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks again.
