It's not the end of the world, and whatever happened coal and other fossil fuels had to end, and renewables are fantastic, however it has been a bit terrible how certain green groups have utterly misrepresented the risks of nuclear power and stifled any rational debate on this issue. 

That said, for a bunch of reasons, new nuclear is far more expensive than new renewables now, so the horse has bolted. ","2018-09-12 04:11:03","3","wilful","1747897343.583754","renewables now","manual"
"e5ucve8","t3_9f4gqb","9f4gqb","climate","scientific","Follow the time line, Germany closed the door on nukes just after they witnessed what happened at Fukushima , Japan, and with good reason.  The legacy of Fukushima will last essentially forever.  With increasing natural disasters combined with SLR and a propensity in industry for greed at any cost, nukes sound like a bad idea.  On the other hand solar and wind pose little or no negative effects on our environment. ","2018-09-12 13:41:29","2","[deleted]","1747897343.587475","renewables now","manual"
