If a guy can get a Phd saying there are multiple universes, and another guy can get a Phd studying life after death, then what fucking practical use are they? When Cern ""proved"" the Higgs Boson particle, the only thing they proved was the validation of their overpaid jobs. Theory is just theory and shouldn't be confused with reality.

I'm sorry, but am I supposed to respect your anti-knowledge, anti-science stance?

You clearly have no idea what a ""theory"" really means in science.  A theory doesn't mean ""A random guess that someone just made up"" - it means ""A set of scientific laws that have been been proven by a huge amount of experiment and criticism by other scientists.""

Why do we have jet planes that travel half the speed of sound across the sky?  Without the theory of aerodynamics, the theory of combustion and all sorts of other theories going back to Maxwell's Equations and beyond, we wouldn't have airplanes at all.

Why do we have the very internet we are talking about?  It's the joining of a huge number of theories involving electricity, semiconductors, even quantum mechanics. 

Heck, without the Theory of Relativity, we wouldn't have GPS.

If there's any reason at all that humans exist, it is to find out how the world really works.  

> Our schools are teaching kids that everything is the fault of over-privileged white male heterosexuals.

It is our _leaders_ who are failing us.  It is our leaders who refuse to meet the challenges like climate change and the ongoing ecocide that is causing the collapse.  And yes, all of our so-called leaders are over-privileged and most are white heterosexuals, but the problem is not their race or gender _but their refusal to act in the face of an overwhelming crisis._","2018-01-12 15:50:55","23","[deleted]","1747885037.6101801","renewables now","manual"

There's nothing renewable about solar cells or wind powered turbines. You're still mining for metals and other substances to build these things. It still has to be transported on roads that are probably paved with asphalt, in trucks powered on diesel. 


The only sustainable power sources either tap geographical features- hydroelectric dams are fairly reliable but do have ecological impact in the form of disrupted fish patterns, geothermal is too but you don't get too many places where that is viable- or has 'nuclear' in the name- and while nuclear could conceivably be depleted, it would still, by estimates, give us a few hundred years to sort ourselves out.","2018-01-12 17:49:18","2","[deleted]","1747885037.63043","renewables now","manual"

Also existing solar panels don't stop working after 30 years they are just not as efficient. 

So your anti academic rants asside, the articles you see in papers are generally ginned up for the public otherwise no one would read it. They are the equivalent of click bate. 

Most academics who study the subject use a combination of nuclear, mulit form solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, bio, and small amounts of carbon based power sources. The fact is that we could be putting significantly less carbon in the atmosphere and generation the same amount of power today with already available technology. 

What prevents this from happening is combination of shortsighted capitalism, and good old fashioned corruption.

"dt4pw33","t3_7rd05s","7rd05s","renewable","action-oriented","I'm not a fan of Arcadia's wind offering, however I am intrigued by their [community solar offering](https://solar.arcadiapower.com/).

They get a lot of their wind REC's from [Texas](http://faq.arcadiapower.com/knowledge_base/topics/where-are-the-wind-farms).  Texas is massively oversupplied with wind, so much so that the [price of a REC is under $1](http://www.clearenergybrokerage.com/texas-rec-prices-stall-beneath-1mwh-amid-bearish-supply-demand-factors/).  One REC is equal to 1 megawatt hour (or 1,000 kilowatt hours) of electricity, which to you at retail costs over $100.  There is no demand for the RECs they are procuring for you so your account with them doesn't increase demand for wind power.  I haven't researched their other sites, however, after seeing the situation in Texas I stopped.  That is why they are able to offer a free tier.  

Note, some people are against RECs in general.  I am not.  Its just that in this case it appears the RECs have no value because of over supply.

On the other hand the claims for their community solar offering look very attractive.  The idea behind community solar is you subscribe to panels on someone else's roof.  In Arcadia's case you pay upfront and receive the output for a period of 10 years.  Each month you get credit for what that panel has generated and it shows up on your bill (unlike the wind offering).  That last is crucial, that it shows up on your bill means the power company has paid the owner of the solar panel. 

They say on average you save a little bit each month after averaging out over the 10 year period.  The solar offering isn't nationwide but it is available at a large number of utilities.  If you move the contract can follow you to your new residence, if it is within the territory of one of their participating utilities.  If you move outside their terms say they'll try to resell your obligation but you are on the hook if they can't.  

I haven't done it myself since I have panels on my own roof.  But it sounds like an interesting offer to someone interested in solar who lives in an apartment or can't put them on their own roof.","2018-01-23 20:15:42","2","thinkcontext","1747885380.856042","renewables now","manual"
