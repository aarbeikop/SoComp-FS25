"f055hfl","t3_d3ni9d","d3ni9d","collapse","skeptical","r/climate...ahem, sometimes it's more annoying than denial. I'm 42 and have watched the decadal climate shenanigans in bemusement. Humans have decided to whore themselves to our economic structure and will not stop. Indeed the systems we create demand to be defended against interference. My reading of Google has me in agreement with you, I see every reason to believe that of them. As for fakebook, I wouldn't go near it. It's not allowed in my house.....such a conversation starter when guests arrive lol. As our future takes form we can now begin to chart our path into the Orwellian abyss of dystopian social control as systems feeders and single serve friends, while the world unravels around us and the diaphanous shroud lifts to reveal the horror of what we have done. I often wonder how millennial see and interpret this shit show, I mean I have 2 myself, but they're different because I never lied to them. If their friends are anything to go by, it must be quite a shock to be redpilled.","2019-09-13 19:26:14","4","happygloaming","1747925816.57543","renewables now","manual"
"f05yerk","t3_d3ni9d","d3ni9d","collapse","skeptical","xennial checking in, all these things re: climate were being discussed when in i was in elementary school, the realistic perspective now is that we missed the boat on reversing the trend back in the 70s, but nowhere along the way at any point has there been any mainstream penetration of the ideas that would be required to actually make a difference.

some of it's really hard, how do you degrow human civilization at large? shrug. how can a movement that per its objective reduces its power and ability to fight against its enemy — state capitalism and the petroleum economy? shrug. anything short of absurdly violent revolution and what would basically amount to ecofascism from most people's perspectives seems like wasted effort. 

but then there's stuff that's actually ... really easy? plastic bags. what do we do about plastic bags. well, you just carry a fucking backpack! try it! need to carry things but you don't have enough arm space to pull it off? carry a fucking backpack! put the shit in a backpack you fucking idiots! it's a fake problem!

straws. well people don't really like paper straws. guess what? YOU DON'T NEED A FUCKING STRAW AT ALL DRINK OUT OF A GLASS YOU FUCKING IDIOT. fake problem.

and you can actually extend this line of thinking pretty far out, and if people would just .. accept the fact that you don't need shit you don't fucking need we might have a fighting chance of mitigation, but no, we tussle back and forth over **fucking straws** while the phytoplankton die out and greenland fucking burns.

my dad's a boomer who was way ahead of the curve on climate change compared to the general population and even people who were keen on the subject so i've viewed the present situation as fait accompi for quite a while, even as we actually see the feedback loops really start to kick in presently.

in a way, it's nice because i'm largely inured to whats going on because of lifelong exposure to the reality of the situation. it's terrifying but i've been chewing on the terror for long enough and hedged my bets vis a vis career, family, credit score, retirement funds, etc. to live an actually pretty low stress lifestyle as a result. 'why don't you live up to your potential', fuck you, idiot - have fun with your kids and your grey hair and your car payment, i'll ride out the twilight for what its worth free from your insane, manufactured lifestyle obligations. i've won my bets, feels bad but ... feels good, too.","2019-09-14 01:10:37","2","[deleted]","1747925816.5812428","renewables now","manual"

So now you're going to weasel words when you realize that you're promoting lies. 

> I base these beliefs on years of cynicism, not any definitive proof. Definitive proof is in short supply these days, and even if you find it, it gets totally ignored.

Which is exactly what you do to every piece of evidence that contradicts your beliefs.","2019-09-13 13:11:21","-1","[deleted]","1747925816.588244","renewables now","manual"
