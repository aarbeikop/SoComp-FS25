3. Start up cycling items (much better than recycling) and buy the least amount of stuff possible.

"e7ilzsx","t3_9mzouo","9mzouo","climatechange","action-oriented","If you spend just a little time reading past posts in this forum, you'll see that this question is a constant refrain here. The frequency with which this question arises — plus the reuse of similar themes, and sometimes language — strongly suggests the work of bots or other automated/rote posting accounts...on *some* occasions. 

So: Repeating here my comment from [another post on a similar topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/95p77y/what_else_can_i_do_to_help/e3ul7wo/):

***

In a word, the solution is: Adaptation.

Which people are pretty good at in the long run, as long as we have access to some key tools: science, technology, finance, and a modest amount of global coordination.

Technology is a big one. Eventually technology will develop solutions to three problems:

1) Making fossil fuels a minor source of energy supply, instead of a major one like they are now.

2) Finding a way to extract and sequester the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

3) Making the global climate a tunable environment, like a laboratory or a manmade lake or your bedroom.

The question is, how quickly will these problems encounter technological fixes? #3 probably isn't happening in this century, but seems possible for the next. #1 and #2 are unpredictable, but it's reasonable to guess that major strides will be made in this century.

In the meantime, technology will also be needed to enable populations to adjust to some local phenomena:

1) Sea-level rise, by investing in coastal defense. (A technology which has existed for millennia.)

2) Ocean acidification.

3) Ecosystem pressures, possibly including some collapses. These could be severe, although note that ecosystems have collapsed in the past and civilization has adjusted well enough to those.

4) A higher-energy troposphere, which might mean more severe storms.

The financial system is an integral part of developing the necessary technologies, making the necessary investments, and possibly developing the necessary global coordination. In fact, for now burning fossil fuels is probably also an integral part of that process.

There's more than technology needed, of course. There's also a great need to amass huge amounts of data — so climate risks and fixes can be properly modeled and priced, for instance. Most of that data isn't available now, but amassing it in the future is another part of the solution.

But again, the solution condensed into a single word is: Adaptation. Which people are pretty good at, once a pressing need develops. If you are very concerned about climate risks, then you'll be constantly improving capacities to adapt — yours, and your society's.

There may in fact be no point in your living or starting a family, but the climate is not one of the top hundred most important influences on that decision. It might not even be in the top thousand. Its influence could easily be negligible.

Anyone who decides not to start a family will get full encouragement from me; I think plenty of people make ill-considered decisions about that. But regardless of my encouragement, you should invest in whatever makes you feel happy and fulfilled, and enables you to play a constructive role in helping other people reach their goals.

Also here's another comment on a similar topic:

[It's fair to say that technology will continue to advance, and the problem of excess atmospheric CO2 is not insoluble in principle. Inevitably one day we'll have the ability to tune the composition of the atmosphere, if we wish. But the main complication is: We have a lot of other civilization-level problems to solve, many of them extremely urgent, and the vast majority of our technological resources are going to be dedicated to addressing those problems (as they should be).](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/97rzul/technology_might_still_save_us/e4aj79h/).

And this one too:

[The endgame — for the second half of the 21st century, let's say — is: Global economic growth will slowly converge with its historical average. Technology advances will continue to accelerate mildly. These trends will continue to be partially obscured by exogenous shocks of varying disruptiveness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e6700hr/)

And amplifying that one:

[Really, climate change is not greatly different than a lot of exogenous shocks that have existed for centuries, and which we tend to feel (and measure) in economic conditions first. My answer is just a summary of economic orthodoxy of the post-WWII era — there's nothing original in it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e672k83/)

And more about the process of climate adaptation:

[Adaptation is unquestionably the best strategy for confronting climate issues — at least until the global climate system is understood well enough to be predictably altered via relatively modest steps. (An achievement which is at least several decades in the future, maybe a century.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9j2oum/deep_adaption_in_bloomberg_businessweek/e6r09av/)","2018-10-10 15:11:55","9","DocHarford","1747901265.794253","renewables now","manual"

After moving up there for 10 yrs I went back to grad school for an MS in Global Energy Management (now considering an MJ Energy Law) and transitioned to a renewable fuel producer. I'm now the North American technical expert within my global company. Yes, we sell diesel fuel, but it's renewable diesel (not biodiesel) and the fuel's carbon footprint is \~80% lower than fossil diesel, which provides a great bridge while other renewables are still being developed... and our company has actually been ranked the second most sustainable company in the world (behind a French software company). I've made the jump, so I feel a little qualified to comment here.

First, have a plan.  Your desire to do good is awesome, but having a plan is a multiplier... and without a plan your risk is huge.

Wanting to make a difference is good. I get it. But make sure you have somewhere to land before you jump. Trust me, I walked away from a director role in upstream O&G with no plan and nowhere to go, and it's not a good feeling. I took a ""filler"" role for a year just to pay bills before I found my dream role. Just being in SF isn't good enough.

You need to network your ass off. You need to know what niche of the renewable world you want to go into and you need to meet everyone you can in that space. Can you name five companies you'd like to work for and at least one or two people at each company who could help you? Once you meet them, you need to (respectfully) stay on their radar.  You need to know who they work for, what they do, and how you could benefit their bottom line. No matter how much you want to save the world, you're also wanting to fit into a company that needs to be profitable, so you need to very articulately be able to talk about how you will benefit a bottom line and make them better.

Beyond the business side, there's the personal passion. Companies do want passionate people who are willing to go the extra mile to make the company better. You need to also show that you're passionate about the cause, because people 'wanting' to get into renewable energy are probably a dime a dozen. You need to stand out. Pick an industry niche (wind, solar, bio, geothermal, tidal, etc) and concentrate on it. Don't walk into an interview with a ""Well, you're cleaner than fossil fuel, so I want to play"" mindset. Go into an interview saying, ""I understand the niche you operate in, I know that these are your advantages, these are your challenges, I understand the history of this niche, this is where most feel it's going, and here's how I fit into all of that.""

Beyond that there are legislative / policy considerations - where will cleaner tech be mandated first, what will it look like, etc.

Then there's the money side - what technology will be funded well over the next years to decade and what will be starved out...

Lots of thoughts here. Feel free to PM me if you want. Clean energy, especially in CA, is growing, but there are a lot of intricacies that most people don't grasp, which makes them think it's ""easy.""

The key is to transition to energy generation sources that do not pollute, and propulsion systems that do not emit. There are many great ideas and concepts already out there. 

The key is to implement and get to 100% renewable energy. To make sure all cars, trains, planes and ships are run on electricity, fuel cells, and batteries. To make sure all buildings run on clean energy and no longer emit damaging greenhouse gases.

Currently in the U.S., a sizeable majority of *[Republicans](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/june-2017-meeting-analysis-1127.pdf)* in Congress are very receptive to the idea of [a carbon fee with revenue returned as an equitable dividend to households](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy), and are just waiting for their constituents to [lobby them](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf) to make it happen. It shouldn't be that hard since a majority of Americans in [literally every Congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&type=value&geo=cd) and [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) supports a carbon tax (which [does actually matter](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651)) and we only need a 2/3rds majority to overrule a presidential veto. Last I checked, the median Republican district had about 60 active volunteers [lobbying their Rep](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) for CF&D, and we probably need more like 160-200. NY-27, NY-21, NY-22, NY-24, NY-01, and NY-23 (in that order) or NJ-02, NJ-03, NJ-04 all could use more volunteers, which--if you're interested--you could recruit on the weekends by [giving presentations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/presentations/) or [tabling](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/tabling/). 

However, since you have a well-paying corporate job your talents might be better spent [getting endorsements from businesses](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/endorsements/) who support [CF&D](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/). There are hundreds of businesses that have already [signed their support](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/), and politicians famously care about their district's business interests. You can either recruit businesses in your own area, a nearby district in need (as listed above) or start recruiting businesses in the most ""in-need"" district, maybe IL-16, OH-04, or PA-12. 

If you *really* don't believe our political system can pass a carbon tax even with optimal number of volunteers in each district, probably the best use of your time would be to move to [Ohio](https://ballotpedia.org/Initiated_state_statute) and get [Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) on the ballot, which [would have a decent chance of passing](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aaron-hamlin-voting-reform/) and would tend to elect more moderates who could truly represent the will of the people.

In other words, think hard before you quit a well-paying job. There are probably other ways to help as well.

A second remark: Your description sounds like the wide-spread ""yes, but"" answer to climate change: *Yes, we should do something about climate change, but [some other thing first]* The 'some other thing first' part often reveals a person's true priority (getting rid of capitalism, create more jobs, remain competitive, increase GDP, whatever).

Maybe, it's worth considering whether both conditions have to be met, initially. Dropping the California requirement might help to get a foot in the door of the industry, so you have better chance to network professionally. Dropping the climate change requirement might help you to move to California, first, so you can then start to network in the industry locally.

The 70s saw some resurgence of environmental conservation but it wasn't even close to setting up the Earth of 50 years in the future. We saw an indian cry in commercials and recycling slowly become accepted (when in fact it was just shipped to China and buried) we gave a hoot and this is what it got us 60 years later.

If we had 60 years now we wouldn't do anything today because the politicians and the wealthiest nations and individuals figured they wouldn't be around. Their grandchildren are now around and starting to run things but we now know 50 years ago that we had about 50 years. Now we are saying we have 10 years but really we ran out of time decades ago.

Nothing really helped but civilization couldn't really go without cars and heat and water and making and selling and shipping and recycling and throwing away things so it just went on but with no real alternative anyway.

>This will never happen, period.

This level of reduction won't happen that quickly save a mass global revolution and subsequent mobilization, a transformational process which in itself will produce untold additional emissions and climate forcing. 

Missing from your list, and from the media, is that the IPCC admits that even with such a drastic reduction in emissions, we would still require carbon dioxide *removal* efforts to achieve net negative emissions to *return* the Earth back to a 1.5c outcome after a peak. And of course the level required is conservative. 

The simple fact is that the scientific consensus is that we're already committed to 1.5c with present levels of greenhouse gasses. And an additional 0.5c should be considered conservative because these models don't account for natural feedback loops. Including albedo effect from ice cap and glacial melt alone, we're likely already committed to a further 1.5c warming.","2018-10-09 21:46:12","1","[deleted]","1747902438.491337","renewables now","manual"

The real success plan is 200% of global electricity being generated with renewables.  This allows surpluses to be converted into hydrogen/ammonia and so fuel vehicles including planes.

A viable future doesn't require less energy, and every suggestion that our survival depends on less consumption is a defeatist absurdity that will have no buy-in.  Renewables are cheaper than FFs.  The hydrogen/ammonia produced by surplus electricity is cheaper than FFs in energy equivalent means.  The only people opposed to this are the very small minority that want to keep you enslaved to expensive energy.

IPCC have made very stupid and worthless recommendations in this report.","2018-10-09 15:41:52","0","Godspiral","1747902438.492806","renewables now","manual"

Of course, ""runaway hothouse"" isn't really what it sounds like (common mistake to draw a straight or exponential dotted line on a graph forecasting the future). It's a period of flux from the old stable state (the only world climate habitable for civilization) to the next stable state: one that homo sapiens never lived in, one that we likely won't make it to, and one that will put evolutionary pressure on any surviving populations resulting in the end of homo sapiens one way or the other.","2018-10-07 20:19:02","6","HulkSmashHulkRegret","1747902738.00209","renewables now","manual"
