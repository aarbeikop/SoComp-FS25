The world is now hyper-connected (far more so now than in previous decades), it is a complex dynamic system that is prone to shocks and positive feedback loops that very rapidly amplify negative market events. In financial markets, this is known as systemic risk and [financial contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_contagion).

In addition, competition has resulted in a modern society that is becoming increasingly optimised and less resilient each year. We have just-in-time supply chains with almost zero buffer and  redundancy is being been minimised everywhere because redundancy adds cost (e.g. lack of redundant transformers in power distribution networks, minimal excess food supplies in cities, massive monoculture crops, etc). Compare this to previous ages when there were fewer people, easier access to resources and looser connections between nations.

If this continues, every year will see us more susceptible to a rapid collapse.
