"362m2j","collapse","skeptical","Are we being collapsed?","We have the technology and education systems to control our birth rate, power our world many times over from renewable energy, allow people regardless of language to talk to each other in near real time and feed ourselves sustainably.

We are just now on the brink or tipping point between collapse and utopia.

So what's holding us back, awareness, ignorance, corruption, old big dirty energy, non-democratic 'block' voting systems, the fear of change, biased media corporations?

I don't get it we have all the tools we need to fix the majority of our big problems but we seem to be blocked/blind from making the changes we could all do to make a big difference?

What's your view, is it that a change to renewable and sustainable living would damage our consumer based economy or that we just need a critical mass or threshold to tip us away from a collapse scenario and into a sustainable one?","2015-05-15 15:59:20","20","69","0.76","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/362m2j/are_we_being_collapsed/","True","Arowx","1747825706.3235772","renewables now","manual"
