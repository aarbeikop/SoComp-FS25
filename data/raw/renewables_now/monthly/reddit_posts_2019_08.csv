// edit: i had disconnected from social media but just got back to it. I attended the UN Climate Summit, and the majority of countries proposals involved renewable energy from wind and solar. china, and India didn’t commit to any changes in their emissions. slowly but steady we are shifting economies and resources!","2019-08-16 17:38:34","4","30","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cr9r5m/what_are_some_good_individual_actions_that_can/","True","bs0world","1747923472.3279061","renewables now","manual"
"co129p","renewable","action-oriented","What are some pressing issues with wind energy today that are calling for a revamp of the electric grid?","Hello, all

I'd like to hear from you - in case you work with or research about wind energy - the ""hot"" topics involving this renewable energy nowadays? 

More specifically, I'm interested in how areas that were doing just fine without wind energy are now faring with the possible surplus of energy. 

For instance, for years on end, hydropower was the type of energy that would be converted into electricity to power the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and parts of British Columbia in Canada. That area, the Pacific Northwest, has a fairly steady amount of running water all year long (rain + snow melting). Now, the PNW is also home to large wind farms whose output will go straight into the grid as soon as it is produced. But the grid can't take all the energy from all sources all the time. The result of that is hydroelectric operation companies paying wind farms to turn off their turbines when the water level is so high that is must be either passed through the turbines or spilled. 

This, however, is just one of the quandaries that come along with new uncertain sources of renewable energy.

If you have any material - peer-reviewed, newspaper- or magazine-published, a website you follow, or just your experience - I'd like if you could share it in here.
