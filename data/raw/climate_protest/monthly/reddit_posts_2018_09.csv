"9dg0ru","climatechange","action-oriented","Let's act!","Lately, many redditors have created posts to ask what can be done to really create an impact in our fight against climate change. So far, our protests and marches have created some awareness but have not resulted in much impact. We can't rely on our leaders to change something because they just won't.

Aside from being a fervent supporter in the climate change fight, I am a corporate finance adviser by profession and I know things that could be described as ""behind the scenes"", that layman would not normally see. Did you know that your banks, insurance companies, pension companies all invest your hard-earned coins in funds that in turn invest heavily in oil companies. Why? Because they are profit maximizing companies and these investment give them maximum profit. So, why would renewable energy bother to them? Oil is a decreasing supply commodity. Falling supply means higher price. So, you got it.

I pondered over the problem from a financial perspective and I found a system where we can make a much bigger impact than just desperately marching and trying to convince our governments to act. Investment shape the world we live in. If we all join hands and invest together in what we believe in, we will yield much higher results. We will have a higher power to convince. We need to upgrade from being scattered tribes to becoming an empire. Then we will stand a chance to create change. And above all, we will receive a much higher return than all of us investing in our own solar plants.

I don't want to make this post too long so I'll cut through the details. The first step is to launch it and I seriously can't with my simple hands do it alone. I need your help. Join me and let's save the planet. 

I want to assemble a team with various skills, expertise and talents. If you want to help and are conversant in the following field, please do contact me (via reddit private message):
