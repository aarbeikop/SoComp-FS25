If you are successful, lots of people will sell of fossil fuel stocks. That will depress their price, and allow others to scoop them up cheap and profit from them. The reason fossil fuel stocks are constant earners is because people still consume fossil fuels. You'll need to address the consumption side as well as the production side (your current proposal) if you want to succeed. 

It turns out that the consumption side is very hard to fix. Take your own post, for example. You mention ""renewables,"" but solar and wind in particular are intermittent. That means that power companies have to burn a lot of fossil fuels to fill in the gaps. So much so, that fossil fuel consumption was only reduced a little in areas with big solar deployment and actually **increased** in areas with lots of wind production: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518300983

I humbly suggest that nuclear power needs to become a large part of the solution. If your fund can buy into nuclear power companies, especially some of the many new nuclear start-ups, you'll be addressing the issue much better.

"e5hqs64","t3_9dg0ru","9dg0ru","climatechange","action-oriented","It's a curious financial adviser who announces a nebulous goal with no specifics, and then goes looking for investors. I would guess most people employ financial advisers specifically to filter out low-specificity scams like this one.

People who want to invest in renewable energy or sustainable products have some established options. It's usually high-risk because they're directly investing in the equity of not-well-established companies. But it's a growth area, and seeking appropriate risks to take in pursuit of growth can be an important part of portfolio construction.

I avoid these sectors myself because the volatility is too high for me — I'm not really a direct-equity investor all, at this stage. But if some companies in these sectors become established and get the volatility of their returns under control — at the level of hydrocarbon companies, who are masters at dealing with volatile revenues — then they'll be added to the portfolios of index and mutual funds which attract a huge amount of investment in the US and elsewhere.   

Risk-seekers can do what they want. But even the most risk-tolerant investor — one who is considering an investment of either money or time — has more transparent and promising options than this. It's worthwhile to find them. ","2018-09-06 13:17:37","2","DocHarford","1747798810.081995","climate protest","manual"

That includes species extinction, deforestation, ocean dead zones, pollution, Amazon rainforest destruction, and the release of CO2 and methane, not to mention that an Omni Diet uses a lot more land, water, energy, and food than any other diet. It takes about 16 pounds of grain to make one pound of beef. Animal agriculture is simply unsustainable. ","2018-09-06 13:15:04","5","SolarpunkArtist","1747798810.086327","climate protest","manual"

"e5i6m2q","t3_9dg0ru","9dg0ru","climatechange","action-oriented","Renewable energy alone cannot even come close to solving our issues. We need a large decrease in population, a redefinition of ""quality of life"", and a massive reduction in global disparity.

These things are not compatible with the economic system of ""growth"" that your are basing your proposition in. Who will invest when there is no personal return? If interest rates are always negative? If every quarter, the board must tell the shareholders ""yes, next quarter we predict another 3% decrease in value! Invest more please!""?

I like your energy and enthusiasm, and I hope it works out for you, but there is no solution in what you're proposing. ","2018-09-06 17:09:40","-1","InvisibleRegrets","1747798810.095525","climate protest","manual"
