Reducing emissions is costly in the short term. There is no financial incentive for companies to reduce emissions - why should they? Also, very few of us consumers are willing to pay significantly more for a product with reduced emissions.

In many cases it's even more direct than that. Most of the companies on that list are oil companies involved in production and distribution of oil products. That production and distribution emits very little CO2 as a percentage of the whole. It's when we as individuals put that oil in our cars and burn it that the emissions happen. It's just that the accounting for these things attributes those emissions to those oil companies for convenience (rather than having to name millions of individuals). Obviously those companies are distributing oil knowing that it will be burned so they're complicit, but the people who are directly emitting are... pretty much all of us.","2019-09-29 12:50:01","9","skeeezoid","1747870021.8199449","climate protest","manual"

"f1v9vg4","t3_dat0jl","dat0jl","climatechange","action-oriented","This is so complicated. My feelings on your first point about companies selling to us is that there are a combination of things to consider. 

1) government regulation could make a big difference here. Consumers want sustainable options but they also want to continue living their lives (i.e. getting to work on time which might mean driving). Government regulations that push companies to provide sustainable options, especially when those options are subsidized to offset consumer costs, could make a big difference. 

2) the top 10% of consumers are doing a lot of damage with things they legitimately don't need (i.e. private jets. One transatlantic flight produces a lot of emissions). When you think about which consumers should be changing their habits, we should point the finger at the top 10%, not at low and middle income people who are trying to get through their daily lives/take care of their kids/survive. 

3) governments themselves as consumers do damage too. Like military spending. 

I think if you are in the position to change your consumption habits then do so. But I also think government action has to happen because it's not possible to change global consumption habits without changing the greed mentality of producers who are selling it to us and that requires government regulations.","2019-09-29 14:47:45","2","pour_the_tea","1747870021.826859","climate protest","manual"
"f1wpvtz","t3_dat0jl","dat0jl","climatechange","action-oriented",">I am sure everyone has heard that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of CO2 emissions. The answer of the people I was talking with was that those companies only do that ""for us"", and I can see their point. In a free market, companies only produce what can be sold. So instead of blaming those companies, we should blame the people who buy their products and in doing so support companies that are destroying our planet. How would you guys respond to that?

Yes, individuals can make decisions, but these decisions are often influenced greatly by forces outside our own control. People who choose goods that come from sustainable sources often pay more than those who choose unsustainable sources. We might want to start asking, why do we have a system that financially rewards people for valuing short term the over the long term. Society doesn't have to be this way, but there's no way to fix this issue by focusing only on individuals.","2019-09-29 20:13:00","2","TheViewSucks","1747870021.829612","climate protest","manual"
