The world’s leading climate scientists have warned us that we have until 2030 to prevent temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius. That’s a little over twelve years - by environmental standards, the blink of an eye.

If we let the world’s temperature rise by a little over 2 degrees Celsius, the results will be catastrophic - sea levels will rise to untenable levels, heat waves will become far more common, freshwater will become even more scarce, and many more effects besides.

The time to act is now before it’s too late. According to the CDP’s Carbon Majors Report of 2017, 71% of the world’s global industrial greenhouse gases emissions come from just 100 companies. It is clear that the interests of big business no longer drive the prosperity of the human race. As a society, we need to change our course. 

For this reason, we will be organizing 3 global protests; 15th of January 2019, 27th April 2019 and the 1st of August 2019. All of that will be leading up the 27th of September where we will hold a global general strike, we need to make the world’s governments and the world’s businesses listen to the people, and the best way to do that is by refusing to participate in those businesses and governments. There will be no banking, no offices full of employees or schools full of children.
