It's decentralized, nonviolent and based on participatory democratic principles, with a strong focus on disrupting the system to bring about systemic change.  Join us :) (posting from Melbourne, Australia - better you join your local group though).They're much more developed at the moment in the UK, but groups outside the UK are growing fast.

Police walking around talking to the protesters, telling the media it's great.

Banker-types interviewed in the back seats of their cabs saying they've not been able to make it to their business meetings today, but that they support the protesters and if this is what it takes to do something about climate change then it has to happen.

A passer-by seeing some of the protesters struggling to build a bench, so he stops and builds it for them because he's a carpenter, and why not help them? It's important.

A construction worker, not working because nothing was delivered today.  Feels fine.

Another construction worker, says the world has been slowed down and he can take some time, and he's glad because those in charge will finally notice and maybe his kids can live.","2019-04-17 16:43:35","128","Spacecortez","1747803417.825862","climate protest","manual"

There's not a damn thing any government in the world can do to stop what's coming... the only thing they can do is prepare by going underground and developing Thorium reactors.  


Technology to clean air better, clean water better, recycle waste, growing food underground, making these tunnels water-proof and air-tight, figuring out some way to make them earthquake proof (9.8+ magnitude for hours) and keeping tunneling equipment handy to get out after it happens, both from shifting earth and potentially miles of water.","2019-04-17 22:51:23","0","SG_StrayKat","1747803417.857204","climate protest","manual"
