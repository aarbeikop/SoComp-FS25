"dc5ild","climatechange","action-oriented","How can I spend €1.000 or perhaps €10.000 in the most efficient way to help against climate change?","There are a lot of protests against larger entities and governments to request for action. However, to me it feels like the ""How dare you"" from Greta Thunberg is also directed to me. I, along with many other people here on Reddit, are in the position to make changes themselves. 
There are the obvious changes such as changes in diet, changing things in the house etc., but what could I do with let's say €1000 or €10000 to help curb climate change? 
I'm looking for something that can be done more than once. So not just switching a car, but something more scalable. 
Perhaps fund a marketing campaign for climate change awareness, support a local family in buying solar panels, invest in some upcoming technology through some source or another.
What way of spending this money will have the largest impact on climate change?","2019-10-02 04:44:51","49","36","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dc5ild/how_can_i_spend_1000_or_perhaps_10000_in_the_most/","True","Robdam","1747815667.585091","climate protest","manual"
"dkaw0r","sustainability","action-oriented","As far as recent climate change protests have gone","As far as I can tell the net effects of the [Global Climate Strike](https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/cyjavr/global_climate_strike_920_this_september_millions/) has been nil.  Is there any evidence to the contrary?

This is in line with the net effects of every published paper, international conference, passionate speech, documentary and online comment on doing something about climate change.

Emissions are set to rise short term and long term.  The threat intensifies, the risk for everyone increases and the scale of the disaster expands.  Anything contrary to the immediate phase out of fossil fuels is unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.","2019-10-19 22:39:07","5","2","0.86","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/dkaw0r/as_far_as_recent_climate_change_protests_have_gone/","True","--_-_o_-_--","1747816324.985377","climate protest","manual"
