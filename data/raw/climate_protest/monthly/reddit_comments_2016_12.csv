"dark3wv","t3_5gb9wg","5gb9wg","environment","emotional","No. Did 10s of millions of marchers stop the Iraq war? No. Did millions of marchers make a difference with OWS? No. This kind of marching wastes time and energy that could be used to apply pressure better in more effective ways. Record marches in Wisconsin stop killing unions there? Did marches in Michigan stop them from privatizing water and poisoning Flint with lead? No. 

It breaks my heart to see good movements expend tons of energy and resources on things that are not very effective.  Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this ""make noise and people will pay attention"" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to waste energy in the most inefficient manner. 

I wish people would realize that a protest does nothing by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: 

MLK: led marches and sit-ins that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT THEY COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. So these actions just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not just the noisemaking. 

Gandhi: his ""salt march"" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the marches.

Egypt: Successful: Leverage Point=Economic: Shut down commerce across the country
Notes: [""everything but the stock exchange and some other key commerce sectors were down""](http://www.techedon.com/2011/02/01/web/egypts-government-enacts-complete-internet-blackout/), large impact of [""$310 million a day, ... tourism could take a hit of up to $1.5 billion....in cities across Egypt banks locked their doors, factories stopped production and large numbers of workers vanished, further straining the economy. EgyptAir said Sunday that it had canceled three-quarters of its flights during the crisis, losing 80 percent of the revenue it expected to collect. ""](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/14/AR2011021405746.html) When Mubarak resigned he said (paraphrasing), ""I'm stepping down so that commerce can return to the area."" 

But today the public doesn't know what to do when faced with this challenge. They think that yelling in crowds makes a difference when all it does is get them put in some database. 

There are better alternatives. Take this guy who instead of holding a sign that was ignored, [buried a bad cop in paperwork](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/hostile-policing/Content?oid=17445843) and the evidence of this bad cop's activities [got him fired](http://www.king5.com/story/local/2014/09/02/13384714/). 

> Reply here to keep brainstorming. It feels good to at least be doing something.

It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, etc) which are effective.

"darq5dj","t3_5gb9wg","5gb9wg","environment","emotional","I LOVE your enthusiasm! I'm a recent activist as well. I could live with a Trump presidency if he switched only one of his political stances... climate change is real and it is caused by mankind and it must be stopped and reversed as soon as humanly possible. Nov 9 was a wake up call for this community stretching around the entire globe. His alleged racist and sexist principals, his belief in the USA being a Christian nation, his pro-big business doctrine and everything else I would ~~happily~~ grudgingly live with if he could just commit to protecting the planet.

Edit: We should invite Trump and his children to the March as well. I don't think they truly believe the nonsense preached by 1% of climate scientists around the world. We need to surround the president with people who love the earth and can convince him that it is in his best interest, both monetarily and politically, to switch his way of thinking. What better way to do this than have him front and center of the movement? He won't turn around overnight, but any gradual shift will be far better than the alternative.

Edit 2: Invite the republican house and senate too! This is NOT a single party issue and all of them need to wake up and commit to protecting their constituents in the short, medium, and long terms.","2016-12-04 11:45:25","2","GoldenRiddler","1747831392.709362","climate protest","manual"

But be aware — many major green orgs are still ""gradualist"" about climate action, and too timidly constrained by what they think of as ""political reality"" to actually advocate what climate scientists suggest is necessary to prevent catastrophic climate change. 

Just like Democrats epically failed in this election because they weren't adequately responding to the concerns of working Americans, enviro orgs are setting themselves up to fail because they aren't actually responding to the climate emergency.

More people should support groups like [The Climate Mobilization](http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/) that are advocating the WWII-scale national climate mobilization we actually need to get to net zero emissions and 100% clean energy rapidly.
