Regarding the university students near you, how do you know they didn't source the material from a dumpster? I somehow doubt they bought new boxes just to show their stance on environmentalism, but even if they did, the positive messages written on those signs could potentially have a negative carbon footprint. 

Instead of making little battles, we need to unite.","2019-11-22 12:04:41","24","maxis2bored","1747871949.88887","climate protest","manual"

Can someone show me a source that it takes ""dozens of gallons of oil"" to make what is likely to be a square meter or so of cardboard or similar?","2019-11-22 15:50:23","10","[deleted]","1747871949.892262","climate protest","manual"
"f8b48ma","t3_dzzm3g","dzzm3g","climatechange","action-oriented","You should put ""Strict Stance Against Paper Signs"" on a bumper sticker (a reusable bumper sticker, of course). I know it's possible to care about many things at once, but there are much bigger issues to be indignant about. The net benefit of forcing ideas like save the Amazon into the collective milieu seems like something to be celebrated. But fine, spend your time grinding your teeth with indignation while doing mental math.","2019-11-22 12:39:13","6","SlashYG9","1747871949.895561","climate protest","manual"

If the demand for that product hasn't been increased they haven't done anything wrong at all.


Did you ask or did you just assume?


We don't need everyone to do zero waste perfectly, we need everyone to do what they can. 

If everyone tries, we'll make huge progress. Talking down to people that are trying to make a difference isn't the answer.","2019-11-22 13:16:37","6","sh-rike","1747871949.897665","climate protest","manual"
"f8b67gn","t3_dzzm3g","dzzm3g","climatechange","action-oriented","You can use scrap paper to make signs. Even though I've tried to stop all junk mail, I STILL get some I can't seem to stop. But you can turn these into signs with a little effort, just cut off the identifying piece with name and address. Also hand-written flyers, while more time-consuming to make, may have a more personal grassroots appeal. You can flip over a sheet of paper and write a message on the back and stick it on a bulletin board, or cut up a used window envelope to make a small version, etc. You can save fruit stickers (by sticking them on a metal surface like your fridge) and use them to make a colorful mosaic sign.","2019-11-22 13:11:36","2","joez37","1747871949.900511","climate protest","manual"
"f8bppag","t3_dzzm3g","dzzm3g","climatechange","action-oriented","I've seen some really good protest signs made out of fabric before. We waste so much when it comes to textiles, that I love the idea of crafty people taking apart old pieces of clothing and sewing their message onto an old bed sheet, table cloth or curtain. Unlike a cardboard sign that inevitably gets crushed and bent at some point (no matter how well you try to hide/store it), you could actually wash your fabric sign at the end, and fold it away for later events. When you get to your protests, biggest, fabric banners can be held by multiple people, helping to show the solidarity we feel behind it :p

[This is a quilted example from scraps](http://www.quiltyhabit.com/2017/01/hear-our-voice-quilt-for-womens-march.html) with two sides and how she did it.

[Quilting for protest](https://hyperallergic.com/429923/quilt-con-2018-modern-quilt-guild/) is maybe one of the lesser known and underappreciated forms of protest. 

[These examples are tiny](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/329748003937906226/), so they didn't take much in the way of materials, and the letters were made from a small amount of thread, instead of inks or paint.

"f8cshlr","t3_dzzm3g","dzzm3g","climatechange","action-oriented","Its probably best to re-use however paper can be recycled and protests signs don't make a large contribution to waste.  After a protest it would be great if organisers collected signs for recycling so that nearby rubbish bins are not overly filled.

I do like the idea of making my protests signs from waste paper and cardboard.","2019-11-23 00:14:52","1","--_-_o_-_--","1747871949.905376","climate protest","manual"

At my uni campus, there was recently papers on every single wall saying ""why aren't we protesting about the climate??"". It didn't exactly help that there were some grammar errors as well, students started to write comments like ""maybe you should protest less and go to class more often""...

But yea, main point = less paper = more gooder.","2019-11-22 15:27:14","-1","Teledogkun","1747871949.908822","climate protest","manual"

The more people just shoot for Zero Waste as a lifestyle, the more this will get baked into the cake. For now, the point needs to be made, so thanks for posting it.","2019-11-22 13:03:33","-3","LudovicoSpecs","1747871949.910243","climate protest","manual"
