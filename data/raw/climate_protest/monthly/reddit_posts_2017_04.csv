Mann, Dr. Robert Bullard, and Ploy Achakulwisut. Ask us anything about the Peoples Climate March, climate science and why we march!","On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, people will come together from across the United States in the streets of Washington D.C. to resist attacks on people, communities and our planet. We invite you to join the Peoples Climate Movement on Saturday, April 29th as we march to:

  *   Advance solutions to the climate crisis that are rooted in racial, social and economic justice and committed to protecting front-line communities and workers.

  *   Protect our right to clean air, water, land, healthy communities and a world at peace.

  *   Immediately stop attacks on immigrants, communities of color, indigenous and tribal people and lands and workers.

  *   Ensure public funds and investments create good paying jobs that provide a family-sustaining wage and benefits and preserve workers’ rights, including the right to unionize.

  *   Fund investments in our communities, people and environment to transition to a new clean and renewable energy economy that works for all.

  *   Protect our basic rights to a free press, protest and free speech.


My name is Michael E. Mann. I use theoretical models and observational data to better understand Earth's climate system. I’m perhaps past known for the so-called “The Hockey Stick” curve that my co-authors and I published in the late 1990s, which has become iconic in the public discourse human-caused climate change. The Hockey Stick quickly became a central object of attack by those looking to discredit the case for concern over human-caused climate change.  As I describe in my book ‘The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars’, many of attacks have been directed at me personally, in the form of threats and intimidation efforts carried out by individuals, front groups, and politicians tied to fossil fuel interests. I use my personal story as a vehicle for exploring the role of skepticism in science, the uneasy relationship between science and politics, and the dangers of special economic interests to skew discourse over policy-relevant areas of science.


I’m Dr. Robert Bullard. Some often describe me as the father of environmental justice. I have written eighteen books that address climate justice, environmental racism, and regional equity among many things. I have testified as an expert witness and served as a technical advisor on hundreds of civil rights lawsuits and public hearings over the past three decades.


I’m Ploy Achakulwisut. I'm a PhD candidate in Atmospheric Science. My research focuses on improving our understanding of the interactions between climate change and atmospheric chemical composition, important for climate and human health. Currently, I'm investigating how future climate change will affect levels of airborne dust in the western US. I'm also interested in climate policy, communications, and activism. I was a SustainUS Youth Delegate to the 2014 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru. For the past four years, I've co-organized several campaigns to mobilize scientists to engage in climate advocacy.

**UPDATED (1:00pm ET):** That’s our time for today and so we’re signing off. Thanks everyone for the great questions. We really enjoyed them and we hope our answers were helpful. Keep the conversation going here and on Twitter and Facebook. We’ll see you at the march!

"66tz52","collapse","skeptical","Essay: Why a 'Climate Protest' on 'Earth Day' when Trump is cutting the budget for science in my opinion is 'Collapse Worthy'.","
Big business (Trump, et all... (from his billionaire buddies through to complete billionaire strangers)).......need to ignore climate change to ensure they don't loose millions, or even billions.

Much of what they're worth is in peoples perceptions of their businesses - in stocks and such.

As climate change and **collapse** become bigger concerns for a  larger number of people, that effects their worth negatively. Their business investment portfolios don't look as good long-term anymore. (beach-front property, oil investments, crop land investments)          
Add to this that their portfolios are already getting hammered by the current economic decline of several large world markets.

The billionaires HAVE TO deny collapse (in part climate change, and peak oil (which has been redefined a few times already)) to **protect their wealth**.     
            
Maybe a financial climate change blow to their wealth could have been taken ""on the jaw"" - **if the economy was doing well. It's not.** *So they take one of the only other options of denying climate change.*

Trump IS NOT STUPID when he deny's climate change. He's greedy. He wants his worth to remain.             
Cutting funding for research will help take the pressure off by reducing new collapse/climate change headlines.        
In fact, when he denied climate change, I believe some markets (DOW?) actually *rose*... as big business realised many of the regulations preventing them maximising profits would be going away. He knew that would happen. It's an easy one to work out. 

**Imagine how much angrier people would be if he didn't say ""It's a Chinese conspiracy!""**              

.... instead he told the truth.... ""I would lose a great deal of money to recognise climate change, so I WILL NOT!""

They'd march on his location and have his head on a spike.           
Instead they vent with ""BUFFOON!"" and shout louder in the hopes it makes sense to him eventually. **(It never will, because it's a sham ""ignorance"")**

Or a smaller scale lie: Imagine you and I worked together, and I kept ""forgetting"" to count up some stock in the evening, and everyone gets told off by the manager each morning.           
People would say ""Look SarahC, you've gotta try harder, here - add this  reminder to your phone. Put this post it note on your door! They'll all help you remember!""

Secretly I DO remember every night, I just DON'T CARE about making the team look bad. I feign stupidity, so people will keep trying to help  me understand, WHILE I DO NOTHING.

What if instead, I said ""Fuck you, it wasn't my job to do when I started. I'm NOT counting that stock!""

MAJOR rage. Suggestions of ""Cache you outside!"" for a beating.

See how ""ignorance"" panders to people's sense of care?

A telling truth - **Trump is taking steps to protect his lands from sea level rise.**

Actions speak louder than words?

Now scientists are MARCHING ON WASHINGTON!

I could almost laugh (or is it tears?) - **TRUMP GETS IT!** They wont do fuck all to change his beliefs, because he knows they're right right now!

He will never admit it, because it would wipe **billions from his, and people like him who have massive self-worth**.

Scientists think they can get him to listen to reason? Nope - EVERYONE should be marching, because he's a bloody money grabbing bastard.

Even if he isn't a sociopath (I don't think he is) - there's LOTS of ways for people to feel less guilty about being greedy and damaging.

""My charities help people!"" he'd think.              
""Climate change has fucked us all already - time to grab what I can  (financial wealth) before we go down.""                
... and one of the biggies: ""Scientists will work out carbon capture. It's a risk, but I'll be WAY ahead of the game (and American business, and my buddies too).""

That's the same way of thinking when you hate someone speeding ""The stupid jerk will kill someone!""

When **you're** speeding ""I'm late, this is important, AND I'm a careful driver."" (False attribution error)

People need to understand **Trump is delaying any climate action by acting stupid so people will waste time trying to educate the man, rather than bombing his golf courses, and digging out the foundations of his buildings.**

I DON'T believe scientists will make gigaton carbon capture, and I think we CAN slow changes down to save more peoples lives. Trump is one big business, we have to change them ALL The multi millionaires, the multi billionaires.

They wont do it, they are convinced they have the ""money to cope"".","2017-04-22 03:39:55","14","8","0.71","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/66tz52/essay_why_a_climate_protest_on_earth_day_when/","True","SarahC","1747836297.3666","climate protest","manual"
