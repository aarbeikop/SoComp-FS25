I've been feeling more and more powerless recently in the face of increasing apathy and active antipathy about combating climate change.

I'm trying to find or form a local group of people to think about what we can do to combat this and actually do something about it. Whether it be events, posters, websites, apps, radio interviews, talking to local businesses. The focus would be on trying to make local changes and focus on the positive changes we can bring about. Not protesting pipelines and stuff, that's already covered.

Does anyone know of any initiatives like this, in their local area? What do people call them? How did they form them?
