I’m petrified about everything that’s happening and I’ll continue to do what I can to help stop what’s to come. If this is possible if like to move somewhere that we’d be safer and still have the ability to help engage in climate change protests and be able to be active politically.

Hi everyone

So, after yesterday’s protest in the Swiss capital of Bern (it was amazing) I was eating dinner with some people who are rather critical towards FFF and of course we were talking about climate change, what could be done about it and so on. After a while some issues and questions came up that I couldn't answer, so I hope you can help me so I am prepared for next time.

1. I am sure everyone has heard that 100 companies are responsible for 71% of CO2 emissions. The answer of the      people I was talking with was that those companies only do that ""for us"", and I can see their point. In a free market, companies only produce what can be sold. So instead of blaming those companies, we should blame the people who buy their products and in doing so support companies that are destroying our planet. How would you guys respond to that?
2. Another figure I have heard is that as an individual, you can’t even reduce 2/3 of your CO2 emissions, no matter how much you try to. Is that true? And if so, why?

I'm looking forward to your answers :)","2019-09-29 09:30:44","46","17","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/dat0jl/100_companies_responsable_for_71_of_emissions/","True","SocialistDerpNerd","1747814930.581098","climate protest","manual"
"d9f3m5","sustainability","action-oriented","Tokyo's climate strike happened at 5pm, but at least it happened.","My friend and I happened to be in Tokyo during the climate strike and so we joined in theirs while we were there.  
It was pretty absurd at first because it happened at 5pm... Yes, a work/school strike that begins after work/school.

Once we got past the weirdness and joined in, it became immediately apparent that Japan didn't have a very large base of people that were particularly concerned about this. Of course, part of that might be the language/cultural barrier, which means they are more likely to organise their own protests than jump on the back of world protests, but I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. We were, after all, in a country where many things sold are triple-wrapped in plastic and then handed over in a plastic bag. Not to mention all the coffee shops we saw where all the customers were sitting indoors, drinking from disposable coffee cups.

Mind-you, as far as I'm aware, they do a good job with their CO2 emissions, so I'm probably focussing on the small issues. Also, I'm relatively new to understanding these issues, so I'm not the best person to pass judgement. Nevertheless, once it kicked off, a huge number of people joined in. It was by no means anywhere near the numbers seen in other countries around the world, but it certainly wasn't fruitless.

It was odd how we had to wait for traffic and it took a while for the politeness of the Japanese culture to wear off enough for the chants to get going, but once it did, the march was great! It gained quite a bit of attention and it turned out that we were marching through rush hour, going through one of the busiest crosswalks in Japan, in the city of Shibuya.

We made a video of our experience in the march here if you're interested to check it out:

It's super interesting to see the change in atmosphere when the march properly kicks into gear.","2019-09-26 05:09:28","116","7","0.99","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/d9f3m5/tokyos_climate_strike_happened_at_5pm_but_at/","True","GeekBite","1747815593.855593","climate protest","manual"
