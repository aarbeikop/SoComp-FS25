People are laying on the road and disrupting traffic, people on the side lines chanting and holding up signs. 
Theres tons of people, I talked to some holding a banner and they seem serious, and they know collapse is coming. 

I honestly got very emotional and teared up a few times because I wasn’t expecting to stumble upon people awake and aware and willing to get arrested in downtown NYC, in front of the court houses. It made me feel a small happiness. Thank you.","2019-04-17 14:31:36","1123","409","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/be8hkp/massive_climate_change_protest_in_nyc_right_now/","True","invenereveritas","1747803414.7971342","climate protest","manual"
