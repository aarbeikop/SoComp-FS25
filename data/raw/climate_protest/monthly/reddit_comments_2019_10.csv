If you’re smart with messaging and can recognise who to target then do it. €10,000 will get you a lot and can potentially influence a lot of people. 

Representatives campaign on what is popular. Change people’s minds, and you change a political candidate’s. They need the votes and will lay down policies that reflect what the people want (in theory).","2019-10-02 06:17:31","8","botfaceeater","1747815669.05343","climate protest","manual"

If you have time - organise regular fun/social/cooking events (no or least tech) - get people out of their A/C rooms, Laptops, Mobiles etc. Its fun for you and people, and together you guys will save on electricity - which indirectly translates to some CO2, or some waste released somewhere in the lifecycle of the device and/or the energy.

People are connected to (inorganic non-biodegradable) things, things that generated pollutants, things that run on electricity which is not clean somewhere.

"f4egkmd","t3_dkaw0r","dkaw0r","sustainability","action-oriented","I think it's true that there wasn't any immediate 'wins' like governments announcing policy changes but i work with a local climate action charity and there's a definite sense of a shifting tide in terms of government and corporate willingness to act on climate issues. The strike played a part in this and in my opinion did shift the position of climate into global conversation (i.e. my colleagues now talk about climate change at work and i rarely overheard any discussions on before). 

Don't get me wrong i wanted, and indeed expected, more from it (though it's still going on) but i think a lot of the action we need is always going to take time and shifts in government. This can't happen overnight, just keep the pressure up, keep doing what you can, inspire others and we'll get there (hopefully 😅).","2019-10-20 07:46:30","2","xCRAWx","1747816326.519317","climate protest","manual"
"f4cwbq1","t3_dkaw0r","dkaw0r","sustainability","action-oriented",">Anything contrary to the immediate phase out of fossil fuels is unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.

well, you certainly sound open-minded and optimistic. 

what about using fossil fuels to rebuild the grid and then attempt to reverse things? not even saying that is a good idea but you leave very little space open to discussion when you say anything contrary to my perspective is "" unproductive, irresponsible, inferior, immoral, unethical and anti-human.""

a big part of this discussion needs to be winning people over to a new way of thinking. without optimism that it can be done, what's the point? 

what about the people who see the threat but are pessimistic. why work today if the battle is unwinnable? 

I happen to think its totally winnable. we went to the moon after 60 years of flight. cured smallpox. travelled faster than sound. The shift to a green economy is nothing but the next great adventure.

so fight. try. do what you can. buy a tree. talk to people with an open-minded optimistic perspective. lower yourself to this one task and maybe the next hurdle will be easier. 

like will smith said: you don't build great wall by trying to build a wall. you just set one brick as perfectly as one brick can be set, then another and another and sooner or later you have a wall. 

so here is your challenge if you want to accept it, make everyone around you believe that it's winnable, that its worth fighting. that humanity is worth saving. convince everyone around you, maybe start with yourself?","2019-10-20 01:25:54","0","disciplinepadawan","1747816326.5254788","climate protest","manual"
