And still my parents got big gas guzzling vehicles because they were more comfortable in them and I think also because they thought if climate change was really a threat then we'd be doing something about it. 

And then there was a time around the late 90s where even smart conscious people thought that maybe climate change wasn't really happening or it wasn't going to be that bad. 

I moved to Chicago in the early 00s and rode my bike/public transit, didn't have a car was a vegetarian etc... But somewhere around 2014 I gave up and I started to have that thought in the back of my consciousness that - if it was really this bad we'd be doing more. It was at that same time that I was graduating with a degree in chemical engineering and started working in the medical device field. Still supporting climate change action, but just not on my mind so much...

Then I decided to actually read the IPCC's Oct 2018 report and study it... Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck! 

My fucking in-laws can't even eat a meal without bitching about paper straws how the fuck are we going to convince them that they can't eat a lb of beef with every fucking meal???

1. You need a close relationships with friends or family. 
2. You need a sense of contributing to the community. 
3. You need a connection with nature.

Buddhist monks, who give away all their possessions, are the happiest and strongest people I've ever met.  It's not about reliance on God.

In all seriousness, though, there’s no one “right” way to feel.

This is, emotionally speaking, completely unchartered territory. We may be aware of the five stages of grief, but, again, that was studied in terms of known situations; it wasn’t framed for the death and destruction of absolutely everything we hold dear.

This is kind of about how you are looking at it, and how you look at it is a choice; you could also choose to say: 

I know that the human race is coming to an end; I know that I have nothing left to lose because all is lost.

"eu96lyh","t3_cf7msp","cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","Hi. That is a great post. It is a very interesting perspective and I didn't realise what life was like in Poland. I live in the UK and I have met many Polish people and they are generally very nice. Lots of them send money home to their families and I wonder if that maybe has an effect on the complacently of people as some have money coming in.

As to you fears I would like to recommend a book. It is The Long Descent by John Michael Greer and if you approach it with an open mind it should help you process how to deal with some of your fears.

Also as to a suggestion. I suggest getting the fuck out of dodge and making a life work somewhere that is less at risk of these changes.","2019-07-19 21:48:16","1","Sarcastic_kitty","1747813627.885061","climate protest","manual"

"euacmch","t3_cf7msp","cf7msp","collapse","skeptical","They say that in the world there is both *yin and yang*. But it looks like the battle of ""good and evil"" is out of balance. Why else does negative usually win? Also human mind is so easily manipulated that we end up with vast majority of people (90% or whatever percentage you give it) following whatever current power or major trend we have. This enables ""negative"" power to rule.

Is it all unfair? Well, maybe. But then again it is what it is. Humans are who they are, as flawed as they are. In the end in nature there is no 'fairness' or 'unfairness'. There are just natural processes. Big animals eat small ones. If something is out of balance, it will be forced back to balance. Humanity has gone way out of balance, we will be forced to get out of this planet, so Earth can get back to balance. 

Nature doesn't give assessments of ""good"" and ""bad"". But it reacts if harm is done to it.","2019-07-20 08:29:57","1","202020212022","1747813627.897187","climate protest","manual"
