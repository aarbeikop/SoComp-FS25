Fall is in the air, and you know what that means... pumpkin spice lattes, degenerate movies marketed towards kids and holiday travel highlighting the sheer ineptitude of our collapsing infrastructure.

But all is well inside the bubble. Gas prices are up, wages are stagnant, war is unending, and the next bust cycle is set to begin... where those with reserved wealth can buy up all the crap that people lose for pennies on the dollar. Meanwhile, the plebs are bickering about how many genders there are. First worlders stopped having kids, so we can basically sunset all of our entitlement programs without anybody even realizing what has happened. Sure the old people will get upset... but we can always just pull the plug on them.

The average American can't afford to fix their own family car, spends so much time commuting and working they don't even have time to clean out their garage, let alone interact meaningfully with their families, and can't even buy vegetables that aren't covered in a chemical made by the same company that manufactured agent orange... yet believes unequivocally that LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER TM.

Phase one was a huge success. But alas these wells are running dry. Publicly we tell the people that there's so much oil reserves in the ground we don't even know what to do with it all, but you all know the reality... that is garbage oil. The public believes that renewable energy is the future... but as we all know the math simply doesn't add up. So phase one has run its course... the expansion of the economy and the extraction of material wealth from the Earth.

Now it's just a matter of downsizing this bitch. Cutting out all of the inefficiencies and taking back so many promises, we're bound to step on a few toes. After all we do live in a society. Phase two consists of massive population reduction, drastic diminishing of the standard of living and a slow-but-steady steady erosion of people's rights... until they're reduced to nuvo serfdom. Cities will be nothing more than Gardens, a place where you can go and see humans on display. Factories will produce everything, operated by workers who are barely capable of doing their job. The hardest part will be keeping people from having a little bit too much to think.

At least that was the plan... but Something Wicked This Way Comes. I see a Bad Moon Rising. Mother Earth, it seems, hasn't taken so kindly to being subdued. We could turn back to production now, but doing so would mean sacrificing everything we've worked for... and we are so close to an amoral Disneyland Utopia. Problems we thought we solved are rearing their ugly heads. Freakout mode doesn't even come close. This is full-blown hysteria.

We're shutting down free speech, because we don't know if it's the symptom or the disease. Paranoia has gripped the people. Hyper-vigilance and depression run rampant. A dark sense of unease grows like a cancer, and there is nothing but this horrible silence when politicians speak of a brighter tomorrow.

Nobody believes it anymore.

Not even the architects. Just silence. So the people stop buying and selling. Start hoarding and hiding. Start growing conspiratorial. The enemies they see them around every corner lurking behind every tree... and everyone balkanizes. People start growing certain that others are going to attack them... they start weighing the risks of attacking first. Syria is no more. Europe isn't far behind. America will hold out the longest... but even a city shining on the hill is subject to the corrupting influence of division within its own walls.

So we have nothing more than hopium and distractions, amidst a terrible and growing silence. A silence that threatens to consume us all.","2019-09-13 17:06:44","32","3","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/d3sawv/weekly_pirate_radio_opening_monologue/","True","Pentecost_Respecter","1747863957.7179909","Fridays for Future","manual"
