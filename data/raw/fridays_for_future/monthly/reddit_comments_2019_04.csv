Think about converting CO2 into rocks or some sort of gas to drive cars with. the problem has to do with implementing these options. it could take 10 years to have enough machines etc. to work with it. it’s way too late then. therefore we have to calm down now and later implement these options. 

also, this doesn’t solve things like the plastic problem. these are really our economic and careless way of thinking.","2019-04-18 12:52:06","4","brittavondibuurt","1747861562.7029262","Fridays for Future","manual"

While it is very important to invest in R&D for this technology, it is many decades away from being implemented on the gigaton scale. In the meantime, the most effective way to mitigate climate change is to rapidly decrease our emissions. 

The IPCC SR1.5 goes over a number of Carbon Capture methods, from BECCS to DAC, to biochar, to reforestation/afforestation, along with potential drawdown of each method and pros/cons. In the end, it suggests that all of these methods combined could help to drawdown ~ 18-25GT/year, if they're all implemented to the maximum feasible scale at maximum efficiency. Current global emissions are ~41GT/year, so we would need to meet that difference (and more, since we need *negative* emissions, not only neutral) with emissions reductions thru consumption reduction measures. This is a *best case scenario* and the IPCC (and many other groups) warn that depending on these highly theoretical, untested-at-scale options is not a smart choice.

We need to focus on emissions reductions starting immediately, and then hope that these technologies and methods can make up for whatever baseline level of emissions we would require to continue to keep our civilization running, in whatever form that would look like (very different from our current growth-based, GDP economy).","2019-04-18 18:55:53","3","InvisibleRegrets","1747861562.706655","Fridays for Future","manual"
