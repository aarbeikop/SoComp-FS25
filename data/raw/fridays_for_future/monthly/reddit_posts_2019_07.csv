[Ford](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=F) and [Volkswagen](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=VOW3-DE) plan to announce Friday new joint ventures on autonomous and electric vehicles, two technologies considered critical to the future of the auto industry.

The deal calls for “billions of dollars” in investments and will allow the companies to share both intellectual property and hardware, according to company executives with first-hand knowledge of the negotiations.

"c86ad3","collapse","skeptical","""We'll be fine, but our children will be fucked""","The quote in the title is a very prominent one, I've heard it the last time talking to a friend who thinks climate change will have a serious impact on us as a civilization, but it's so far in the future at least our generation basically won't have to worry about it personally affecting them. We are both millenials and live in a first world country in Europe. I still don't expect to be able to die of old age. Am I too pessimistic?

I think the majority of people are aware of climate change and agree that it will have negative consequences, however, I also believe that the vast majority of that part of the population is not in the slightest aware of just how bad and how fast everything can and propably will turn upside down. ""We live in such overabundance of consumerism where you can buy the most useless and luxurious goods and you expect me to believe we will have trouble finding food and water?"" (not an actual quote, but a likely thought process of those people).

People are worried that they won't be able to ski in the future, that the cute polar bears die out and that summers are going to be slightly more inconvenient for them and anything beyond that is just too abstract and too uncertain into the future doom and gloom scenarios. Friends I talk to scold me for making them feel bad when I suggest they should at least think about having kids because of climate change. Everyone expects to live a happy family life until they die of old age.

At least Gen-Z with their Fridays for Future movement are starting to be actually worried about their lifes (""I want you to panic"" - Greta Thunberg). Until they will be able to actively politically take action everything will be far too late. If even my generation doesn't care enough about climate change how should we expect Gen-X and Boomers to act?

Economic growth is still more important to politicians than the survival of our species. That's why they make compromises and try to retrofit our unsustainable consumerist lifestyle into a ""green future"" with wind turbines and solar panels. They can't accept that we maaybe have to stop consuming so much shit and leading such wasteful lifes - the wheels must be turning and always faster. Ben Shapiro makes fun of people like us and says shit like ""They want us to go back to the stone age."" and I'm just thinking even if that strawman was our only option to save us from 5°C+ warming it would still be far more preferable to what awaits us if we keep going.

Sorry for my rambling, this could be shorter and more coherent.","2019-07-02 07:30:31","134","75","0.98","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/c86ad3/well_be_fine_but_our_children_will_be_fucked/","True","mongopeter","1747863043.3634188","Fridays for Future","manual"
