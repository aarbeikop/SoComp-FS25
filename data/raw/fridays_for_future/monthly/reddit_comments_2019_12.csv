"f9vhjtf","t3_e75ena","e75ena","collapse","skeptical",">we possibly bounce back from the effects of emissions up to the 2020s?

I don't think so.  The science is against us.

I don't begrudge Greta and XR their moments of victory.  At least they are raising awareness, and maybe some people can prepare for a much harsher climate.  It's probably a healthier strategy than what I do, which is read gloomy story, after gloomy story, and occasionally comment.","2019-12-06 22:17:48","15","NoviSun","1747865514.018857","Fridays for Future","manual"

Since there's no middle ground, there's no good answer, at least not for anyone looking for a solution for humanity. I think we should stop, not because it will be good for us, but because it will end our contribution to the problems. Cold turkey, and let things fall where they may. That means no geoengineering either.","2019-12-06 23:03:23","9","Rhaedas","1747865514.022261","Fridays for Future","manual"
"f9vhdq1","t3_e75ena","e75ena","collapse","skeptical",">what extent could we *feasibly* save our collective asses by sharply curtailing/completely stopping our emission/consumption now?

If you're following Greta Thunberg, then you should know by now that we need to cut emission in half by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. This is, without a doubt, physically feasible. Its just a question of whether enough people are willing to make the  necessary sacrifices.","2019-12-06 22:15:52","8","Disaster_Capitalist","1747865514.024794","Fridays for Future","manual"
"f9vxp50","t3_e75ena","e75ena","collapse","skeptical","Yes, it's depressing but I've noticed that the majority of people who haven't accepted and/or don't realize how fucked we actually are *really* like to feel like they're doing something and want to see that there are some small victories to be found.

Following Greta and her output/reblogs helps them to feel a little less bad about things so they can still have some hope for their future.  It's irrelevant in the long-term of course, but at this point there isn't anything we could do to undo the damage that has been done since the industrial revolution (and most certainly the last 40 years which really sealed the deal) so I can't fault anyone for clinging to whatever shred of hope they can find.","2019-12-07 01:36:09","3","Grimalkin","1747865514.0270422","Fridays for Future","manual"
