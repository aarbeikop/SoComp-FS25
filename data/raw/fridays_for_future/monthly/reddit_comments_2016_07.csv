What do you think is the likelyhood that this is an unstable system (I guess a definition would be ""likely to eject the planet within X MA), you fill in X?

If it is stable, do you think that (ha ha OK) that there is the possibility that a system like this could support even basic life?

Finally, you said these may be ""not rare"" - Do you expect them to be common?

From that, they make a lot of educated guesses about the planet and its viability.

Following the quote above, I'm curious as to what you hope to discover, or specifically shed light on, throughout the process of this survey?

"d538qqj","t3_4rq4i4","4rq4i4","science","scientific","On another site, Kevin Wagner stated ""The planet orbits about a third of the way between [the two stars], which is very near to the line of stability"". The ratio of separations is indeed much closer than we see in multiplicity studies of transiting Hot Jupiters, where companion stars are rarely seen within 50 AU.

However, I'm not so sure at what distance current theories (of which there are a vast number) predict hot Jupiters forming - just outside the ice line at a few AU, or further out at a few tens of AU, perhaps approaching the 1/3rd value you have seen in the case of the closest companions. I am also unsure as to whether dynamical stability scales linearly with separation, with the 1/3rd value always being near the limit of stability. Do any of the authors have any comments about how the separations and dynamical evolution compare to more compact systems?","2016-07-07 19:37:52","2","Dannei","1747840752.4898639","Fridays for Future","manual"

"d53avvq","t3_4rq4i4","4rq4i4","science","scientific","I recall reading a few years back that imaging terrestrial exoplanets with sufficient detail to see surface features (i.e. landmasses, oceans) could be possible with a network of space telescopes on the order of JWST (both in size/power and orbital location for longer exposure times). That would most likely be cheaper per unit than a single telescope because R&D costs drastically exceed manufacturing/launch/operational costs (even including additional R&D and operational costs for software and personnel to manage multiple spacecraft). Additionally, it would have the benefit of built in redundancy.

Unfortunately I'm not able to find a source for this. A few questions:

* Did I imagine this or is imaging with this level of detail technologically feasible with networked space telescopes?

If it is feasible:

* How large of a network would be necessary to obtain sufficient resolution? (assuming individual telescopes with JWST resolution)
* Approximately what would be the maximum distance at which direct imaging of this type would be possible?
* What amount of separation would be necessary between individual telescopes?

Finally:

* In your opinions are there any advantages to a solution involving (relatively) smaller networked telescopes vs. a larger individual space telescope?","2016-07-07 20:19:55","2","[deleted]","1747840752.498484","Fridays for Future","manual"
