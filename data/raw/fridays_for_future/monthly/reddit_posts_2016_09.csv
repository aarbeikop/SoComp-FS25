I'm Co-Founder of Authorea - a budding collaboration and publishing platform for academics to write, share and discuss research and scholarly articles for free and in real time. Ask Me Anything!","Hello r/science! My name is Alberto Pepe; my co-founder, Nathan Jenkins and I created [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com) after we both grew disappointed by the slow, inefficient, and obsolete ways by which research papers are written and disseminated.

We believe:

- in breaking the cycle of the individual in academia and squashing the collective obsession with academic rankings; 
- that open science and open scholarship will positively shape the future of academic publishing and increase/accelerate the rate of scientific discovery; 
- in researchers retaining ownership of their work and in the public having forever access to research for free (even if an experiment 'failed'); 
- in the 'paper of the future'; whereby a static paper is no longer viewed as an acceptable form of submission, rather a digital-born format that allows the reader to access and interact with the most important elements of a researcher's work: the data and code.

I’ll be back at 1 pm EST (10 am PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!
