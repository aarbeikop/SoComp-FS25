My question would be what route would you guys believe would be best to take to fight air pollution, do you believe a solution would come from reduction and innovation of transportation of goods and lab grown meats or do you guys see the better solution would be in having huge oceanic plankton farms or giant city air filters or an ""Amazon sized forest"" in Africa that would clean up more pollution than is being produced.
