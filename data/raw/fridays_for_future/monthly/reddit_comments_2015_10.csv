Great informative paper! 
The paper says that the fires are equally likely in landfills irrespective of the LFGCS installation.  What are options that can be used to prevent or minimize these fires?  Can anaerobic bioreactor be a solution that simultaneously may accelerate the waste degradation?  In your landfill data analysis, have you seen any fire instances in an anaerobic bioreactor landfill?  
Also, if there are fires, that mean elevated temperatures.  Is there a way to extract that heat and covert in to energy. ","2015-10-23 16:49:58","2","ssr13","1747835031.336858","Fridays for Future","manual"

Thank you for the AMA.
