I've seen a couple of proposal like yours and I'm always left with a question. Currently there are just too many papers published, the only way to even know what's going on it's to use automatic algorithms that decide for you what titles might be relevant for you (i.e.: the Google thingy). Aren't proposals to make publishing much faster and reviewed afterwards by readersonly going to make things much, much worse?","2016-09-15 12:16:46","50","lucaxx85","1747842023.600132","Fridays for Future","manual"

I think what you're doing is great; I would love to see a shift in how academic literature is shared and I think we are long overdue for the modernization that has already been readily accepted in other fields.

Unfortunately, I find that these academic journals all appear to suffer from low impact factors currently. What would you say to a budding scientist--who's career depends upon publishing in ""high quality"" journals--that would encourage them to publish in your journal?

Elsevier and cie are extremely profitable because of the ridiculous subscriptions that universities and research centers pay for.

2. How would you measure the impact of a ""paper"" (or whatever that non-static publication would be called) without any ranking system?

We have run into some question here, because we use impact factor as an initial screen on submissions in /r/science.  We set a threshold of 1.5, which allows most science through, while stopping some of the worst quality journals.  We have had to do this because we frequently don't have mods available who are familiar enough with a specific sub discipline to determine if a journal is legitimate or fake. Is there a better way that we could apply a quick screen for legitimacy on journal articles, similar to how impact factor works?","2016-09-15 17:15:58","3","kerovon","1747842023.631136","Fridays for Future","manual"

The last major push to challenge the big publishers (primarily in social sciences) that I am familiar with was the Berkeley Electronic Press- they promised better, faster, cheaper, high standards, and a way to escape the profiteering of journals. Many of us gave our time as reviewers and submitted our articles there in a grand gesture to ""make it work"".  And then the creators sold the collection of 60 journals to De Gruyter, and I, for one, feel lied to.

Thank you for your work in supporting Open Access. 
I work within a foundation to change the current publication model, which is as you say ""slow, inefficient, and obsolete"". One of the biggest obstacles we face is the current mode of academic achievement and how publishing is woven into this process. 
Do you face this obstacle as well? What are ways institutions can incentivize Open Access publishing and taking alternative routes to publishing?
