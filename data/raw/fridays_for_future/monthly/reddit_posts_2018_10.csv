I'm French and part of the citizen for climate movement that started in France in September 8th. We walked everywhere in the country to show our opposition to capitalism over consumerism and the lobbies. We walked again everywhere in France and in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany the 13th of October! We are now making. Connections with other European countries and want this movement to become a global movement. We will walk again for green Friday on November 23rd and again the 8th of December during the cop-24! The 8th of December is called climate alarm and needs to become an enormous global Mobilisation of citizens, associations and any human being who doesn't want this system to kill us! 

We have a French Facebook group of 80k people https://www.facebook.com/groups/1630479090389945/ we also work on discord to organise actions against our politicians, governments, we are developing a citizen lobbying tool to campaign against the same guys. Here is the American mother group that we created https://www.facebook.com/groups/2262372540500089/ we need people in the US and anywhere else to create their city subgroups and make this an international citizen movement. We need a citizen revolution to make sure we can have a future and that future generations can too!
