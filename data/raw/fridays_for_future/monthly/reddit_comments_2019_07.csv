"esk9fh0","t3_c86ad3","c86ad3","collapse","skeptical","I'm a millennial and expect things to get bad soon. I used to think it would be in the next 20-30 years. With all the recent signs of climate crisis around us, I'm starting to think we're in the beginning stages of serious Western collapse now. Of course, climate-driven political breakdowns have already occurred in various warmer places, like Sudan, in the 20th century.

I just don't know whether we're talking 10-20 years or 2-3 before things get bad for Westen/Northern Europe and North America. I'm really worried about what's happening in India. It's tragic for those involved, and a scary sign that mass migration may soon be significantly affecting European countries. Looking at how the populations here reacted to the migrant crisis of 2015, I don't see that going well politically or socially (although personally I think we should do everything we can to help).","2019-07-02 08:28:48","50","imahippocampus","1747863046.034661","Fridays for Future","manual"
"eskcmrm","t3_c86ad3","c86ad3","collapse","skeptical","Honestly, as a Gen-Zer, this is something I genuinely worry about a lot. The way things're looking now by the time I've reached adulthood in a couple year's time, I'll have barely a decade or so to live the life that previous generations had access to before things truly begin to go down the drain, and even that will be in a world that's steadily worsening. Obviously I'm not expecting it all to happen right away (As many have pointed out here, collapse will likely be unsteady, uneven and unequal), but one way or another I'm likely to be one of the ones to bear witness to the slow decline of society over the course of my lifetime.

What a lovely future I have to look forward to.","2019-07-02 09:30:47","32","lordthistlewaiteofha","1747863046.036913","Fridays for Future","manual"

It's possible we'll hit some turning point that accelerates the issues many-fold, of course, but barring that the slide will take decades more in my opinion. 

Now, society itself may crash sooner separately from climate issues and the like, of course, after decades of rampant rape by the moneyed classes capitalism is completely fucked and foundering badly, but from climate alone I don't see massive issues happening in 50 years. 

But, as I said, perhaps it gets bad enough that human society collapses from the combined pressures - that's far less easy to predict.","2019-07-02 14:28:55","5","cr0ft","1747863046.0478048","Fridays for Future","manual"
