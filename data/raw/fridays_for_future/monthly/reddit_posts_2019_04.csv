I\`ve got a question to all of you. 

I mean, I always thought this was kind of clear. But while watching and listening to movements like 'Fridays for Future' im wondering if some people even think about other ways than forcing humanity to stop emiting any climatechange supporting gases.

Wouldn't it be much more efficient and usefull to do research on methods with the goal of converting global warming gases into usable substances, instead of just trying to reduce the emissions?

So, would you agree? And if yes, what scientific methods are already out there that could be usefull (Disregarding the fact that they might not be fully efficient and capable of converting enough gases in the right amount of time to have any kind of impact yet.) ?","2019-04-18 12:06:22","1","4","0.6","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/bekqrt/innovation_against_climatechange/","True","It3z4","1747861560.980472","Fridays for Future","manual"
