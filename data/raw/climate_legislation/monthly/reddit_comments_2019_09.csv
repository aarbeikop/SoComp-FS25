"f182e57","t3_d87hwb","d87hwb","collapse","skeptical","For every issue, mass confusion has to be thrown in. This ban is about trying to reduce the use of Petroleum Plastic. The first confuser/diffuser term that has been brought into this issue is for the press to start referring to Petroleum Plastic as Single Use Plastic. The only purpose is to protect Big Oil.  
  
California and Hawaii are banning styrofoam takeout boxes, and the replacement Organic Plastic versions are starting to show up. It is Petroleum Plastic that doesn't degrade for decades. Organic Plastic does start degrading with exposure to heat and moisture and will decompose in a land fill. The reason styrofoam was used was because it is a very good insulator and manufactured extremely cheaply. The Organic Plastic replacements are more costly, about 50 cents each in bulk versus pennies for styrofoam, but with volume economies, will come down in price.
