"82oju4","collapse","skeptical","Say hello to the TRUE horsemen of the apocalypse","The fact that nearly every US government institution whose purpose is to serve as a climate and ecological ""expert"" is now led by individuals that refute the very existence of climate change, is symbolic of just how screwed we truly are.  Although we in the collapse sub acknowledge the reality of climate change and poke fun at the ""the fantasies and hopium"" of those that insist we can mitigate these effects, I personally feel that it is still worth it to try and slow the change in climate as much as possible in ways that don't increase the damage to the ecosphere at the same time.  However, with men like these at the helm, the very existence of climate change is still not fully acknowledged, and is often just straight up refuted, by close to the entirety of the leadership of the Republican party.  

Let's repeat that; one of only 2 major parties in, arguably, the most powerful country in the world, is the only major political party in that world that actively denies the existence of man made climate change.  Not only denies its existence, but proactively takes action against the creation and implementation of any protocols, laws and treaties put in place to solve the issue.  These men (and women!) are the absolute worst of our species, uncaring of anyone or anything beyond their own desires and ambitions, all while abusing their power in ways that will help ensure the complete destruction of humanity and the Earth.  People so blind that they condemn their own children, grandchildren and all future generations to a planet that is either uninhabitable or habitable in only the harshest sense of the word.  If there's one bit of karma that I would like to see come true, it would be to witness the venom and disgust that these future generations will feel for their forbearers for allowing the ecosystem to be ravaged to such a degree.    



EDIT:  One thing has been repeatedly brought up is the fact that I only discussed Republicans, while making no mention of Democrats and their own failure to produce any legislation or action when it comes to actively fighting climate change.  The big differentiator between the 2 parties, to me, is the outright denial of the issue by Republicans, whereas Democrats acknowledge the problem, but have not put forth and serious solutions to it.  While this inaction by both sides makes them each culpable, it's the blatant disregard of the truth and the actions of those Republicans in serious environmental roles (Head of the EPA anyone?) to deny the existence of man made climate change that pushes them over the edge in terms of being the ""evil"" party.","2018-03-07 14:15:44","52","74","0.92","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/82oju4/say_hello_to_the_true_horsemen_of_the_apocalypse/","True","drwsgreatest","1747857736.480505","climate legislation","manual"
