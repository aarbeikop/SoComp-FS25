But no, banning straws isn't going to do much at all to stop Climate Change. 

Here in Europe most countries have enacted some sort of ban/restriction on plastic carrier bags (mostly used to bring home shopping). They can end up in the ocean as well. So it is a good thing.

But what you will often see is people responding to questions like ""what is your view on Climate Change?"" with ""Oh I have switched to hemp carrier bags"". And you will see PR from major supermarkets along the lines of ""Oh we support environmentalism by fully implementing carrier bag reduction"". Mind you they lobbied against it...

I am reminded of a recent release from our food waste reduction agency in the UK, where they stated basically, ""as consumer waste makes up 40% of the total, we have decided to concentrate our efforts on educating the public on how they can throw away less"". Why not the 60%? They are probably only 30 food production companies...

So the agency gets funding to run the campaign. The director gets an MBE. Perhaps the population reduces food waste to some degree, and in reality nothing much gets done.","2019-10-02 07:35:48","2","Togethernotapart","1747866720.6073291","climate legislation","manual"
