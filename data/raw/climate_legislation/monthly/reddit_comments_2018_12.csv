The only green revolution possible is an anti-tech revolution.  The wilderness and the natural world are not compatible with technological civilization.

## Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How (2016) by Theodore Kaczynski --required reading for all on this forum.

Chapter Two is titled, ""Why the Technological System Will Destroy Itself"" ....Should be self-explanatory.

“There are more than a few people who feel that society's rush toward a technological future will lead to disaster. This book presents some pointers for thinking in broad, strategic terms about getting society off that particular road. …The reader will get a lot out of it. This is very highly recommended.”

 —Midwest Book Review

""Kaczynski's second book, *Anti-Tech Revolution*, is a true milestone in thinking about technology.  It is a well-researched, well-written, and thoroughly-documented work dedicated to undermining the technological system before its worst consequences become reality. Nothing else like it exists. All those concerned with the future of humanity and the planet would do well to study it carefully.""

\-- Prof. David Skrbina, University of Michigan, Dearborn, USA

“Kaczynski understands what those of us more fully participating in the technological system are unable to fully appreciate: that technological society is beyond rational human control and will result in cataclysmic harm. What he presents is a sound moral argument with what should be eye-opening historical social illustrations that are, together, too numerous to refute.”

—Jai Galliott, Ph.D. School of Engineering and Information Technology, UNSW Canberra

""Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How is Kaczynski’s well-reasoned, cohesive composition about how revolutionary groups should approach our mercurial future….. I recommend that you read this compelling perspective on how we can frame our struggles in a technological society.""

No interaction with the government necessary. It can and only will be done on a case by case, person by person, maybe sometimes group by group basis. But shouting abstract ideas at people while not understanding the depth of your own contribution to the problem gets you nowhere. I would say get acquainted with farming skills and if you really wish to preserve or carry on some low energy technology maybe some science knowledge wouldn't be a bad place to start either.

Fight climate change by fighting against climate change.  Carbon has to be more expensive for people to stop using it naturally.

> Climate change will devastate agriculture, facilitating mass droughts in some regions, ocean acidification will negatively impact many crucial fisheries, and many other tendrils of climate change will be detrimental to our **global civilization**.

You're not thinking things through.  The problem with global climate change is that it's global.  The reason previous fixes against acid rain, overfishing, polluting rivers etc is because the source and the cause where both under the same government.  CO2 doesn't follow those rules, everyone has measured their emissions vs the damage they are going to cause and decided it's worth it.  The countries that will be most hurt are not the same countries that are releasing the emissions.

Even if your idea took root what would that look like?  Imagine France and USA both installed radical green governments.  How will we force our global solution on the rest of the world?  Yes the USA currently is consuming a lot of energy but if we place heavy restrictions on all our imports they will just get imported to somewhere else.  China, Brazil, Russia, and India are not willing to sacrifice their development so Europe and North America can live in their developed world without being affected by climate change.  The only answer would be war, we would have to force the rest of the world to comply and that's not going to be good.  First it's going to cause a lot of wasted CO2 as we are burning and rebuilding lots of stuff.  Second a world government is more easily controlled by companies and more able to engage in non-optimal solutions; like moving everyone to high ground.","2018-12-07 22:47:28","2","shinosonobe","1747862367.3944619","climate legislation","manual"
