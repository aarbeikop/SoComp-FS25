"brdau7","collapse","skeptical","""We like to see smoke...it means prosperity:"" A historical tidbit","I was reading Joel A. Tarr's ""The Metabolism of the Industrial City"" this morning, and came across this:

""The climate of opinion in Pittsburgh in the late 1930s, however, discouraged discussion of smoke control. A city dependent on heavy industry, Pittsburgh was badly scarred by the Depression; clear skies suggested closed factories and unemployed workers. In additions, many local businesses were related to the coal mining industry, which also suffered severely from the Depression. As a sign of its belief that smoke equalled prosperity and its relief at the return of full employment, in 1939 the Pittsburgh City Council actually eliminated the Bureau of Smoke Regulation. ""You'll never get elected again,"" said one politician to a member of the City Council who supported antismoke legislation. ""We like to see smoke,"" added another politician; ""it means prosperity."" Many working-class people held opinions such as these - although they found smoke a nuisance and an annoyance, they were concerned that smoke control would cost them jobs. Pittsburgh, therefore, appeared an unlikely environment for the passage of substantive legislation controlling smoke emissions from either industries or homes.""

It's eerie how much staying power this rhetoric has - I have family who work in the oil sands in Northern Alberta, who are staunchly behind the continuing destruction of clean air and water for a quick buck, and can't understand neighboring BC's opposition to expansion of pipelines to tidewater. ""It means a fair shake for the Canadian market, blah blah blah.""  Pollution does not equal prosperity. Progress can only be measured in the rubble that is our natural world. We are hurtling toward extinction, and the very same twisted, self-centered, myopic worldview that animated the workers and councilmen of Pittsburgh in the late 30s still animates and structures civil society and economy today. We are so doomed.
