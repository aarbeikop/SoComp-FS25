"bw53z9","collapse","skeptical","Do those Rich who are aware think they can survive the collapse?","We know that certain portions of the influential were well aware of the effects of climate change ahead of official news, such as ExxonMobil. Yet they deliberately funded climate denial in order to prevent panicked legislation that would damage their profits. Likely as well, I assume, to get ahead of the game and start research into how to take advantage of new resources and trade routes, such as the Artic and deep sea oil, as well as set up early investments into 'renewable' tech to take advantage of the naive and prop up fossil fuels.

With that said, do these people genuinely think they can survive the collapse, such as the Silicon Valley folk who invested in New Zealand bunkers? Do they think the collapse won't be complete and that they'll simply rule over a shittier earth with more advanced tech, with delusions of trans humanism? Or are they honestly willing to just party til the end and fuck humanity?

I know good portions of them are probably just as deluded, religiously or in simple denial, as the common person, but of the intelligent and aware ones, what is their endgame, you think?","2019-06-03 01:46:00","39","38","0.93","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bw53z9/do_those_rich_who_are_aware_think_they_can/","True","NihilBlue","1747864841.193952","climate legislation","manual"
