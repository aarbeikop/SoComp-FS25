Democrats know they'll get destroyed in the polls, or worse, if they push the kind of regulation needed to put a serious dent in carbon emissions.  Anything that's not controlled opposition will get them swiftly kicked to the curb by their corporate masters.","2018-09-19 02:12:17","25","SoraTheEvil","1747861184.4689631","climate legislation","manual"

I think they wanted and like him as president so he can fuck shit up, strip rights away and they can have someone to blame because they wont do it. Then when his term(s) are over they'll run for office and using anti Trump as their talking point, get elected and then sweep Trump's bullshit under the rug and pretend it never happened.","2018-09-19 13:13:33","4","TheseNthose","1747861184.477664","climate legislation","manual"

How much meaningful change we'll experience is not set in stone. Personally I see a lot of good signs that we are slowly starting to change course. Look at California's new green plan.

This article looks at a lot of the people running with legitimate plans to decarbonize our society in the November election.

Many of them have really good chances of getting into office. A movement is started.

Whether it will be enough or not, is not known. No one knows exactly how much of this or that we need to change to get a specific outcome. To say we are all doomed is speculation, maybe we are doomed, but no one knows. We'll surely be less likely to be doomed if we start transforming our energy grid towards renewable systems.","2018-09-19 19:41:18","1","Montaigne314","1747861184.48129","climate legislation","manual"
