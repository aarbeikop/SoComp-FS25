I'm probably gonna be put on a watchlist, but fuck it. I don't want a CIA internship anyway.

After being on this sub for quite some time, I have lost my hopium-fuelled naivety. I no longer believe we can save the planet through progressive reforms. Most legislation like carbon taxes, tax deductions, and regulations can have an impact, but it all seems to be too little, and too late. Climate change will devastate agriculture, facilitating mass droughts in some regions, ocean acidification will negatively impact many crucial fisheries, and many other tendrils of climate change will be detrimental to our global civilization. We have to act now and immediately protest for radical reform. The yellow shirts in France have shown that protests can still work, with the recent regressive taxes on petrol in France being removed. If we strike and march against the elites and crony capitalists that are damning our species and threatening the entire biosphere we **can** win. It won't be pretty and many will likely die, but If we don't mobilize soon, we are damning ourselves. Vive la république and the democratic ideals she stands upon; rise up and let the heads roll friends. Anything short is death for the future generations.

# 18 U.S. Code § 2385 - Advocating overthrow of Government

\-This post **does not** advocate the overthrow of the government of the Republic of the United States of America, instead, it is actively calling for protests/demonstrations against the heaviest polluting corporations.

\-Any threat of violence is purely symbolic in nature.","2018-12-07 05:23:40","36","37","0.78","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/a3wtid/green_revolution/","True","gmoney8478","1747862365.747226","climate legislation","manual"
