I honestly think this is a good thing. We waste so much time and effort keeping people alive for a few more weeks just because. My dad is a doctor and once had a patient who the kids wanted to keep alive until he reached his birthday because the guy said he always wanted to live until 100. Meanwhile, the guy is brain dead and hooked up to a ventilator waiting 12 days until his birthday, taking up a hospital bed and wasting everyone's time. They can do that because of his health coverage. Ridiculous. 

Everything else is spot on, especially the popularizing of regression. Backyard chickens anyone?","2015-10-18 14:48:48","13","[deleted]","1747840308.519973","climate legislation","manual"

> What you expect: Most people in the city start to die, the rich flee to their wilderness retreats, others people build their own communities where they grow their own food and get their own electricity.

>What happens: Wearing second hand clothing becomes trendy among the young, as do bicycles. Supermarkets stop throwing away food. People have fewer children. Paid jobs are replaced by volunteer jobs. People are asked to patrol their own neighborhoods, the unemployed are asked to take grandma for a walk. Euthanasia becomes accepted, doctors stop trying to treat every health condition.

Absolutely. Bikes are the future and people are buying in.","2015-10-18 04:02:22","13","RowdyRoddyPiper","1747840308.522371","climate legislation","manual"

"cw40igt","t3_3p6nt9","3p6nt9","collapse","skeptical","The other thing we are missing is the synergy. The population increase will put stress on physical and social systems. The climate change will lead to war, migration, social stress and social breakdown. Coral bleaching, overfishing, runoff, and pollution will lead to a decrease in fish, the main source of protein for many poorer segments around 2050~2100. Global warming will lead to more crop failure, which will lead to more deaths. Deforestation will speed climate change which kill the Northern Forests which will again speed species loss. Soil loss will make big agriculture and increasingly non-productive activity from around 2050. These many factors will come together in complex ways to lead to collapse in individual's lives and in nations.","2015-10-18 15:19:31","3","newharddrive","1747840308.536792","climate legislation","manual"

It is about 45 degrees outside, and landlords are required by law to provide heat when the temperature outside is below 55 degrees. They save money by waiting until it gets unbearably cold (November-ish). I do not know how it used to be in decades prior to this one. Complaining to the city does nothing, and all the residents have solemnly accepted that this is just one of those things we have to live with.","2015-10-19 15:51:09","2","SeaHarp","1747840308.5496662","climate legislation","manual"
