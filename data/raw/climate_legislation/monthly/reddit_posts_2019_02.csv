"arohha","collapse","skeptical","[CONTRARIAN] real Earth, climate and humanity rescue plan has entered US Congress now. You must support it. I mean Everyone of you.","Incredibly simple to levy hence impossible to escape from by high emitters, rewards low emitters, does not foster bureaucracy, pushes other countries to legislate same schemes, easy to understand for anyone, digestible for wide public cause it means ca$h when doing righ things, blessed by the real guru James Hansen who was waiting for it for a very long time.

We should have had it 50 years ago.

Corporate press will keep their mouths shut about it cause this bill shatters most if not all corporate business models.

Support it, spread the word, let everyone and then some more people know. This is our real chance! Rise rise!
