"dvblsmx","t3_82oju4","82oju4","collapse","skeptical","My biggest problems with /r/conspiracy and /r/collapse are their collective inability to treat actions by republicans as the predominant overt evil we face, at the least in the short term. 

The chief conspiracy we face is the oligarchy deciding to get profit out of the resources they own by ignoring negative externalities.

They know that the real market value of oil couldn’t sustain the civilization that they have come to enjoy and they know that self-defense is warranted on a societal level. (In other words, if we had class consciousness, they’d all already be in prison.)

Do democrats have problems? Are they often neoliberal apologists? Yes. Are they more likely to try to steer away from ending the world? Yup.

SO SUCK IT UP. Take five minutes out of your day and vote the current suckers out come election time, then go back to whatever you’ve convinced yourself is a more productive way forward.","2018-03-07 14:49:34","23","unampho","1747857740.065877","climate legislation","manual"

"dvd2vsc","t3_82oju4","82oju4","collapse","skeptical","The way I see it the ruling elites have gone to great lengths over the decades to convince the American public that there are two major political parties.  There aren't.  

Virtually everything that is broadcast by all of the print and electronic media is either lies or misinformation or disinformation.  

What we have is a global plutocratic oligarchy.  All of these Democrats and Republicans are nothing but relatively low level errand boys.  

All that surrounds you, invades you, possesses you, and controls you is scripted theater.  You have absolutely zero power or ability to affect or to influence any significant aspect of the Universe.

I don't know why so many folks hereabouts have picked climate change as their preferred collapse boogie man.  The population dynamics of any species that overshoots its natural carrying capacity are thought, it seems,  to be fairly well understood by a significant portion of the population.  It is probably reasonable to conclude that the human species is going to experience a serious dieoff, but I doubt that there is one in hundred folks around that could predict the immediate causes that will precipitate that event.

Regarding your ""truth"", I find the world to be full to capacity of people, all of whom, apparently, who have been individually ordained as the purveyor of truth.  The place is virtually itchy, grimy full of the attitude, ""all those people are dirty rotten assholes because they don't subscribe to what I know is the truth.""  It's everywhere, pervasive, and to me, sick.

That's part of my story which is always open to rewrite.  I could be wrong.
