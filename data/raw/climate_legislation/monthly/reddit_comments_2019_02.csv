* Reward ""good"" behavior.
* Punish ""bad"" behavior.
* Repeat until behavior is modified.

Beautiful and elegant in its simplicity. Devilishly complex and counter-intuitive putting it into practice.

Less carbon being burned means less energy for the economy.

That means contracting the economy.

In our current system all the economy has to do is stall, never mind contract, to create a major economic crisis.

A major economic crisis means there is a lot less to go around.

And no, I'm afraid ""carbon dividends"" which reward large families (!) isn't going to make a bit of difference to people that have no jobs, no cars, and no homes.

In that situation people will be highly motivated to provide for themselves and their immediate families.

It is no secret that desperate people will do desperate things, and things are about to get pretty desperate indeed.

If I could pass (and enforce) the perfect ""zero carbon"" law?

&#x200B;

**Reward people (with life) who:**

* Refuse to engage in any activity that was made possible by burning carbon, in any form. Even if it means dying of hunger, thirst, and disease.

**Punish people (with death) who:**

* Do not swear to the above.

&#x200B;

Really doesn't get much simpler or more elegant than that.

Now, the only problem is enforcing it...","2019-02-17 21:32:57","18","[deleted]","1747863148.9398808","climate legislation","manual"

Post it on social media, and then rehash again after some time. Post it on other subreddits. Send a friendly notice to coworkers, discuss it with them in the office or workshop kitchen, tell any group you regularly attend about it. Sheer brilliance and impact of *carbon fee and dividend* is contagious and will help the case.

Imagine the world without suvs and pickup trucks, without oversized houses, frequent flyers, status consumption, without relentless waste of energy and endless waste, instead with modesty and environmental conscience finally rewarded.

"egpwcme","t3_arohha","arohha","collapse","skeptical","The usual reminder:

If whatever plan for ""saving the world"" you are pushing does not have as its two most essential and prominent components the following two things:

1. Reduction of global population by an order of magnitude by the end of the century

2. Immediate transition to a steady-state economy

Then you are a bullshitter (due to some combination of being an ignorant idiot and/or a deliberate liar) because those are the two absolutely necessary conditions for resolving the sustainability crisis. ","2019-02-18 08:51:12","4","gkm64","1747863148.947665","climate legislation","manual"

To do that, we have to transcend competition itself and completely retool our society. And we will probably not even be able to get the US behind this tiny gesture of a legislation.

"egoudds","t3_arohha","arohha","collapse","skeptical","The industrialised world is already doomed. Genetic and cultural degeneration destroyed any chance for this species survival millenia ago. 

Just like how in lions the elite males establish harems and kill all other males while living like parasites, humans too inherited sociopathy. Brutal warlord Genghis Khan had a voracious sexual appetite and went on rape expeditions, impregnating thousands of females. He now has millions of descendants. The mongol hordes raped their way through Asia and destroyed any hope the islamic countries had at enlightenment.
Just the same it is known that when agriculture was established there was at one point a time where a single male would breed with 20 females. Without doubt these males were the most aggressive and most sociopathic of their time. 
For millennia and countless generations the wealthy sociopaths have bred their sociopathy and addiction to growth, their urge to dominate and desire for violence into the human gene line.

The moroccan king sired children with hundreds of females, resulting in thousands of rape offspring. Just like how the kings had dozens and dozens of concubines and the aristocrats many mistresses, the sociopathic genes spread through the population.

It is believed now that most Brits now descend from the wealthiest and most powerful individuals of the middle ages. 

The communist hordes and peasantry, having women the 2nd world war, raped their way through Europe with no restraint; no woman was spared. Even their own women were brutally raped. Ambassadors of neutral countries were dragged out of the embassies and gang raped by the testosterone fueled primates.

It's no coincidence that so much evil has happened in our history. It's in the species.

No action to mitigate climate change will be taken. As Chomsky said there will be a genocide and an expansion of chattel slavery.","2019-02-17 22:37:39","-4","Serial_de_Killeur","1747863148.9540539","climate legislation","manual"
