You could stop on your trip in the Mr. Fusion powered Delorean and video the people panicking and being covered in ash, and when the people then saw their own faces on the screen, this would be pretty convincing.

In reality of course, there are no time traveling machines, and there is no way to convince people of what will happen to them sometime in the future.  So whether they smoke or live on the beach or near a volcano, they just tend to hope for the best.  Not all smokers die young, I had an uncle who lived into his 90s smoking two packs of Camel Straights a day.  Many people live on the beach for their entire lives without too much problem.  I live near a volcano (Mt. Redoubt), but so far it hasn't really gone ballistic.

There really is nowhere to live completely free of all risk.  You have tornadoes and earthquakes that can hit too.  So you pick a spot and hope for the best.","2017-01-13 16:40:39","7","ReverseEngineer77","1747849404.394381","climate legislation","manual"

That aside, I don't think anyone would have listened, and chances are you would have been accused as some kind of xtian (a catch-all term for all heretics by then) and fed to lions.","2017-01-13 23:12:35","1","kulmthestatusquo","1747849404.4031239","climate legislation","manual"
