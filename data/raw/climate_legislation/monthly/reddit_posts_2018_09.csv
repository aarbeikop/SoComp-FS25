"9gzgj0","collapse","skeptical","Reminder: USA will not reform climate policy past 2020. Even without trump","The liberal media and body politic  is ecstatic that it seems the public is turning away from trump, at least enough to get him out of there. The non doomers on climate are hyping this hard as if it can be stopped if we would just get donald out of the White House and a new Democrat in 2020 

None of this fundamentally matters for prospects for serious federal climate action. The obama era policy was to issue executive orders on various environmental issues but it barely put a dent in emissions. The republicans will have enough senators after 2020 to filibuster any legislative climate reform. My best estimate is they get somewhere from 50-54 in 2018 and the amount of seats they have that are vulnerable in 2020 is not numerous. I can see maybe five seats top that they could lose 

For those who don’t know what a filibuster is, it’s basically a way to cuck a reform even though you are deep in the minority.

I was doing some laughing recently at a quote where someone was talking to climate ministers I believe in India and they said “the world doesn’t revolve around the US” when they were referring to what trump was doing. This is so laughable. The country is one fifth of world emissions and much higher if you count the industrial activities in other countries that go into supporting Americans consumption and lifestyle. 

No federal reform in USA within sight until probably at least 2022 or 2024","2018-09-18 22:27:07","163","83","0.9","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9gzgj0/reminder_usa_will_not_reform_climate_policy_past/","True","FloridaIsDoomed","1747861181.897145","climate legislation","manual"
