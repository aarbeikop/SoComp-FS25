This thread is about the effects climate change has had on my area of the globe. I live in Northern California in a small conservative town called Red Bluff. This location has been having severely dry years lately and has been lacking in rain for years. It's Fall yet there has only been one or two rainy days so far. The Fall and Winter seasons have been really dry and hot lately and it's causing damaged soil, crops, and wild fires(as a matter of fact the recent fires have sadly broken records in damage dealt and intensity for the area.) It's October 21st and yet it's soo hot and dry that I have to have the air conditioner on and I'm seriously praying for rain AT LEAST a minor sprinkle spell! I'm really concerned about climate change and the heat and dryness that it is causing and it's giving me intense seasonal effective depression. How can people deny the existence of climate change when this type of unusual weather patterns are occurring across the globe? I really wish the energy grid would be converted to solar, wind, and geothermal etc across the world. I'm sick and tired of humans damaging the environment.. legislation really needs to do something about this.

Sorry I just wanted to kind of rant as this issue has been really bothering me.. I'm a girl that loves rainy grey weather and constantly being bombarded with fires, dryness, and heat is depressing.","2018-10-21 22:38:23","4","7","0.7","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/9q7w1s/hot_fall_weather/","True","TerraBranfordFFVI","1747861334.0418859","climate legislation","manual"

As a 30 year old for context, I see peers stress about their retirements or their kids college funds 15 years out from today. I see the more progressive folks worried about the environment and climate change in the sense that it actually has a chance of being salvaged. I do not share these concerns (not having kids helps too).

Coming to terms with the ideas not only are the higher ups responsible for anti-environmental business practices and legislation, but the common folks who aren't willing to reduce consumption let alone entertain the idea of degrowth; is liberating.

It is this resignation, that things aren't going to be alight, has given me a true sense of appreciation of what we have and enjoyment in daily sense. Who knows how this will play out, be it a long or short descent, but not having these worries has given me a new outlook on life, and it has impacted my spirit for the better.

Until then, I will go through the motions, do as society has prescribed for me, but I will do so and be appreciative for all we have for the time being.

"9rcljp","collapse","skeptical","Literature on Overpopulation, Immigration, and Ethics","A lot of the discussion surrounding overpopulation inevitably leans towards immigrants, developing nations/third-world countries, and whether those immigrants are to blame.

First, as an issue of source-knowledge, we should be skeptical of the green anti-immigrants and anti-population folks such as Tanton, Hardin, and Ehrlich. They were kicked out of the Sierra Club for a reason, and it's not ""political correctness."" These people just cook the facts. This is from Ian Angus and Simon Butler, the editor of *Climate and Capitalism* and co-editor of *Green Left Weekly* ( [https://books.google.com/books?id=DFxW8qWimskC&source=gbs\_navlinks\_s](https://books.google.com/books?id=DFxW8qWimskC&source=gbs_navlinks_s))

Tanton chaired the Sierra Club’s Population Committee in the early 1970s and was president of Zero Population Growth (ZPG) from 1975 to 1977. After ZPG refused to endorse his proposal for an anti-immigration campaign, he founded FAIR in 1978; the founding directors included Garrett Hardin and Paul Ehrlich. Since then he has initiated and funded many other anti-immigration groups, each designed to appeal to a specific audience, each presented as independent of the others.

It’s tempting to dismiss Tanton and his associates as marginal cranks, but their influence is significant and growing. FAIR, which focuses on lobbying federal and state governments, claims to have been invited to testify before congressional committees more often than any other organization, and in association with NumbersUSA it has successfully used mass lobbying to derail legislative proposals to give legal status to undocumented workers.

FAIR’s legal affiliate, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), assisted in drafting SB1070, the anti-immigrant law approved in Arizona in 2010. FAIR president Dan Stein describes SB1070 as “a law that both represents the interests of legal Arizonians and serves as model legislation for other states.”21 Elected politicians in fortyone states are members of FAIR’s legislative arm, State Legislators for Legal Immigration (SLLI); in May 2010 it was reported that SLLI-affiliated politicians had proposed Arizona-style laws in at least seven other states. 22

CIS provides intellectual ammunition for the anti-immigration movement. Although it claims to conduct “independent, non-partisan” research, it has, as Mark Potok comments, “never found any aspect of immigration that it liked.”23

A frequently cited CIS research paper attempts to assign hard numbers to the argument that by coming to the United States immigrants increase global greenhouse gas emissions. The authors claim:

If the current stock of immigrants in the United States had stayed in their countries of origin rather than migrating to the United States, their estimated annual CO2 emissions would have been only 155 metric tons, assuming these immigrants had the average level of CO2 emissions for a person living in their home countries.This is 482 million tons less than the estimated 637 tons they will produce in the United States.This 482 million ton increase represents the impact of immigration on global emissions. It is equal to approximately 5 percent of the increase in annual world-wide CO2 emissions since 1980. 24

They reach those conclusions despite their admission that “one obstacle to estimating annual immigrant and native-born per capita CO2 emission rates is that there are no data that disaggregate rates of these two population cohorts.”25 In place of real numbers, they use their own estimates, which they base on per capita income figures that are themselves estimates.

NumbersUSA, the populist voice of the Tanton network, blames immigration for unemployment, low wages, urban sprawl, congestion, overcrowded schools, lost open spaces, and more. Its president, Roy Beck, says such problems are caused by “bad recent public policies that raised the volume of national immigration above social, economic, educational, cultural, and environmental thresholds.”26

There's one more piece of evidence to hammer that idea home. It's NOT that discussions about sustainability SHOULDN'T include overpopulation, but it should reject oversimplified narratives of immigration, moral hazard, third-world countries, etc. Jenny Levinson writes this ( r/http://imagine2050.newcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/ATB_shortreport.pdf )

There should be no taboo on discussing population — a topic clearly tied to environmental concerns, as in fact is every human interaction within ecological systems. What should be rejected are racism and simplistic arguments that over-emphasize the “numbers game” at the expense of other factors — interlocking issues of production and consumption, patterns of land use, technology and planning, globalization and poverty, the status of women in society, as well as wasteful cycles of boom and bust. This remains true no matter how much ecological damage we believe societies may have produced. Such a social and ecological outlook is vitally important in overcoming “man versus nature” thinking.

Environmentalists who believe in holistic diversity need to be on guard — not just regarding Apply The Brakes, but also regarding other anti-immigrant groups using similar rhetoric. Groups with misleading or seemingly transparent names like Progressives for Immigration Reform, Negative Population Growth, and NumbersUSA — as well as others in Tanton’s network of anti-immigrant organizations — all seek to inject bigotry into environmental and population issues.

As a capital-T-Truth issue, bringing in more immigrants is actually net-better for the environment, and certainly not as bad as domestic migration/domestic population growth. Carmel Price, a post-doctoral fellow at Furman, does an analysis of multiple studies ( r/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-011-9216-3#Sec11 )  

These findings hold noteworthy implications for competing theoretical arguments about the environmental impact of immigration. Our results conflict with arguments drawn from population pressure and social disorganization positions, which suggest that immigration contributes to environmental harm by increasing population pressures on local ecosystems and by destabilizing communities in ways that inhibit collective action for addressing social problems like pollution. Rather, the null effects of immigration on air pollution observed here are more consistent with the ecological footprint and community resource positions, which suggest that immigration may not be harmful to (and may even be supportive of) local environments and communities. As the ecological footprint perspective suggests and as illustrated here, the different forms of population growth are likely to have complex and possibly quite different impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Based on this position, it is not altogether surprising that population growth from immigration appears to be less taxing on the environment than domestic migration and natural population growth, perhaps due to differences in lifestyles of the foreign- and U.S.-born or the potential stabilizing effects of immigration. ...

In addition, our results provide key political implications for law makers and social scientists interested in the social consequences of contemporary immigration flows and whether these demographic shifts are harmful to local communities. In terms of air pollution, our study clearly suggests that immigrants, at least in the short run, are not contributing to increased environmental harm, which raises serious questions about the validity of claims concerning the “environmental threat” of immigration and calls to reduce immigration in order to curtail environmental harm (Population-Environment Balance 1992, p. 306; see reviews in Kraly 1995, 1998; Stevens 2010). Although additional research that builds on this analysis is needed to more thoroughly explore immigration-environment relationships, our study suggests that critical commentary and policies calling for reduced immigration on the grounds that it harms the environment may not be in line with social realities.

And the economics of population-advocates don't add up. No amount of population control will actually change consumption patterns, because most environmental damage isn't local. Lyman Stone, a population and migration researcher writes this (r/https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/12/12/16766872/overpopulation-exaggerated-concern-climate-change)

The concern with overpopulation, naturally, often dovetails with concerns about climate change. *Won’t higher population devastate the environment?* We can answer that question fairly easily, making use of forecasts of population, GDP per capita, and emissions intensity per dollar by country. We can come up with some scenarios and then compare them to estimates of emissions needed to keep global warming manageable.

I show a daunting number of scenarios above, but they’re color-coded to make following them easier. The greenish lines show emissions under different population scenarios. The most steeply climbing line assumes only a modest decline in global fertility rates, while the lowest (green) scenario assumes a very rapid decline in total fertility rates — frankly, an unattainable decline.

The teal line assumes that fertility rates in every country go directly to replacement rate in 2016 (down for most poor countries, up for rich ones), and stay there. The central green line assumes fertility declines in the future following the historic trend. As you can see from these crude extrapolations, fertility rates do have substantial long-run effects on emissions.

But note those two gray lines. They’re important: They show where emissions need to go in order to prevent sharp rises in global temperatures. The paler of the two shows emissions required for less than 2 degree Celsius increase, broadly seen as the benchmark for a “serious” global warming solution. The darker gray line would get us down to a 2.5 to 2.7 degree increase, which is more or less what the Paris climate agreement committed participating countries to strive for. *No amount of population control achieves those goals.*

As an issue of political correctness, it's really not that scary to denounce green anti-immigrant hysteria for what it is. It is racist, and Malcolm King articulates the history well ([https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/rise-populationists-greenwashes-racism](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/rise-populationists-greenwashes-racism) )

 In uncertain times such as these, the populationists blame immigrants (and poor African women) for all of the woes of modern society. Between 1960 and 1980 more than 20 million people worldwide were cajoled or forced into having intrauterine device implants, hysterectomies or vasectomies. In the US they were mainly the mentally ill, single mothers and the disabled. By the 1970s, the evangelical fervour of the Third World populationist push of the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Trust and former US secretary of defense Robert McNamara, had failed to make a dent in population growth. For all of their scientific studies, propaganda, research and the millions of dollars spent, population control simply did not work.  

 Population control is far more complex than implanting IUDs, injecting people with the contraceptive Depo Provera or offering them cash to be sterilised. The anti-population literature from the 1960s and 70s is hauntingly familiar to the strident language used by the SPA and its allies here. They turned political problems into biological problems and human history was recast as natural history. The SPP, SPGN and the SPA have been picking at the scab of immigration for some years. Like Pauline Hanson in a koala suit, they cloak reactionary politics in the garb of environmentalism, but — unlike the Greens — they have no environmental credentials. They “green wash” their policies by appealing to environmental values, while promoting the tired idea that Asians, and now Africans, are waiting to invade via immigration.

Finally, to finish the discussion first off, Raphael Nawrotzki from the University of Minnesota writes that studies indicate it's possible immigrants who see a rise in living standards would actually help offset unsustainable ecological practices, and that even if it's wrong we still need to develop ethical standards to address the unavoidable phenomenon of immigration. (r/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035111 )

On the other hand, studies (see Taylor et al. 1996 and references therein) find that migration may have a very beneficial impact on migrant-sending households and communities since the additional income through remittances may relieve financial constraints and encourage investment in new technologies (e.g. drought resistant crops, rainwater harvest systems).

However, even if we assume that encouraging migration might not be the best way to address climate change induced livelihood problems, a number of reasons suggest that migration is unavoidable, thus requiring the ethical consideration of its implications: 1. Frequently, people have already lost their livelihoods through harvest failure and increased desertification and have left their homes (McLeman and Hunter 2010). For these migrants, long-term measures to improve livelihood situations in their country of origin will not provide the help necessary to improve their current situation. Also, in the case of sea level rise, where land completely disappears, adaptation “in place” is not an option (Shen and Gemenne 2011). 2. It is unlikely that transfer of funds from MDCs will be large enough to prevent livelihood destruction in all poor countries of the world and thus, outmigration is unavoidable. 3. A further problem is that LDCs frequently constitute what has been called “failed states” (Di John 2010), with highly corrupt or nonexistent governments. In such situations, it is difficult to ensure that funds for adaptation measures reach the needy population. Henceforth, it appears to be important to develop clear ethical standards to evaluate the issue of climate migration as a problematic, yet unavoidable phenomenon.

"9p7t5t","collapse","skeptical","Changing (American) politicians' stance on global warming","(Long post ahead; TLDR at bottom)

Like most of the people here, I believe that we'll be climatologically (is that a word?) fucked if we keep to the status quo. And that while individual actions such as recycling and using less electricity are helpful, we need some sort of government action in order to deal with the magnitude of the problem. And before even that happens, the public stance of Trump and the Republicans on global warming would need to change. Because let's face it, even if Democrats got enough seats in Congress to ram through awesome climate change policies, Republicans would eventually get on top again, and then could just easily repeal any legislation that the Democrats did, like they did with Obama's Clean Power Plan. So we would need a way to keep them on board for decades (at a minimum), because I really don't see the Republican Party just withering up and dying any time soon. Anyway, I've come to the conclusion that, in one sense, it's relatively easy to change their public stances, but relatively difficult in another sense.

Bribe them. Pardon me, make ""campaign contributions"".

I don't make that suggestion lightly, particularly given that I'm a liberal environmentalist with a science degree, who hates what Republicans have done to politics, and loathes the very ground that Trump walks on. It goes against the grain for nearly all my values. But sometimes, sacrifices need to be made, given that we're talking about the very habitability of the biosphere here.

Besides, you have to acknowledge that there's no scientific fact, report, or argument that scientists can produce that would suddenly make the Republicans go: ""Holy shit, you're right! We need to get on this pronto!"" The IPCC could come out with a report that shows that the climate will unequivocally go to shit the next day without action, and I still doubt that it would move the dial. That's because their public stance isn't based on reason, or scientific analysis, but because their position was bought. So throwing more reports at them in order to change things is a fools' errand. Don't talk science to them; talk politics to them. 

And if you say: ""But the fossil fuel companies can throw millions and millions of dollars at the politicians to get them to say what they want! How can we compete with that for basically 'buying' a candidate? Especially when most of us are broke AF."" The answer is: we don't. We get others to fight for us, that have a significant amount of capital, and have a financial stake in the state of the environment. Perhaps one example would be the insurance industry, since I figure that the amount of money that they're shelling out due to damage from global warming is hurting their bottom line, and they'd like to ameliorate that. At that point, it just becomes a matter of haggling over price, and what politicians are allowed to say.

You can say: ""We shouldn't have to pay politicians to do the right thing! Besides, we elected them, they should do what we say!"" Or something like that. The problem with that is that you're still thinking that we live in a democracy. Don't get me wrong: we have a lot of the trappings of a democracy. But when you get to the stuff that really matters, what we have is an oligarchy. And the sooner that we really acknowledge that, the more effective we can start being.

TL;DR: bribe politicians to do the right thing.","2018-10-18 09:52:15","4","3","0.74","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9p7t5t/changing_american_politicians_stance_on_global/","True","Rijn123","1747861630.564276","climate legislation","manual"
