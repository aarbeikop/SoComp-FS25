How much input do scientists and researchers have in determining which research areas are prioritized for federal funding? Is the money put where we can make the most progress? Issues that affect the most people? ","2017-05-04 12:35:24","15","dekker44","1747851507.6156878","climate legislation","manual"

Do you think that the increased vocal support for science that has emerged after the election is having any impact on the budget/policy-making around science? What is one thing you would advise scientists to do to help broaden support for scientific research funding in general, beyond biomedical research funding?","2017-05-04 12:56:35","12","neurobeegirl","1747851507.618746","climate legislation","manual"
"dh4awe6","t3_6974n1","6974n1","science","scientific","Thank you for your work in analyzing actions in Congress for the sake of science. How does the extreme anti-science rhetoric of the House Science GOP members factor into your analysis? In some ways, they seem to have a lot of power to introduce legislation like HR 1430 and HR 1431 that would limit the science EPA is allowed to use in policy and limit the scientists serving on advisory boards. In other ways, the budgets still have to be accepted and passed by the House which is far more moderate than the average House Science GOP member. Would changing the makeup of the GOP members to more moderate ones have an impact? Is House Science a somewhat innocuous stage for providing anti-science soundbites during hearings or should it be getting a LOT more attention than it does?","2017-05-04 13:17:55","9","AltHouseScience","1747851507.6221042","climate legislation","manual"

Do you think Trump will continue to push for budget cuts in the sciences?
Does your team put together a document for Congress and the Senate to review that summarizes programs and policies? 
What kind of updates are they allowed to make to the bill? 
What programs will most of the federal budget be placed into most heavily?","2017-05-04 13:32:24","5","DeadDollKitty","1747851507.624384","climate legislation","manual"

Researchers for DARPA projects and groups like the NRO seem to have all the funds they need to do whatever it is they're up to. I've heard a story about how the NRO gave NASA some old cold war era spy satellites they had in storage and NASA realized not only was the NRO legacy satellites decades ahead of anything they had currently but they didn't even have the means to get them into space for another decade.","2017-05-04 13:57:26","5","eskimoexplosion","1747851507.626454","climate legislation","manual"
"dh4jmm6","t3_6974n1","6974n1","science","scientific","I live in Canada, where scientific freedom has been hugely curtailed since the Harper administration - and unfortunately hasn't seemed to improve much under Trudeau. Scientists need government permission to make any findings public, which slows things down hugely and allowed the Harper government to basically muzzle environmental research.

Are you seeing a similar situation in the USA? Or have you? Is scientific freedom a contentious issue?","2017-05-04 16:08:55","3","paddywagon_man","1747851507.628858","climate legislation","manual"

"dh4af86","t3_6974n1","6974n1","science","scientific","How do you divorce the effects of legislation and funding from the other effects of an administration? Legislation often goes along with rhetoric, and I'd imagine that rhetoric would have an effect on things all by itself. How do you go about determining the cause of a given outcome? If an administration's rhetoric is contrary to the funding (e.g. anti-science rhetoric alongside a bill that *increases* science funding) how much does that confound your results? And how do you correct for those sorts of things?","2017-05-04 13:06:17","3","rslake","1747851507.6340768","climate legislation","manual"
