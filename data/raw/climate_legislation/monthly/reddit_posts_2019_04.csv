**Goal: get the most sign-ups for Citizens’ Climate Lobby by Earth Day (April 22).**

[Follow this link and submit the form to be counted toward r/Sustainability.](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3414=reddit-sustainability&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sustainability)

**Benefits of signing up:**

[Signing up](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3414=reddit-sustainability&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sustainability) costs nothing, and will give you access to training in [five levers of political will](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/levers-of-political-will/): Lobbying, Media Relations, Grassroots Outreach, Grasstops Outreach, and Chapter Development. All will be necessary to pass carbon pricing legislation, but each volunteer is free to specialize in whichever area most interests them. Becoming an active member of this group [is the most important thing an individual can do on climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8), according to NASA climatologist and climate activist [Dr. James Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hansen). 

**So what exactly is Citizens’ Climate Lobby?**

CCL is a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization focused on national policies to address climate change. Their goal is to pass legislation that immediately puts a price on carbon.

**Why carbon pricing?**

Carbon pricing [is widely accepted among experts](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/16/carbon-price-tax-cap) as an important tool to help [quickly reduce carbon emissions](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/remi-report/). Drawdown calls it “the single most impactful policy that would accelerate the adoption of every solution” in their ranked list of their top [100 solutions to solve climate change](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions). (src: [Drawdown FAQ question 5](https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions)). 

**Will carbon pricing be enough to stop climate change?**

Carbon pricing alone will not be enough, but it is a [necessary](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf) step in the right direction. More importantly, it is a step that we can take right now. CCL is the driving force behind [a bipartisan bill that has already been introduced in the US House of Representatives](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/763).

**Is CCL only in the US?**

CCL began in the US, but now has [chapters all over the world](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/chapters/) pushing for similar legislation in their countries.

**Will CCL’s proposal interfere with the Green New Deal?**

There is no reason we know of that putting a price on carbon would interfere with the Green New Deal or any other future climate legislation. The GND is a broad resolution that is still a long way from becoming law. In the meantime, carbon pricing is a plan that may be able to succeed in a conservative political landscape and significantly slow down emissions while more comprehensive climate legislation is developed.

**What if I disagree with parts of CCL’s bill?**

Ask them about it! Their legislation has just recently been introduced, and will almost certainly undergo a lot of change. By joining in the conversation, you can express your detailed concerns to your representatives and help make sure that the final version is as effective as possible. The more people we have involved the more power we have over the legislation!
