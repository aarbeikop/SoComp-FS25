I agree that the most important thing that each of us can do is to join a larger organization.  The problem is how to find the local organizations?   You could search on the internet,  I believe that it is difficult to find groups that coordinate action, because the oil lobby pays the internet giants to make it difficult. 

&#x200B;

So I linked to the groups mentioned on this posting.

More importantly  I built a map of climate change organizations.  

You can my first pass a the map here:

You can see a much more mature example of such a map here:

&#x200B;

Map problem is that there are too many  organizations for me to populate the map by hand.  Would anyone like to help me create the map for their local region?

Not surprised trans-humanism is linked with misanthropy.

"epvoopp","t3_bw53z9","bw53z9","collapse","skeptical","This is something I replied on another bunker related post. No need to be rude to me I'm just sharing what I know. Ask anything if you want to.

-----------------

As a relative to someone who's getting a bunker maybe I can answer your points. I can't reveal much details. I've been to one during it's construction and know some insights.

Yup. Bunker life is susceptible to anxiety and depression. But the people who are getting them are also undergoing multiple training sessions and medications. When the time comes they will not be held back by any psychological problem.

Nope that's not how it works. There are different levels of authority. It's a pyramid scheme. The owner (level 1) of the bunker has biometric control over air, water, and electrical systems. He has to sort of biometric login into systems after a certain period of time (once every week in case of my relative). Login is done by biometric means, typed in passwords and login patterns. After a certain number of missed or wrong logins (2 in our case) the whole bunker and resources rooms locks down. You can revert that lockdown but I can't share that here. Everybody in bunker knows it that fucking with owner of bunker is technically suicide. Food is controlled by level 2 staff. The owner just have to check numbers every 2nd or third day. Level 2 staff also provide protection to the owner and are like ceo of bunker. They are same in authority as owner except they don't have weekly login credentials and lockdown override credentials.

Nope, Nope, Nope. You aren't buying the bunker from Walmart. The construction is state of the art. You don't get loose screws after spending about a billion on a bunker. Water system, air supply, power generation etc happens in a completely different room which is connected by a shaft to the main bunker. Only owner and level 2 people can access that. The whole structure is resilient to emp, moisture, etc. The systems are very service friendly and Level 2 people are trained for general maintenance and common problems that you could face in future.

Again, how's that possible. my relative has spent over 1.05 billion on a structure and I still can't see how it could be affected by any natural force. Just tell me an example. The bunker is highly resistant to floods, tornadoes (idk how that could affect something underground),emp etc.

The entry and exit doors are completely different. Once you enter the bunker there are two doors which you have to pass through. The first door is closed and welded shut. Thn the second door is closed and welded shut. After that from a small trap door concrete is inserted between those two doors and the Gap is filled. Then that trap door is welded shut. The whole assembly is about 1.5 ft thick. The same assembly is there at the end of stairs when you've climbed down from entry tunnel. After closing both door assemblies water is filled in the entry tunnel. Exit doors are gravedoors and are situated far far away from the entry hatch.

Even if poor somehow enter our bunker which is highly highly impossible, they'll have to fight about 30-50 fully armored and armed people. Top of the line military tech. Even if they come out they'll be the new King due to the tech they have.

Yes but how can you threaten them. Yes I can threaten the president to give me launch codes but can I really do it. No. Also even if we have the launch codes I can't use the nukes because of other safety measures. Similarly even if you have access to my bunker it'll be useless to you because only me and my staff have the information about how to run it. You may steal some apples from down there but that's it. Everything is locked down and only the owner can access it. Also the staff is kept highly pleased. They are paid in millions. They have our back. They can shoot you in the middle of the road and we'll take care of it. They won't even see the face of a cop. That's the price of loyalty.

Only one thing matters,land. When the bunker owners come out after 7-10 years. They'll have guns and computers while common masses will be burning wood for fuel and fighting with swords. First they'll show you their papers to claim ownership and then they'll show you their guns to claim it. Now you are smart enough to understand who'll be the owner and who'll be the slave.","2019-06-03 06:18:33","-1","cooltechpec","1747864844.6553228","climate legislation","manual"
