As an occupant of the Midwest (near Chicago) I have noticed some erratic weather tendencies, resulting in unusual seasonal variations. Most of these result in warmer than usual temperature. But also, I have become aware of violent wind, from a steeper gradient of high pressure air mixing with cold low pressure air and in correspondence to a meandering jet stream. More intense storms, fit with quick-burst ""rain-bomb"" type occurrences. Some of these inherently are not harbingers of the exasperating condition of the environment, but soo many skewed events add up and begin to tell a tale through direct empirical observations.","2018-10-21 23:40:00","3","t41n73d","1747861335.581009","climate legislation","manual"

"e88lte1","t3_9qejpl","9qejpl","collapse","skeptical","I've always found depression to also be liberating. Not fearing death or at least not caring about it is a much better way of living. Everyone else is thinking 'I should avoid this thing I like because it might give me cancer' or 'if I do this thing that I don't like I will be healthier and live longer'. That doesn't sound like an enjoyable way to live to me.

This sub and the very idea of collapse doesn't make me any more depressed but it does make me not care about being depressed as much. When it used to get in the way of work and my social life it seemed like such a burden but now I pretty much just think 'fuck it'. I regretted leaving a job based on a snap decision because I was miserable there, I regretted everytime I didn't go out with friends or gave up on a relationship because I simply couldn't be bothered to leave the house. None of it matters though so who cares?

When I read about this stuff whilst depressed I actually find it uplifting because it makes me remember that it really doesn't matter what I do anyway. I don't know, maybe that's why people find religion comforting. The notion of being powerless?","2018-10-22 15:11:54","22","Fredex8","1747861581.015726","climate legislation","manual"
"e895roy","t3_9qejpl","9qejpl","collapse","skeptical","There's something liberating about not having to worry about the longterm future. If anything crazy can happen, why worry about your retirement fund or your property values? It's a perverse form of escapism, where the current rules of society get thrown out the window in favor of an entirely different set. It means you aren't stuck in the current system anymore, and can potentially make it in an entirely new way of life. I think this is why apocalypse and zombie movies are so appealing.

But I really don't believe it's going to play out quite that dramatically in our lifetime. I think it's going to be a steady slow decline, where the chains of the current system simply tighten until more and more people are squeezed for everything. There isn't going to be a post-apocalypse freedom that comes with the glorious re-building of society, just an environment in which living becomes increasingly harder, more dangerous, and more expensive again.","2018-10-22 19:40:16","14","adriennemonster","1747861581.017876","climate legislation","manual"

"e8aame9","t3_9qejpl","9qejpl","collapse","skeptical","I only realized recently that the original Star Trek and 2001 timeline is never happening. Also, knowing that Thermal Runaway will be ramping up after 2070, there is very little chance the human ape ever leaves the surface of this planet for good. It will be a long lingering extinction for several decades, stuck on the surface of the Earth, with the infrastructure for interplanetary travel no longer available. Following the anthropology findings of the past few years, the human ape is the last surviving species of the Great African Ape hominid family. H. Erectus emerged from Africa around 1 million years ago, had Neanderthal and Denisovan branchings about 400,000 years ago, then went extinct. The first H.Sapiens that emerged from Africa after that, around 100,000 to 200,000 years ago, also went almost extinct about 75,000 years ago, a few thousand survivors at the south tip of Africa. These survivors became H. Sapien Sapiens, the modern human ape, and started emerging from Africa about 70,000 years ago. These modern human apes encountered the previous H. Sapien that had emerged from Africa, the Neanderthal and Denisovan, and within 30,000 years, they all went extinct. It is being stated that 99.9% of all life that existed before has gone extinct.  
https://www.aei.org/publication/99-9-of-all-species-have-already-gone-extinct/  
  
After realizing the human ape is probably looking at species extinction in full swing in 100 years has been kind of a relief, disappointing but probably for the best. The violent, murderous human ape is a slow learner and is too stupid to save itself.

"e8gcmki","t3_9rcljp","9rcljp","collapse","skeptical",">First, as an issue of source-knowledge, we should be skeptical of the green anti-immigrants and anti-population folks such as Tanton, Hardin, and Ehrlich. They were kicked out of the Sierra Club for a reason, and it's not ""political correctness.""

It very much was -- the Sierra Club consisted of the kind of people more committed to maintaining their upper class status than to actually doing anything about the environment, which is why they abandoned the environment once it threatened to hurt their social status by becoming too inconvenient of a topic. 

But that is besides the point. More importantly:

>As an issue of political correctness, it's really not that scary to denounce green anti-immigrant hysteria for what it is. It is racist, and Malcolm King articulates the history well (https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/rise-populationists-greenwashes-racism )

Even if those people were racist, racism is of utterly trivial significance compared to the consequences of overpopulation. 

The complete extermination, enslavement, subjugation, any other kind of mistreatment, of any subgroup of humanity, no matter how large, is an entirely acceptable price to pay if global civlizational collapse is to be averted. 

Because, and people really need to understand it very well, there will not be another advanced civilization on this planet once we are done.
