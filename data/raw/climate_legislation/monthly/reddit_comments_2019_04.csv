* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). 

* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). 

* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  

* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). 

* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.

* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. 

* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). 

* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. 

* I gave two [presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/159) to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee & Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for. I [arranged these presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/160) myself. 

* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously ""Safe Passage""](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)

* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee & Dividend and try to get their support. 

It may be that at least some of these things are having an impact. [Just five years ago, only 30% of Americans supported a carbon tax](http://closup.umich.edu/issues-in-energy-and-environmental-policy/13/public-views-on-a-carbon-tax-depend-on-the-proposed-use-of-revenue/). Today, [it's over half](https://news.gallup.com/poll/232007/americans-want-government-more-environment.aspx). If you think Congress doesn't care about public support, [think again](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651). 

Furthermore, the [evidence clearly shows](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf) that [lobbing works](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/june-2017-meeting-analysis-1127.pdf), and [you don't need a lot of money to be effective](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41759323?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). 

And the IPCC has been clear that [carbon pricing is **necessary**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf) if we're going to make our 1.5 ºC target.
