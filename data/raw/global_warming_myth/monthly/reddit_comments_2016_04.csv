Here are a few papers describing warm periods in the past.   The first ties today's climate to the last interglacial.   The second describes the mid-Miocene,  a time when the earth was quite similar to today and atmospheric CO2 levels were over 500 ppm.   The third paper explains the mid-Pliocene warm period.   The forth reference is from Wikipedia and is an excellent paper discussing the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum.   This was a time when mammals were well established and the climate was much warmer than all but the most extreme predictions for our future.

Hello there!

>I read the paper and its pretty convincing.

This is a strange claim to make from someone who is blatantly misrepresenting the paper's contents and the views of its authors.

>they argue that the slowdown was real and current climate models aren't particularly effective. 

I have coauthored with Michael Mann and speak to him regularly. He has published several papers showing that climate models do just fine **when one takes the care to ensure that the phasing of natural variability in the models is the same as that of the observations**. 

Why would think that it was a good idea to misrepresent Mann and his work? Did you think no one would call you out on it?

11 944 papers analyzed. Of all the abstracts, 32.6% endorse Antropomorphic Global Warming (3896). On the other side, 66.4% of the papers (7930) have NO position whatsoever. 0.7% reject it, and 0.3% are uncertain. People are mislead as to what the actual numbers are behind this study, it is not a meere 3% who reject or are uncertain, it is more like 66.4% who do not even have a position on the subject, maybe because they don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly? I really don't know, i'm asking.

Out of the 32.6% who endorse it, 97.1% actually have a POSITION on the subject. So, if i take into account the 11 944 papers analyzed, it is still 32.6% of all the papers reviewed, not 97.1%. Quote from the study:

> The ISI search generated 12 465 papers. Eliminating papers that were not peer-reviewed (186), not climate-related (288) or without an abstract (47) reduced the analysis to 11 944 

So, my question is, who is the 66.4% that has no position? But they are climate related? They are peer reviewed and have an abstract. It wasn't even taken into account. The soul purpuse of this study is to see if there is a consensus on the matter, and the only thing i see it 32.6? out of 11 944 papers endorse and have a position on antropomorphic climate change. Not 97.1%. 

I think this is more of a public relations scheme more than anything, in the conclusion of the study it says quite clearly:

> The public perception of a scientific consensus on AGW is a necessary element in public support for climate policy (Ding et al 2011)

> The narrative presented by some dissenters is that the scientific consensus is '...on the point of collapse' (Oddie 2012) while '...the number of scientific ""heretics"" is growing with each passing year' (Allègre et al 2012).

Am I an Heretic to question this study?

> The situation is exacerbated by media treatment of the climate issue, where the normative practice of providing opposing sides with equal attention has allowed a vocal minority to have their views amplified (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004).

And why we should make this a one sided argument? Isn't this what science is about? Consider both sides? Debate in a civilized way? Not just slam and push it aside?
