Then it kinda went away. Now its Global Warming. Same alarms, same threats, same everything it seems. Even NASA scientists  speculate these facts about it:

And then there are people who are going a step further and outright calling bullshit on the entire thing:

Now Im obviously not a scientist. Im not even a college grad in anything that matters when it comes to weather and such. I do know however, that people can make up a threat to attack an idea or a way of life to bring fear to people who allow their minds and hearts to be easily fooled. I clearly see this happening in various other subjects across the nation and the world abroad. 

No, I'm not saying climate change doesn't exist. Im not saying that It's going to end up destroying the world in a year either. I'm saying that when there is so much debate on something like this, where there are two very large sides debating it back and forth (especially when its about the fate of the planet and obviously us within it), I believe the truth is somewhere in between. Maybe climate change is real? Maybe its not nearly the threat people exagerate it for profit make it seem?

Just some thoughts I had I figured I'd share.","2015-05-24 05:06:02","0","6","0.38","https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/372ba4/so_whatever_happened_to_global_cooling/","True","Fox436","1747752796.735466","global warming myth","manual"
"34tcge","science","scientific","Science AMA Series: I am John Cook, Climate Change Denial researcher, Climate Communication Fellow for the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, and creator of SkepticalScience.com. Ask Me Anything!","Hi r/science,
I study Climate Change Science and the psychology surrounding it. I co-authored the college textbook Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis, and the book Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand. I've published papers on scientific consensus, misinformation, agnotology-based learning and the psychology of climate change. I'm currently completing a doctorate in cognitive psychology, researching the psychology of consensus and the efficacy of inoculation against misinformation.

I co-authored the 2011 book Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand with Haydn Washington, and the 2013 college textbook Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis with Tom Farmer. I also lead-authored the paper Quantifying the Consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature, which was tweeted by President Obama and was awarded the best paper published in Environmental Research Letters in 2013. In 2014, I won an award for Best Australian Science Writing, published by the University of New South Wales.

I am currently completing a PhD in cognitive psychology, researching how people think about climate change. I'm also teaching a MOOC (Massive Online Open Course), [Making Sense of Climate Science Denial](https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x), which started last week. 

I'll be back at **5pm EDT (2 pm PDT, 11 pm UTC)** to answer your questions, Ask Me Anything! 

Edit: I'm now online answering questions. ([Proof](https://twitter.com/denial101x/status/595332406409834496))

Edit 2 (7PM ET): Have to stop for now, but will come back in a few hours and answer more questions.

Edit 3 (~5AM): Thank you for a great discussion! Hope to see you in class.
