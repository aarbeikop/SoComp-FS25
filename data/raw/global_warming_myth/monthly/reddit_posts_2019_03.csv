"az25ki","climate","scientific","What are the first things caused by global warming non-scientific people will start to notice, which will have a real negative impact on their lives?","I'm looking for things that are news-worthy, and could really start to attract the attention of citizens and the media.

For example, news about the fauna and other rise in average temperature don't have a negative impact on people's live because they might not be science-litterate, and it might not change how they eat and consume.

What are the first events or of the most obvious signs that people will notice that are caused by global warming?

PS: my question was both removed in /r/askscience and /r/explainlikeimfive

I'm looking for an realist, scientific, ""alarmist"" but not paranoiac ""doom and gloom"" answer. I've heard nobody can really answer how human society will answer to problems and where it's going to result in crisis, since there are butterfly effects.","2019-03-09 10:26:35","675","258","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/az25ki/what_are_the_first_things_caused_by_global/","True","PenisShapedSilencer","1747799608.999136","global warming myth","manual"
