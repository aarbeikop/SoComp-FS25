"4jbigy","collapse","skeptical","Is Alex Jones evil, insane or simply bought and paid for?","I think this is something that's worth addressing. Here's a guy, who attracts millions of the world's angriest most disenfranchised people, then goes on to feed them complete hogwash. If you have a show dedicated to addressing nefarious conspiracies by people plotting against our best interest, [surely you would be interested in the fact that oil companies researched the climate change caused by fossil fuels, only to use their advance knowledge to wage a war of disinformation against anyone who tries to ring the alarm bells?](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968) This is the most pure and unadulterated form of evil imaginable, of people willing to destroy the whole planet just to protect their own individual greed. But he won't touch it.

Now, it's one thing to be wrong. You'd imagine that watching the Australian Great Barrier Reef die, massive droughts threatening famines throughout Africa and a stunning global temperature explosion to knew heights, would make a man consider that he might have been wrong and change his opinion, or at least shut up about it. But that's not what happens. 

[Here's Alex Jones from a few days ago, hosting a show with Lord Monckton, ""The Day The Climate Change Myth Died"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGSZLodVkIY) Instead of acknowledging the open conspiracy of entrenched corporate greed by people who have no higher calling in life than to enrich themselves and buy private yets and yachts, the narrative is rearranged, to portray a hypothetical conspiracy where global warming is used as a myth to implement some sort of global tyranny, for no clear reason other than some people's apparent desire to have global tyranny for its own sake.

[Go back a few years, and we find Alex Jones and his cronies peddling the idea that peak oil is a myth.](http://www.prisonplanet.com/archives/peak_oil/index.htm) Why is peak oil a myth? Because supposedly there are mysterious deep geological reserves from which oil flows upwards, allowing you to permanently retrieve more oil from the same wells. This bullshit was peddled exactly at a time when oil prices were going through the roof. 

[Of course these are the same people who claim that 90+% of the world's population is going to be eradicated with weaponized ebola.](http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/april2006/040406_b_depopulation.htm) Their evidence is mostly based on a herpetologist in Texas who's worried that overpopulation threatens an ecological catastrophe. But apparently, this secret plot to eradicate most of the world's population [no longer deserves precedence over funny videos of angry feminist college students.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFrZsGbO6N0)

So what's going on here? To reiterate, we have a guy here, who spews disinformation on three problems that are going to define our lives in the 21st century: Overpopulation, fossil fuel depletion and climate change. Note that he doesn't express ""skepticism"", he spews an internally consistent anti-narrative, in which every real problem we face is in fact a hoax, created by evil powerful men lurking behind the scenes who wish to gain more control over us. How exactly does this happen?

It's possible that Alex Jones is just stupid and/or mentally ill, leading him to believe in his own hallucinations. It's also possible that Alex Jones is evil and knows what he's doing. He creates a unified conspiratorial narrative that intuitively appeals to people, as it portrays a group of evil powerful men that meet in secret at the Bilderberg group, who ultimately wish to eradicate the majority of the human population, with only himself and his cronies as people actively dedicated to addressing this problem. Because nobody else competes in this economic niche, it ensures that he keeps sufficient fans/cash crops to afford a wealthy lifestyle. It also has the side effect of ensuring that all their anger and energy and up misdirected, cast at faces in the clouds.

Alternatively, it's attractive to consider the possibility that Alex Jones receives money from the oil industry in one form or another. He creates a counternarrative that they could never overtly associate themselves with, but appeals to a naturally anti-authoritarian demographic for whom the general propaganda (global warming is exaggerated/not caused by humans/there's still enough oil out there) doesn't really work. Any thoughts? What explains this phenomenon?

"4ihf3k","collapse","skeptical","This Is the Way that the World Will End: Peter Ward on Greenhouse Mass Extinction","Peter D. Ward is an American paleontologist, a professor at the University of Washington and a prolific author for the lay reader of science fact. The principal area of his research has been the mass extinction events of Earth’s history. Peter Ward was among the first declare that several of these events were ‘Greenhouse Extinctions’, and the evidence continues to accumulate that he is correct to do so. I developed this post in recognition of the three books he has written on the subject. I find my thinking crystalizing around them.

*Under the Green Sky: Global Warming, the Mass Extinctions of the Past, and What They Can Tell Us About Our Future* (2007)

This volume examines the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event, the most devastating of the Big Five Mass Extinctions. Paleontologists call this ‘The Great Dying’, for it appears from the fossil record that over 90% of complex species, both terrestrial and marine, perished from Earth over a brief geological period. This is a handy scorecard for ‘Big Five’.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/extinction_events

With the 1980 discovery of the Chicxulub asteroid impact by Luis and Walter Alvarez and its clear association with the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction, many paleontologists took this as a the common cause for these events, and geologists began to search for ancient impact craters just as crime scene investigators look for bullet holes. Others disagreed; indeed, a few still argue that the extinction of the dinosaurs was ongoing before the *coup de grace* of Chicxulub. Much of *Green Sky* examines this contentious academic debate and follows Ward’s own fieldwork on the ‘Great Dying’ (He studies the marine mollusks of that period.). He judged that the means of execution had not been the bang of the cosmic firing squad but a whimpering death inside of a terrestrial gas chamber. What follows is my brief, and inadequate, description of the proposed ‘killing mechanism’.

It begins with an exogenous shock to the Biosphere. In the case of the Permian-Triassic Extinction, it was the eruption of a system of volcanoes in what is today Siberia. For a million years the eruptions continued, until the molten flow had buried two million square kilometers, a geological feature known as the Siberian Traps. In addition to the carbon dioxide from the Earth’s interior, these eruptions would have vaporized extensive, overlying coal deposits, and the subsequent warming might have destabilized methane clathrates and other carbon sinks as well. The intense spike in global temperature strongly suggests the creation of a ‘runaway greenhouse’.

How hot was it? The Wiki page sources a 2012 paper published in *Science*, titled ‘Lethally Hot Temperatures During the Early Triassic Greenhouse’ that estimates *ocean surface temperatures of 40C (104F)*.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event

The prevailing winds drive currents over the surface of the ocean, and thermohaline conveyers move the deep waters of the ocean basins in circulatory loops that span the globe. Most who have bothered to read this far know about the Gulf Stream and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, so I will not struggle to explain the details of this system. What is critical is that both the prevailing winds and the deep-sea currents result from *differences in temperatures between equatorial and polar regions*, and as more uniform temperatures come to an ice-free, hothouse Earth, *this circulation will cease to occur*. The thermohaline conveyer is what replenishes oxygen in the deep ocean basins, and Peter Ward believes that interrupting it will result in another reprise of the hypothesized Canfield Ocean of a billion years ago. This stratified ocean will be both anoxic and sulfidic, that is, it is devoid of oxygen and full of hydrogen sulfide, the highly toxic gas that smells like rotten eggs.

Where will the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas come from? Before cyanobacteria evolved, there was very little free oxygen (O2) on Earth, yet the world swarmed with microbial life. Some of these anaerobic organisms performed photosynthesis too, but instead of O2, they produced and used H2S. Contrarily, O2 is toxic to them, and so, such sulfur bacteria now exist only in marginal environments, notably in the ecosystems of the ‘black smoking’ vents in the deep ocean. However, should a warm, stagnant, oxygen-free Canfield Ocean recur, they find themselves at home again throughout its waters.

As sulfur bacteria reclaim the depths of the Canfield Ocean, H2S will rise in the water column, killing any aerobic organisms that are surviving the heat. Once this H2S environment reaches the sunlit upper layer, photosynthetic green and purple sulfur bacteria will bloom profusely. There is evidence of this in the fossil layers of the Permian-Triassic. Peter Ward believes that the H2S concentration can rise to a lethal level in the atmosphere as well, to the extent that it will turn the blue sky to ""a washed green tinge, a vomitous [sic] color.” In addition, H2S will scrub away the ozone layer, allowing more UV radiation to shine down upon a torrid, poisoned world. This can explain why maybe as few as *four percent of known species* survived an existence *Under a Green Sky*.

Ward’s next book continued this theme: *The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?* (2009).

Essentially, this is a refutation of James Lovelock’s Gaia theory. In an apt contrast to the loving Earth Mother Gaia, Medea is a figure of Greek myth and drama who, as an act of revenge against her husband, murders her own children. In Ward’s Medea Hypothesis, the Biosphere (and it is important to note that the Biosphere has always been largely microbial) does not regulate itself to maintain the Earth in a habitable state; rather, the microbial component is itself the usual cause of mass extinctions.

Ward’s list of such auto-extinction events includes the Great Oxygenation Event where cyanobacteria drove sulfur-loving life to the margins, two Snowball Earths where the *depletion of greenhouse gasses* (is this irony?) caused the Earth to freeze over, and at least five mass extinctions of more complex life by the Runaway Greenhouse and its Hydrogen Sulfide.

Here is a ten-minute, YouTube audio clip from *Radio Ecoshock* program where Ward himself explains his book.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICbrSgfyQqQ

*The Medea Hypothesis* offers a disturbing insight – the much vaunted Balance of Nature may be as much of a myth as the Self-Regulating Market of Adam Smith. Ward ends the book with the bold assertion that human survival requires us to become the geo-engineering custodians of the planet, not only to correct our own depredations, but in preparation for ones that the Biosphere can manifest on its own. Mass extinction is not always a random event; it is an intrinsic property of Life itself.

Finally (hurrah! tl;dr) the trilogy ends with a book titled *The Flooded Earth: Our Future In a World Without Ice Caps* (2010). Ward presents our future with a series of science-fictional scenarios, notably tagged with the rising measurements of sea level and ppm of CO2. Drowned islands, port cities and farmlands, a hundred million peasants displaced from Bangladesh, the Netherlands reclaimed by the North Sea: all the very familiar stuff is here, and so I found this to be the least interesting of the books. Ward offers three outcomes for our future, which I interpret as

- Chicken Little: The greenhouse deniers were right. We are in for a mild inconvenience. This is, of course, Pure Bullshit.

- Heroic Humanity: A rapid conversion away from fossil fuels and extensive geo-engineering hold the rise of temperature to under 2C and that of the ocean to two meters. This will be a mere global catastrophe but not our extinction. For me, this may be possible but is not likely.

> “Then there is the third possibility, the one as a scientist I believe is the most likely: the ice sheets will melt rapidly, the sea rises, and all the scenarios set forth in this book come to pass.”

I call this one, Nothing but Green Skies Do I See. For it, Ward offered a final scenario:

>Old Seattle, 5115 CE. Carbon Dioxide at 1,200 ppm.

And this is my paraphrase of it.

Eighty meters of sea level rises has left some of the few inhabitants of the Future living on the seven small coastal islands that were once the hills beneath Seattle. With Earth at a new and much higher temperature, they subsist on a few tropical crops (most animals, and especially birds, are now extinct) and struggle to breath the sulfur dioxide (Ward claims that humans have a higher tolerance for the gas than most mammals). The stinking poison wafts from the purple Western Canfield Ocean (photosynthetic purple sulfur bacteria now mat the surface of the former Pacific Ocean), and they squint through cataracts (from UV exposure) at the sick Green Horizon.

Ward suggests a rough timeline to this anthropomorphic Greenhouse Extinction. First comes another few centuries of Fossil-Fueled Civilization.

> “What began as an industrial revolution in the 1800s and progressed as an oil economy in the 1900s, only to end as a coal economy in the 2100s and 2200s, will offer us a recipe for potential human extinction.” Pg.147

That is from the middle of the book, but the basis for that eye-popping ‘1200 ppm’ has to be an assumption that we will end up burning everything can. Afterward comes a Total Collapse of both Civilization and ocean circulation, and a two thousand year interval for the ocean basins to go completely anoxic and stew with sulfur-loving organisms. Then, allow another 500 years for the photosynthetic zone to fill with green and purple sulfur bacteria. Compared to timetables to human extinction projected by Guy McPherson or Robert Scribbler, this seems a leisurely pace.

Can we actually reach 1200 ppm of CO2? One thing I learned from this book is that the thermohaline sinking also carries carbon dioxide into the deep ocean basins, where it reacts with carbonate sediments. This is one of the more effective carbon sinks, but our present rate of combustion is overwhelming its capacity. Should the ocean circulation begin to shut down, will that cause atmospheric CO2 levels to rise even faster? Now, let me try to tally up the available carbon. Burn all the extractable fossil fuels, lose most of the forests and grasslands, fire the clathrate gun and thaw all the carbon from the permafrost: someone who reads this will have a better grasp of the arithmetic, but to me, it seems doable. What an achievement! We are now as mighty, and just as mindless, as those ancient Siberian volcanoes.

What is alarming is how out-of-date the data in this relatively recent book is. Ward writes about current levels of CO2 at 385ppm – ah, those were the days. He considers whether James Hansen’s *previous projections* of ice sheet melt and sea level rise were excessive – what must he think of the new, accelerated schedule? He suggests geo-engineering projects that we now consider as unfeasible -- by the way, when all of that cooling sulfate aerosol precipitates into the oceans, is that just fertilizer for sulfur-loving microbes? I could list here a dozen papers that support his thesis, ones that have appeared here on r/Collapse in the past year, but this is post has rambled on much too long.

Are we already past the point of no return? Survival of this event will analogous to Humanity holding its collective breath for many millennia. This existential threat is real, it demands extreme action now, and yet not one in a thousand are aware of it.

I end with a plug for what I consider to be Peter D. Ward’s best book:
*Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe* with Donald Brownlee (2000)

The title says it all. His Greenhouse Extinction Trilogy may be only a tragic postscript to that book.

This is something that is not very widely discussed, which is worrying.  Obviously beef makes a lot of money, if we think about how much must be used on a single day by the likes of McDonald's.  Any way, many people take the mindset of not worrying about these issues, saying it won't matter this century - it will.
