"eyvijfh","t3_cyznyy","cyznyy","climatechange","action-oriented","All plants and animals have evolved to live in a certain climate. Put an organism evolved somewhere thousands of kilometers towards the equator, and it won't survive. Also the rate at which the climate is changing means that the large majority of organisms won't be able to move towards the poles fast enough. And if one part of an ecosystem dies (e.g. forests in Germany now that are mostly one species of tree, and that species dies), the whole ecosystem that depends on that species will follow.

In short, _all ecosystems are in dangers of just dying_. The effects are much broader and more extreme than the things you mention, horrible as they are.

And climate change is something that needs _extreme action now_, or the warming in the coming centuries becomes inevitable. Once fossil fuel is out of the Earth, it _will_ be burned and the CO2 is here to stay for millions of years, with its isolating effect that builds up over the years.","2019-09-03 07:34:35","3","[deleted]","1747812778.423894","global warming myth","manual"

"f16anox","t3_d7y2uz","d7y2uz","collapse","skeptical","Among people of Chinese/Sinic, Korean and Japanese sphere ... confidence in technology and engineering and infrastructure.

Chinese, Koreans and Japanese do not generally doubt that there is climate change and global warming. In fact, there is great concern. Chinese watch first hand the effect of pollution and knows how it can change things for the worse ( this permeates all levels of Chinese society ). Koreans know the effect of local pollution all too well and also know that the climate is changing unpleasantly. Japanese are the same too. 

The Chinese at least do not have a farm disconnect as many Chinese still have farming link ( so know the stress in the rural area either directly or through relatives ). 

What however causes a general lack of concern about climate change ( beyond maybe driving less and a zeal for recycling and not using too much plastic bags nowadays ), is technological confidence.

There is a confidence that our technology will improve to the point we can engineer the climate. This will spare us from global warming’s worse effect. The solution to global warming is hence more R&D into how to fix it. 

This also is why the trade war is frowned upon by many sides in Asia when it comes to climate change. To deal with climate change most East Asians universally agree it requires infrastructure. This means money. To combat climate change means the economy needs to boom so that infrastructures designed to built it can be made. From forested buildings ( ie:- buildings with trees and bushes growing around it ), to self contained energy buildings ( water, solar etc.. ) to aerial farms ( to capture carbon and feed the city ) to hi-tech national parks ( to protect animals from poachers ) ... all these are not cheap and require a booming economy to sustain.","2019-09-23 02:49:09","31","Astalon18","1747813326.659269","global warming myth","manual"

"f16xt00","t3_d7y2uz","d7y2uz","collapse","skeptical","I would also add to this that there's no ""simple"" solution to climate change.

With the hole in the ozone layer, the fix was to replace CFCs with a less damaging alternative. It wasn't hugely expensive and didn't call for a grounds-up redesign of all air conditioners and refrigerators. Simple enough fix.

With the Y2K bug, the solution was software patches. Again, relatively simple.

Even with problems like industrial pollution, the answer is *relatively* simple: better regulations, which governments will enforce with enough public pressure and bad PR. 

But with climate change? There's no single silver bullet solution that you can roll out and still live your normal life as a busy consumer and citizen. And even if you're prepared to make all those drastic, expensive and inconvenient life changes-- ride a bicycle everywhere and/or drive a hybrid, recycle your water, compost your garbage, not have kids, install expensive solar panels on your roof, you name it-- there's still no measurable finish line to cross. To put another way: exactly how much should I ride my bicycle in traffic like a suicidal lunatic to and from work, before I can say that I stopped climate change? What difference do all my actions make if I'm the only freakin' idiot doing all this crap?

Even if everyone-- and I do mean **everyone, everywhere--** would take truly drastic and extreme measures to cut their carbon footprint (which is itself borderline impossible, I mean we're talking about stopping **all** carbon emissions) we might, just **might** have a snowball's chance in hell of averting the disasters ahead, many of which have already been set into motion from the last several decades of industrially fucking the planet. 

So... yeah. Our best bet is if the entire human race suddenly and collectively decided to abandon all modern comfort and live like the fucking Unabomber. 

What exactly do you think are the odds of that? Consider that the world was horrified to hear about the working conditions at Foxconn, where the iPhones are made. Employees working for peanuts for 20 hours a day, committing suicide from the stress. Did people stop buying iPhones? Nope. And that was a simple enough solution, a simple enough action to take-- you didn't even have to stop using phones altogether, you just had to avoid one specific brand of phone. And it would have made a direct, measurable impact on the injustice we were all outraged at. And even that little action was too much for most of us to make (myself included, I confess). 

More recently the company run by the richest man in the world decided to slash health benefits. Everyone's outraged, yet everyone's still buying from Amazon and watching Prime. Such simple actions are too much for the average idiot to take. 

And now you're telling me we all have to quit using oil and plastic altogether, with few viable alternatives to switch to? Are you seriously surprised nobody's rising to the challenge here?

tl;dr we're fucked.

1.) The scientific community (rightly) has been screaming at the top of their lungs since the 80s about climate change.  Those who remember the apocalyptic messaging back then really couldn't give two shits now -- they aren't feeling it, so it isn't true.

2.) When each decade has spawned its own turmoil, its difficult to put a national focus on climate change.  In the 1980s, if regearing our economy meant Soviet tanks would be pouring through the Fulda Gap at the nearest opportunity, what was the point?  

I can understand why a politician might put more worry into defense than means to mitigate climate change.
