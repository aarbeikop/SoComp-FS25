"ecfiyfb","t3_a8yrmp","a8yrmp","sustainability","action-oriented","I think its because a lot of materials can actually be reclaimed from used electronics, and there are a lot of incentives to not use toxic materials I.e. Rohs. I think the big issues to be tackled are inbuilt obsolescence and issues like hardware locking which are causing huge problems. Mobile phone sales are actually slowing as the innovation seems to be hitting a limit. I'm a big believer in concepts like cradle to cradle and the circular economy and feel that these ideas need to be adopted asap to really address the problem. By leaving manufacturers responsible for their products and materials for their entire lifecycle should slow the process down and dramatically reduce waste and also increase quality of the products process may also be lower as you only really pay to rent a product and for the r&d outlay. Not sure why people don't talk about this much, I think it's not well understood and everyone relies on electronics (possibly afraid of being hypocritical). Look for examples such as the fairphone for manufacturers who are actually trying to make a change to obsolescence, hardware locking and ethical sourcing.","2018-12-24 01:58:56","13","[deleted]","1747797675.220474","global warming myth","manual"

"ecfyn9w","t3_a8yrmp","a8yrmp","sustainability","action-oriented","I think the issue with e-waste is that although it's harmful to extract, and very harmful to throw away, it's also exceptionally easy to recycle, and so over time as recycling becomes an economic necessity to remain competitive (the cost of recycling vs extraction decreases all the time) recycling will naturally become the norm. By comparison the petroleum and meat industries are far more difficult to reform, even if they cause less damage on a gram by gram basis.","2018-12-24 06:23:46","3","twoWYES","1747797675.230678","global warming myth","manual"
"ecgx2yg","t3_a8yrmp","a8yrmp","sustainability","action-oriented","There is electronic recycling so not all of it just gets thrown in landfills. But a lot of people may be ignorant about what  electronics they shouldn't throw away or where to go to recycle electronics, so perhaps there needs to be more efforts to educate people.

Compare to wood timber which has to be replaced by composite (e.g. fiberglass plastic) lumbers for any hope of going carbon negative, and is many times the volume involved.","2018-12-24 09:19:56","2","jsalsman","1747797675.234755","global warming myth","manual"

"ecqwgb9","t3_aacsl5","aacsl5","sustainability","action-oriented","That's basically insurance for the value of the product/production trying to justify a higher value with fair trade pricing. A policy like this would be expensive, especially since insurance rates for disaster relief in general are going up. 

One of the business groups that has been making noise about climate change are re-insurers, who are basically insurance companies who ensure insurance companies, because the increased frequency of severe climate is making their policies more expensive.","2018-12-28 18:46:52","2","levthelurker","1747797695.137488","global warming myth","manual"

Everyone should have access to a safety net funded by taxes so they don't starve or become homeless if they lose their job due to a natural or economic disaster.
