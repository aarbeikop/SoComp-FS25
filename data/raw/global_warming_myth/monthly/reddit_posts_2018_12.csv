Water shortages could affect 5bn people by 2050, UN report warns

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/19/water-shortages-could-affect-5bn-people-by-2050-un-report-warns


By 2020 about 30-40% of the world will have water scarcity, and according to the researchers, climate change can make this even worse.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140729093112.htm

With only 7% of the world’s freshwater, China plans to produce 807 million gallons a day from desalination by 2020, roughly quadruple the country’s current capacity.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-09/china-embraces-desalination-to-ease-water-shortages

By 2025, an estimated 1.8 billion people will live in areas plagued by water scarcity, with two-thirds of the world’s population living in water-stressed regions.

http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/freshwater-crisis/ 

There will be about 1 billion more mouths to feed worldwide by 2025 and global agriculture alone will require another 1 trillion cubic meters of water per year (equal to the annual flow of 20 Niles or 100 Colorado Rivers).

http://www.interactioncouncil.org/world-confronts-serious-water-crisis-former-heads-government-and-experts-warn-new-report

UN studies project that 30 nations will be water scarce in 2025, up from 20 in 1990.

http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/2011622193147231653.html

According to the U.S. Intelligence Community Assessment of Global Water Security, by 2030 humanity’s “annual global water requirements” will exceed “current sustainable water supplies” by 40%.

http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/the-coming-global-water-crisis/256896/

Water demand in India will reach 1.5 trillion cubic meters in 2030 while India’s current water supply is only 740 billion cubic meters.

http://www.mckinsey.com/client_service/sustainability/latest_thinking/charting_our_water_future

If current usage trends don’t change, the world will have only 60 percent of the water it needs in 2030.

http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/20/world/asia/ap-world-water-crisis.html?_r=0

By 2035, the world’s energy consumption will increase by 35 percent, which in turn will increase water use by 15 percent according to the International Energy Agency.

http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/01/16/will-water-constrain-our-energy-future

By the year 2040 there will not be enough water in the world to quench the thirst of the world population and keep the current energy and power solutions going if we continue doing what we are doing today.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140729093112.htm

The number of people living in river basins under severe water stress is projected to reach 3.9 billion by 2050, totaling over 40% of the world’s population.

http://www.globalwaterforum.org/2012/05/21/water-outlook-to-2050-the-oecd-calls-for-early-and-strategic-action/

Compared to today, five times as much land is likely to be under “extreme drought” by 2050.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6068348.stm

Feeding 9 billion people by 2050, will require a 60 percent increase in agricultural production and a 15 percent increase in water withdrawals.

http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/overview

Water demand is projected to grow by 55 percent by 2050 (including a 400-percent rise in manufacturing water demand).

http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/03/hot-crowded-and-running-out-of-fuel-earth-of-2050-a-scary-place/

By 2050, 1 in 5 developing countries will face water shortages (UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization).

http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2012/1202/Global-water-crisis-too-little-too-much-or-lack-of-a-plan

Between 2050 and 2100, there is an 85 percent chance of a drought in the Central Plains and Southwestern United States lasting 35 years or more.

http://www.livescience.com/49794-megadrought-prediction-southwest-plains.html

If farmers in Kansas keep irrigating at present rates, 69 percent of the Ogallala Aquifer will be gone in 50 years.

"a8yrmp","sustainability","action-oriented","How come there seems to be do little discussion about the unsustainability of producing electronics?","I love technology and really appreciate how useful smartphones, computers and everything else is but I'm pretty worried how there seems to be so little attention to the problems of producing electronics: I think most of us know about blood minerals, miserable conditions of places like the Apple factories and realize anything slightly outdated is dumped to a landfill instantly. Constantly though everything is turned into needless smart devices (like toothbrushes) and screens are put to any possible place, like having tablets attached to shopping carts. Still, I see very little talk about this issue. Global warming, overfishing or animal rights at least are out there, but why isn't this? Are we just so blind to it because everything is so new, nice and fancy?

"aacsl5","sustainability","action-oriented","Fair Trade Disaster Protection.","Policy idea for farmers.
Name: Fair Trade Disaster Protection. 
Contingent on natural disasters and certain qualifying human disasters.
If a natural or human disaster has occurred within 2-6 months, depending on severity, 1/2 the difference between the agreed upon price is to be given to the farmer. 

For simplicity's sake, let's say that 1lb (2.2kg is $1 normally under fair trade. A flood comes through the field. The market price for coffee in the area is now $5. That means $2 is added to the value, so it is now $3. 

Why do we need something like this? 
Global warming has partially caused and definitely exacerbated storms in recent years. 

I just don't know how it would be funded, but I would encourage the money going to smaller farms over larger ones. 

Thoughts?","2018-12-28 18:21:26","2","4","0.75","https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/aacsl5/fair_trade_disaster_protection/","True","tenorsaxhero","1747797694.852108","global warming myth","manual"
