"cyznyy","climatechange","action-oriented","Why is “global warming” our biggest focus environmentally?","To start, of course I understand global warming is real. (ETA I understand global warming is real and CATASTROPHIC. I am terrified about how we are destroying the planet and personally believe it will likely happen much faster than we are currently predicting). 

But for a while, I’ve struggled to shake the feeling that the term “global warming” and the focus we give it is being pushed to the forefront by the people who are the biggest offenders in the climate crisis. 

Before you shrug it off - the earth getting “warmer” is the only thing about ecological destruction that *doesn’t* cause immediate feelings of panic. There are plenty of people even on this sub that think the “earth will turn into a rainforest” and other ridiculous things if we keep emissions going at the rate they’re at now. 3-5*C makes me think there will be more sunny days, not the apocalypse. 

Why are we (people who believe in the preservation of the environment for the survival of humanity, if for no other reason) not focused on any of the more viscerally disturbing things that come along with climate change? They all seem like the bigger problems, and much more urgent (for lack of a better term) than the strict warming of the planet. 

- insecticide/pesticide/herbicide use & conventional ag destroying our pollinators and surrounding ecosystems 
- deforestation & development causing our water sources to dry up  
- pollution of waterways/groundwater/oceans from drilling/fracking/mining/oil spills/dirty development/ag runoff and waste mismanagement 
- pollution of our air with dirty energy generation 
- toxic chemicals pervasive in our everyday lives 
- impending collapse of wild food sources we rely on heavily to survive (ocean fish, for example) 

Any of the above seem to be way more compelling and open to far less debate/knee jerk skepticism than the hard to define, hard to “feel” (how many of us heard everyone complaining about how we “needed more global warming” during the winter cold spells?), and easy to reject/minimize “global warming.”


In short - is “global warming” a term pushed by oil companies, etc to cause us to get stuck in circular debates about the temperature while we pollute and destroy the ecosystems we rely on for survival?","2019-09-03 03:50:10","38","47","0.79","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/cyznyy/why_is_global_warming_our_biggest_focus/","True","ntalwyr","1747812775.789288","global warming myth","manual"
"d7y2uz","collapse","skeptical","Why ""nobody"" cares about climate change / global warming","Yes, people care, but many people don't *really* care. A lot of ""lip service.""

Here are some reasons...maybe you can add your own or discuss:

1. **NIML (Not in my lifetime)** \- We've been conditioned to believe that GW / CC / Earth warming, whatever, impacts would be far out into the future - for the majority of people. (Never mind all the India suicides, for example)

Only now that things are changing much faster are more people waking up, so to speak. But even then, the vast vast majority are unaware of just how fast things are moving. The 2 news stories I connect with are :

Greenland 2070 and Alaska 2069

**Do you know of any others?**

2) **Short-term thinking** \- Most people don't think in such long term cycles. Society isn't setup that way. It's very short term oriented.  Wall street is quarter to quarter. People take out 3-5 year car loans. President every 4 years. Congressman every \_\_\_\_, etc...   Even a home mortgage is 15 - 30 years. And if you are really rich, that is zero.

A book - **SHORT HISTORY OF PROGRESS** \- pretty much sums it up.

3) **Diet** \- Due to dietary habits...many people's sense of time is shorter as well - on a day to day basis. Looking at **caffeine**.

4) **Farm Disconnect** \- A small % of people grow / fish (Or rather trawl net / scoop, or what not) for most of the food (In the ""Industrialized World"" anyway). Thus...most people are disconnected from climate effects on agriculture. We are disconnected from the land - heck most people don't care or don't want to know how the meat they eat is treated.

Have you seen **DOMINION?** Did you know we absorb emotions from food we eat? FEAR has been rising....due to MALtreatment.

5) **Nature Disconnect -** Many of us live most of our lives INDOOR. Or if we are outdoors we are staring at gadgets, or what not. Or ""nature"" is a hobby, not a sense of home, so to speak. Thus - knowledge / experience with how things in nature are connected is pretty low.

Really...we are too DOMESTICATED as well.

6) **Pyramids -** If you are on the poorer end of the scale - absolutely or relatively in your area, you have less  time to worry about being eco or what-not. The richer class have more time...but these same richer classes (Generally speaking) are holding on so tight to what they have. And they want more and more. (What? I'm only in place 300 on Forbes 400! I need to crack the 200 level!) All the billionaires and mega-millionaries....greed / ego run amuck.

Thus this imbalance perpetuates the destruction. Only when we collectively stop pursuing ""wealth"" at all costs will meaningful change occur.

**THE CHARCOAL PEOPLE** is an interesting documentary to watch.

7) **Arctic What? -** Generally,you don't care about what you don't know - unless you make it a point to educate yourself about how things are related. The fact that the Arctic is warming 2x, 3x, or whatever x is irrelevant for many. So maybe Greenland 2070 doesn't mean anything.

8) **Warped Nature** \-  Ever seen a library with all of its childrens' books? Or how about cartoons? All these talking animals and fairy tale places gives many people a warped sense of nature. Even BBC documentaries as well. Maybe documentaries give a sense that nature is abundant...when in fact it is declining rapidly. And the avg viewer is unaware of just how much effort the film makers take to get their shots/video footage.

Warped nature = limited understanding / care about what is happening to the Earth / ecosystems, etc...

9) **Specialized World -** For most - the ""key to success"" is doing 1 or 2 things right in addition to your ""perceived social obligations."" But the flip side of this is that this also narrows not only our knowledge base - but our WAY OF THINKING. Thus...the current **CULT**ural setup of the world is incompatible with being flexible and broadly knowledegable. People get very specialied college degrees for example. We need more **JACKS OF ALL TRADES** \- so to speak.

Overspecialization = blindness about bigger picture.

10) **Happy Endings** \- There is a collective FANtasy that craves happy endings. You see it movies, TV shows, religion (Heaven!), etc...so if many people are conditioned that ""everything"" will work out, they pay less attention perhaps to the current events / warning signs. Books/movies that have unhappy or ambiguous endings - how well do those do?

Global Warming / Climate change is a big dose of unhappiness so to speak. So people ignore it.....more / less. Or make token gestures.

So...until people are personally affected in a huge way...the situation will persist. Collectively need to self-reflect. But, by the time that fully happens...the situation will already be quite ugly. And for many - no time to self-reflect, just survival (See Abaco, Bahamas, etc...)

on this note..I'll say...**sometimes you gotta hit rock bottom before you can go up.**
