Anyone can cherry pick statistics to fit their narrative and that is precisely what Mr. Baum does in this paper here. Furthermore, he makes patently false statements which fly in the face of general observation, like his statement here:

>The hockey stick graph was published, and was the main evidence, and the surface based temperature series showed the earth had been warming for more than 20 years. But since then, the hockey stick was invalidated, and the earth has stayed flat or cooled.

Not only was it incorrect to say this single graph was 'the main evidence', but it is also incorrect to state 'the earth has stayed flat or cooled'. So this man is publishing falsehoods in order to drive a narrative. 

Its no wonder he looks to shills like Lindzen for his references. ","2016-12-15 20:04:58","7","philosarapter","1747770271.340611","global warming myth","manual"

If you see anything on Baum's Gish Gallop list from 2010 that is not answered a thousand times over and over again on the internet and made it on the [list of climate myths](https://skepticalscience.com/argument.php) do ask for a more detailed question, rather than expecting other people to do all the work for you.","2016-12-15 20:00:41","5","VictorVenema","1747770271.344125","global warming myth","manual"
