"76guhu","climatechange","action-oriented","I'm having a casual debate with someone who doesn't believe global warming is an issue. Need some suggestions.","First off, I'm coming from an unbiased position. I've never really ever researched or payed attention to this topic much before, but I'm about to participate in a casual debate on the subject. I know that there are two sides to the issue of climate change, and I'm trying to come up with a resolution that most reflects that debate without exactly *knowing* what the debate is yet, due to my lack of knowledge. Both sides, from what I gather, agree on the increase in temperature and emissions and things like that, so I figured the real debate must reside in whether this is an issue or not. With that in mind, I was considering this resolution: ""Is climate change a crisis (or issue)."" If this isn't the focal point of the debate, I'd like some suggestions for a better resolution that reflects the disagreement better. 

As I will be taking the side that asserts that climate change is a dire problem that needs to be dealt with (again, assuming that's the resolution I'm going with), I could also use some good sources and articles that I could use to support my case. 

Thanks for any help that you have to offer!","2017-10-15 03:54:36","8","69","0.84","https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/76guhu/im_having_a_casual_debate_with_someone_who_doesnt/","True","Wabbbit7","1747783325.44896","global warming myth","manual"
