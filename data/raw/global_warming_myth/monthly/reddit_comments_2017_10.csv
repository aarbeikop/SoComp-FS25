"dofap9e","t3_76guhu","76guhu","climatechange","action-oriented","Alright. Here are the very basics, in bullet point form for brevity:

- CO2 is a greenhouse gas, meaning that increasing the amount in the atmosphere will increase global temperatures, all else being equal.

- It is one of several greenhouse gases. The one that accounts for most of the greenhouse effect is water vapor. That's important to know, for a reason that we'll come back to later.

- The direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2 is an increase in temperature of about 1.1°C, but that doesn't include feedbacks. *There is broad agreement on this, even among skeptics.*

- There are positive and negative feedbacks. A positive feedback is one that amplifies a given change in temperature and a negative feedback is one that dampens the change. There are thousands of feedbacks in the climate system.

- When feedbacks are factored in, the resulting temperature change is referred to as ""climate sensitivity."" There are two kinds of climate sensitivity discussed in AR5, the IPCC's fifth and most recent assessment report: ECS and TCR.

- ECS stands for equilibrium climate sensitivity. This is the amount of warming per doubling of CO2 that you get once all the feedbacks have had time to settle in. It's important to note that it takes *decades or even centuries *to reach equilibrium once a doubling is reached.

- TCR stands for transient climate response. This is the amount of warming expected while CO2 is rising and at the time that a doubling is reached.

- Preindustrial CO2 was about 280 parts per million (ppm), so a doubling would be 560 ppm.

- Present CO2 levels are about 400 ppm.

- Future CO2 concentrations will depend on lots of things like population growth, CO2 emissions per capita, natural carbon sinks, etc. My own best guess is that we won't reach 560 ppm until near the end of the century.

- Producing a value for either type of climate sensitivity is really, really hard. AR5 listed the likely range as 1.5-4.5°C per doubling. That's the same range as was first proposed in the 70s or 80s. It's been really difficult to narrow it down because the climate system is chaotic and extremely complex. 

The debate lies not in the basics of CO2 being a greenhouse gas or human contributions to atmospheric CO2, but in feedbacks. If you are going to assert that climate change is a dire problem, understand that the weak part of that position lies in uncertainty around feedbacks.","2017-10-16 01:39:40","7","Will_Power","1747783327.232252","global warming myth","manual"

1. CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  This is an easy experimental question to answer, and had been known for more than 100 years.

2. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere had been increasing for as long as we have been measuring it directly (in the 1950's).

3. Humans are responsible for the additional show in the atmosphere (card, electricity).  

These  three FACTS are irrefutable and easy to understand, leaning only one side, as others have said.

Then there are the predictions , compared to reality.  In 1965, the US government received a report predicting increased global temperature. In the 70's the oil industry predicted the same.  In the 80's we got the hockey stick chart that made some pretty detailed predictions, that were pretty accurate, when adjusted for volcanic activity.

Whether climate change is a crisis it's not depends on your perspective.  As a rich American in the north east, it just means milder winters, long growing seasons and more hour days (air conditioners to the rescue).

If more, powerful hurricanes, flooding in many of the world's coastal cities, hotter, dryer areas around tree world and the possibility of civil unrest and possibly civil war in 80 years don't matter to you, because you are dead, and the loss of habitat and discuss aren't a problem because you don't worry you, then no problem.

Unless those civil wars cause the collapse of civilization altogether, which would suck for all.","2017-10-15 23:32:37","2","TaleSlinger","1747783327.2365718","global warming myth","manual"

As the sea ice and snow in the Arctic melt this exposes darker water and plants. Ice that reflects 80% of the energy back out to space becomes a darker ocean which absorbs 80% of the incoming energy.  The loss of this reflective cap at the top of the world will add another 50% increase to the radiative forcing caused by our emissions. At some point this becomes a runaway feedback.

"doef2uu","t3_76guhu","76guhu","climatechange","action-oriented","Lets assume it's as bad as they say it is.  It still wouldn't matter because the cost of stopping climate change would essentially end mankind anyways.

The various economics reports estimate +1 to -3% GDP cost per year by 2100.  This is on par with the current cost of metal corrosion. The cost of ""stopping"" climate change would essentially require a global collapse of civilization as we know it.

Here is my copy pasta I made explaining the situation.

----------------------------

Using the IPCC's own calculations, I will show that the policy recommendations to ""stop"" climate change are insane.

- The IPCC figured a 5% cut in emissions when Australia implemented it's carbon tax by 2020. (the largest and most ambitious plan implemented to date) [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_pricing_in_Australia#History) [source2](http://www.garnautreview.org.au/update-2011/garnaut-review-2011/garnaut-review-2011.pdf)

- 100% of Australia's emissions are 1.2% of global emissions.

- The 5% cut of Australia's global amount of 1.2% is 0.07% of total global emissions.

- IPCC figures Co2 will be 410ppm by 2020

- 0.07% of 410 is ~409.988 ppm...      (co2 rises ~ 2ppm per year, figured a 0.07% cut over 9 years, or (410 -((9*2) * 0.0007))) = 409.9874 ppm

- IPCC equation for Co2 forcing is (5.35 * ln(current Co2 / revised Co2 )) or (5.35 * ln(410/409.988)) [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing#Forcing_due_to_atmospheric_gas)

- (5.35 * ln(410 / (410 +((9*2) * 0.0007)))) = 0.00016441716 w/m2 of reduced forcing

- Climate sensitivity parameter is simple the change in temperature per w/m2 increase. In other words, the actual change in temp divided by the change in energy 'imbalance' since the start of the industrial revolution(150 years).  Accounting for El Nino it's risen ~ 0.7-0.8 K over the last 150 years, but lets just say 1 C.  

- (5.35 * ln(400 / 280)) = 1.90821095007 w/m2

- 1 C / 1.90821095007 = 0.52 K per w/m2 (PS, This number is unlikely to rise because it's derived from a natural logarithm, thus will asymptotically approach zero as Co2 concentrations rise)

- Then figure the climate sensitivity parameter of 0.52(0.00016) and you get 0.0000832 C reduction in global temperatures.

Read that again... it's 1:12,000th of a single degree Celsius.

Now... for the kicker... The IPCC estimated it would cost Australia 160 billion dollars over the 10 year carbon tax plan to get 0.00016 w/m2 of reduced forcing.. [source, 2011 Garnaut Report, 11.2 billion per year tax, plus other indirect costs](http://www.garnautreview.org.au/update-2011/garnaut-review-2011/garnaut-review-2011.pdf)

**To save a full degree Celsius of warming, based on the IPCC's own math on the Australian carbon tax plan, would cost 3.2 quadrillion dollars.... or 43 times total global GDP.**

Does climate change really matter if the only realistic solution is an economic apocalypse?

According the the stern report(the biggest economic study ever done on climate economics, by the Royal Society of the UK), global costs, under a worst case(nothing done) scenario are expected to be ~ 5% of GDP per year. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review

That means that if the costs of a carbon tax costs the average person more then 5% per year, then it is not worth it. Given that emissions are basically synonymous with GDP, a 5% cut in emissions would have an impact on temperatures literally too small to measure, but huge economic ramifications.

To use the above math on how long it would take to achieve a single C drop in temps spending 5% of global GDP on it.


- (5.35 * ln(400 / (400+ (20 * 0.05)))) = -0.01335830906 w/m2 (co2 rises ~ 2ppm per year, figured a 5% cut over 10 years, or **400 +(20 * 0.05)**)

- (0.52) * -0.01335830906 = -0.00694632071 K

- 1/0.00694632071 =  143.96 * 10 = 1440 YEARS

Well fuck.  1440 years to mitigate a single degree C at 5% GDP cost(3.5 trillion per year).  How many star systems can we colonize before then? 

**So you are stuck in a paradox. Either you drastically lower the average living standard to a level far worse then climate change would ever cause, or cut emissions to a level that would have no discernible impact on global temperatures.** In either case, it makes no sense.

You can argue about the plants and animals... But I can guarantee that any cut that is forced on people strong enough to have a measurable impact... would cause an economic apocalypse large enough to cause widespread environmental destruction. Starving people will burn the forests for energy and hunt everything to extinction, in order to survive.

To end this... Nuclear power is the only realistically viable path to disconnecting the carbon emission = GDP connection, But It's not ""deniers"" stopping the nuclear revolution... it's environmentalists.","2017-10-15 15:25:02","0","FireFoxG","1747783327.248717","global warming myth","manual"
