> **Elephant in the living room** is an English metaphorical idiom for an obvious truth that is going unaddressed. The idiomatic expression also applies to an obvious problem or risk no one wants to discuss.

Originally, this saying alluded to a stuffed elephant, a most imposing display of taxidermy, but a living, active beast is more pertinent to this post. First, here is a fable.

>The USA now contains many living rooms with dimensions adequate to house an elephant, and so, in lieu of keeping a hundred housecats, one American eccentric acquired a baby elephant as a pet. At first, he kept it in his exurban backyard, but when winter came, he sheltered it within his living room. Alas, the pachyderm soon grew too large to exit the doorway, but the eccentric resolved to continue raising the elephant indoors. At great sacrifice, he provided it with fodder and water, and even managed its colossal wastes.

(On a visit to a zoo, I once observed a rhinoceros urinating. The tremendous stream lasted for what seemed two or more minutes. Flooding the muddy paddock, the urine overflowed beyond the fence and displaced the amazed onlookers from the sidewalk. These magnificent creatures will soon be extinct, because some East Asian men believe a powder made from their horns is a miraculous aphrodisiac.)

>The elephant survived for many years, long enough to attain its full size, and this considerable accomplishment pleased its keeper, even made him proud. Then one day, by accident or from a brief tantrum, the confined beast crushed its keeper against an interior wall. Soon thereafter, only death occupied the living room.

Over seven billion of us are now trampling this planet to its death, and yet most of us studiously deny this stark fact. Reviewing two recent books (both published in 2013) is to explore this denial of Overpopulation.

The first is Alan Weisman’s *Countdown*(2013).

>If we wanted to bring about the extinction of the human race as quickly as possible, how might we proceed?

> … the most effective measure, counterintuitive as it may be, would be to increase our numbers. Population is what economists call a multiplier. The more people, the greater the likelihood of ecological collapse, nuclear war, plague.

This book greatly impressed me. While you might gather the gist of its message by reading a dozen news articles, that would be no substitute for Weisman’s well-crafted narrative. The NYT review provides an overview of the book, but I will focus on Weisman’s exposition of ‘Overpopulation Denial’.

Weisman takes the reader on a journey both through the hotspots of global population growth and to nations now in demographic decline. Like any effective narrator, Weisman offers us heroes and villains, often through first-person interviews. His heroes are those who have acted to curb population growth – Weisman’s review of the origins of China’s One Child Policy and the highly effective birth control program permitted by the Islamic Republic of Iran (unexpected!) are of particular interest. Also of note is his rehabilitation of the reputation of Paul Erhlich, the often discredited author of *The Population Bomb*(1968). That Ehrlich’s prophecy of mass famine and collapse was premature (so far, by a half century) should be a cautionary example for all of us doomsayers; the Bible and Nostradamus have long remained in vogue *precisely because* they offered no timeline for their obscure predictions.

Weisman’s villains were obvious to cast, and can be grouped as three overlapping circles in a Venn diagram.

First, there are those who are *opposed to all population control* for religious reasons: the Catholic Church, Islamic mullahs, and American Protestant fundamentalists. Label this circle as the Superstitious. From the inception of Agriculture and into the Industrial Revolution, Civilization was under constant threat from famine, infectious disease and war, but an extreme fertility could compensate for this high mortality, allowing the global population its slow and erratic growth. This was the Malthusian Age, and the Superstitious came to dominate it by promoting the belief that human suffering had a divine justification. They continue to promote ‘be fruitful and multiply’ and defend this now calamitous strategy by promising there will be room enough for all in the Eternal Afterlife. However, all that the First Circle has guaranteed us is a short residence on a jam packed Hell on Earth.

It was a Christian Reverend, Thomas Malthus, who first clearly formulated the principal driver of Evolution – organisms tend to multiply beyond the bounds of what they need to exist – but the greater irony is that Malthus arrived at the this conclusion just as Malthusian conditions were entering a great pause. During Industrialization, the Second Circle formed and it consists of reckless Expansionists.

Economic gain is the prime motivator of the Expansionists, so they take economists as their high priests. As articles of faith, the Second Circle holds that resources are essentially infinite and so, the larger the population, the greater are the means of extracting these ever-abundant resources. Virtually all economists believe some variation of this lunacy – it is of special note that Marx and Engels were among the most vociferous opponents of Thomas Malthus and his theory. Among the Expansionists, I also encircle the prolific African polygamists and ethnic nationalists (Israelis vs. Palestinians) that Weisman examines, as they too breed in hope of secular gains.

However, this is a Venn diagram, and here we have a recent example of the overlap between the First and Second Circles.

>Family planning not for Muslims, says Turkey's Erdogan

>In 2014, he described birth control as a ""treason"" which risked causing a whole generation to ""dry up"".

>And he has famously urged mothers to have four children, saying: ""one (child) means loneliness, two means rivalry, three means balance and four means abundance.""

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/family-planning-not-muslims-says-turkeys-erdogan-001816630.html

From this brief article it is apparent that President Erdogan’s aims are simultaneously nationalistic and religious, economic and political. Here is another clear example of mixed motivations in Population Denial, spoken in a short YouTube clip by Michelle Duggar, a ‘very Christian’ American woman who has attained a lucrative national celebrity through the birthing of nineteen living children.

https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=Michelle+duggar+on+overpopulation&&view=detail&mid=22B068E72847220227F022B068E72847220227F0&FORM=VRDGAR

Note that she makes little mention of her faith and instead employs some standard talking points from the Second Circle.

The Superstitious find Overpopulation to be irrelevant. The Expansionists deny it can be a problem. The Third Circle holds those who brought the Elephant into the Living Room and yet now declare speaking of it to be taboo. This final category of villains are the *Humanitarians*.

To be fair, Weisman was not as explicit in describing this Third Circle, but his recounting of the stark contrast in the public fates of Paul Ehrlich and Norman Borlaug does suggest it. The premature prophet of Overpopulation remains a subject of ridicule, while Wikipedia describes Borlaug as

> ...an American biologist, humanitarian and Nobel laureate who has been called ""the father of the Green Revolution"", ""agriculture's greatest spokesperson"" and ""The Man Who Saved A Billion Lives"". He is one of seven people to have won the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal and was also awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian honor.

From *Countdown*, I gathered that Borlaug is the originator of the most colossal and catastrophic Ponzi scheme possible: More feeding could only increase human breeding. That is one contradiction in the Humanitarian Project. Here are a few other:

- For Humanitarians, ecological devastation is secondary to the needs of the global poor. They claim the greater problem is the overconsumption of resources by the developed world – a valid point and one that the fecund Michelle Duggar echoes in her YouTube clip. However, *Countdown* illustrates that billions of peasants, by the practice of farming or collecting firewood or fishing coral reefs with explosives and cyanide, are also a sure pathway to Eco-catastrophe, and not much of a longer route at that.

- Humanitarians believe that family planning should never be coercive, but while voluntary, grassroots programs have made considerable strides in Latin America and Iran, this Demographic Transition has been slow in coming to much of Africa, South Asia and the Islamic world. Our current population is already far beyond its sustainable limits and must undergo a sharp and quick reduction – this can be either coerced or it will be*spontaneous*. It is of note that without the One Child Policy, there might be an additional 400 million Chinese consumers burning coal and desiring rhinoceros horns.

- The Demographic Transition depends on increases in education and employment (especially for women), better healthcare, extensive urbanization and infrastructure development: That is, the Demographic Transition works by promoting entry into the *middle class*, which we define by a vast increase in resource consumption. The Demographic Transition of the Developing World can only accelerate the devastation of the Biosphere, and the approaching extinction of most creatures with a backbone.

[See the most recent posts by Ugo Bardi on his *Cassandra’s Legacy* blog for some concurrence with these themes.]

The motivations of the Humanitarians overlap the other Circles of Overpopulation Hell. Their ethics are typically secularized versions of religious ones, a stripped down, free-floating empathy. Humanitarian institutions are largely subservient to the interests of the Expansionists, often little more than tax-evading vehicles meant to massage obscenely wealthy egos. When a Humanitarian offers up a ‘win-win formula’, it is typically a hustle for his own profit. The professional reviewer of *Countdown* concludes:

> But the book’s most indelible image comes from Weisman’s visit to Japan, where the fertility rate is so low — 1.4 children per female — that the population has been declining since 2006. This might make Japan something of a best-case situation, but an aging population means there are too many senior citizens, and not enough young people to take care of them.

Weisman offers Japan as a possible model for his Countdown, a voluntary decision to decrease our unsustainable numbers, but the reviewer seems more concerned about a threat to his comfortable retirement than an expiring Biosphere. The governments of Iran and China now agree with him and they have begun efforts to reverse the hard-won, stabilizing trend of their demography. More will be the pity.

Few intellectuals are willing to venture outside of the approved thought of the Three Circles, but Stephen J. Emmott is another courageous soul, the author of my second reviewed book, *Ten Billion*.

> … a Professor and Head of Computational Science at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK, where he has worked since 2004. He is also a Visiting Professor at University College London and the University of Oxford.

From the back cover

> … a scientist whose lab is at the forefront of research into complex natural systems, sounds the alarm.

A strident alarm it is indeed – the slim paperback displays its title in Threat Level Orange on a black background. On its 216 pages is no more text than found in a lengthy magazine article; typically, each of its pages holds only a short paragraph or even a single sentence. Interspersed through this sparse text are about a dozen graphs and a few symbolic photographs. Reading it, I realized it was not so much a book as a Power Point presentation. I am fanatic for notes and references, (not only for verification, but also as leads to additional sources) and this author provided me *not one citation*, which is especially galling as some of his statistics and projections seemed doubtful. Still, on reflection, I found it an admirable template for a literary call-to-action, an example of agitprop made effective because at its core, it is very much the Truth.

I went to the *Guardian* for a review of Emmott’s book. The reviewer slammed it.

> Stephen Emmott's population book is unscientific and misanthropic

> 'Ten billion' book by Microsoft scientist is error-strewn, full of exaggeration and weak on basic science, says Chris Goodall [Ouch!]

http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/09/stephen-emmott-population-book-misanthropic

In the first paragraph, I found his description of the format of Emmott’s book was nearly identical to the one I give above, a pure convergence of critique. However, what follows from Goodall is a complete refutation of the book’s thesis (that this Civilization is doomed), with an appendix of several screen pages detailing errors the reviewer found in the book.

Yet, I still support the book, finding any fuzziness to be irrelevant to Emmott’s unimpeachable message.

> Very strangely, I don't think any of the thirteen apocalyptic charts in his book are taken from primary sources. [Goodall]

I know I could pull a hundred and thirty well-sourced ‘apocalyptic charts’ to replace or supplement those of Emmott. All of them, charts of dire exponential trends driven by population growth. Hockey stick graphs, *only I now see the shapes of scythes in them*, the tool to be deployed by the approaching Grim Reaper. I also wonder how many of Goodall’s ‘findings of error’ can be disputed. For example

> Reasonable 2050 predictions are almost all in the 9 to 10 billion range, with most people seeing declines after that date but he tells us that we might actually see 28 billion by 2100. Does he have an argument why his number could be right? No, he just asserts it. [Goodall]

Here is a recent link that cites that same projection.

> The UN's latest median world population projection of 11.2 billion by 2100 is predicated on continuing reductions in fertility rate, he adds. Without them, the constant fertility variant projects to roughly 28 billion by 2100.

http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-05/b-euv052716.php

That high projection is horrifying – if it were possible. Apart from any legitimate contention of facts, what is striking is that Goodall’s review of *Ten Billion* verges on hysteria. Why is that?

>Chris Goodall is a businessman, author and climate change expert. He is the author of **Ten Technologies to Save the Planet**.

Goodall is both a Humanitarian and an Expansionist, a well-meaning fellow who is also trying to turn an extra buck or euro from his good works. Contrast that worldview with this statement from Emmott, composed on a single stark page.

> The green revolution was not a story about ‘clever people who worked out how to get more food from our fields.’ The truth is that the green revolution was a story about clever people thinking it was a good idea to buy every extra unit of food through energy and chemicals. [pg.181]

If I agree with that, am I also a Misanthrope?

In E. O. Wilson’s *Half Earth*, he found Emmott’s book fit to list as a source for further reading, and unlike Goodall and myself, Wilson is a scientific giant. Maybe he too knows a good piece of agitprop when he sees it. After I had written most of the bits and pieces of this too long post, I discovered that Goodall’s derisive review was published as a rebuttal to a prior *Guardian* review of Emmott’s book, one that was extremely favorable to it.

> Population 10 Billion by Danny Dorling and Ten Billion by Stephen Emmott – review

> Are we done for? John Gray on one flawed and one indispensable study of population growth

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/05/ten-billion-stephen-emmott-review

The author of this review is the redoubtable British public intellectual, John Gray. He compares and contrasts Emmott’s book with a book by a denying Humanitarian. Do read his concise piece, which I found myself in synchrony with – and embarrassingly so. John Grey anticipated (and exceeds) most of my conclusions about motivations of the deniers (though the Venn diagram is my own gimmick). Reading his article, I had the same feeling as when working the simplest odd-numbered problems in a school text, then turning to the back to check the answers – I was slightly encouraged.

Gray’s review prompted me to read *Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals*, his fabulous philosophical treatise on human nature (2002), and finishing it yesterday, I was encouraged to complete this self-indulgent post. *Straw Dogs* is a relentless assault against the mindset that links the Three Circles of my Venn diagram, a philosophical delusion that Gray terms as ‘Humanism’.

>Humanism is secular religion thrown together from decaying scraps of Christian myth. [pg. 31]

>History is a treadmill turned by rising human numbers. [pg. 158]

I end by returning to Alan Weisman’s *Countdown* and his proposal, a plea, for a voluntarily reduction of the Earth’s human population. Each year, the human population is adding 80 million new, net members to its total. This despite the great strides made:

> family planning in developing countries prevents 55 million unintended births [per year].

>…75 percent of the sexually active women in the developing world who aren’t trying to get pregnant over the next two years (meaning they are either spacing pregnancies or avoiding them altogether) are already using contraceptives. [Weisman]

If all of these women had access to birth control, an additional 21 million unintended births would be prevented, the equivalent of *not adding* another Beijing each year (or almost five Harris County USA, where I reside). The population mathematician Joel Cohen estimates that 

>…just a half-child-per-woman in the world’s fertility rate… could bring us back down to 6 billion by the end of the century – or half a child in the other direction could take us to 16 billion.

My estimation, my belief, is that even the most hopeful outcome of the *Countdown* scenario would still be far too little, far too late.

Following an account of the difficulties that wildlife agents encountered in trying to manage the deer population of the Kaibab Plateau in Arizona, Weisman concluded his book with this:

>I don’t want to cull anyone alive today. I wish every human now on the planet a long, healthy life. But either we take control ourselves, and humanely bring our numbers down by recruiting fewer new members of the human race to take our places, or nature is going to hand out a pile of pink slips. When you see survival of the fittest portrayed on the National Geographic Channel, it’s entertaining. When it happens to your species, it’s not pretty.

More bluntly, page 216 of Stephen Emmott’s*Ten Billion* holds:

>We urgently need to do –and I mean *actually* do – something radical to avert global catastrophe. But I don’t think we will.

>I think we’re fucked.

Weisman seems to be a compassionate person, but he is also the author of a prior book, *The World Without Us* (2009). That one examines how the Biosphere would recover in the total absence of our species – if Humanity were to vanish in some Green Rapture. The pages of the *Guardian* have declared Emmott to be a misanthrope. To some intense criticism, E. O. Wilson now advocates returning half of this planet back to Nature, and keeping that half largely devoid of people. What exactly does the title of John Gray’s anti-Humanist tract mean?

>In ancient Chinese rituals, straw dogs were used as offerings to the gods. During the ritual they were treated with the utmost reverence. When it was over and they were no longer needed they were trampled on and tossed aside: ‘Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad of creatures as straw dogs.’ [pgs.33-34]

These thoughts come from intellects that are outliers to the prevailing Venn diagram, stray dots beyond the interlinked Three Circles of Humanism. If from future *necessity* enough stray dots should collect into their own Dark Circles and embark on programs to meet the coming catastrophe and survive it, what label should we apply to them? Anti-Humanitarians or perhaps, Inhumanists who seek to cull before being culled?
