"852ve9","climatechange","action-oriented","Odds that anthropogenic global warming will result in a global catastrophe.","I'm using the attached scale as an arbitrary frame of reference. The lowest level of global catastrophe indicated is something along the lines of a 1km diameter asteroid striking the earth, impacting billions while also leaving billions of survivors. 

http://lesswrong.com/lw/n48/levels_of_global_catastrophes_from_mild_to/

I ask this to try and get a feel for this subreddit's feel for tolerance and risk management and try to iterate to some common understanding of how we categorize outcomes. 

From an extreme standpoint, I'm beginning with the perspective that life on earth will inevitably come to an end in a few billions years maximum as a result of the sun's life cycle. It's not so much if human's will meet their demise, but when. That said, I'll argue with a bias in favor of human longevity as measured by (pop. size * life span * potential future generations). It's an arbitrary starting point. 

Based upon the information available to me, my gut feel is that the odds of a global catastrophe are ~ 40%. I am very bullish about technological innovation that will dramatically reduce the need to burn fossil fuels. I'm guessing that we are no more than 10-15 years from peak voluntary emissions. 

On the downside, I'm concerned about the inertia we've already introduced into the system, additional inputs in the coming decades and the time we have to adapt. 

Economic dislocation due to loss of fossil fuel revenues will be tremendous. The likelihood of extreme coastal real estate losses (many times the severity of the 2008 financial crisis) is very high and timing of these losses will be paramount in determining the severity of the outcome. Due to subsidence and limestone geography, I think areas like N. Orleans and S. Florida are already destined to be toast.  

In a scenario in which hundreds of millions of people need to migrate and agricultural capacity declines, the ability to govern becomes trickier and we could experience a more profound catastrophe. I'll put that at 10%. 

There are enough unknowns here that I'll begin with the assumption that none of us has a crystal ball to the future. I hope this will frame a robust discussion of the SCIENCE that informs us of the risks.
