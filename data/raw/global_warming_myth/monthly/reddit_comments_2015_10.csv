All college majors are finding jobs in RE and related industries (EVs, smart grid, etc).  So, pick a major that really interests you, ideally one that comes to you naturally.  RE companies hire more college grads who have engineering and quantitative majors (around 70% of our job listings), but the remaining 30% translates to a very large number of jobs in business (finance, marketing, sales, environmental science and economics/policy.  Since you are a freshman, I would postpone thinking a lot about grad school for now, and besides, many if not most grad school students work a few years before grad school so there is plenty of time to make that choice in the future.  You may want to think seriously about job roles/titles that interest you.  What do you think you would like to do, specifically, such as, design things, make them, do research, sell, analyze data, manage people, etc.  These are hard questions for a freshman but they are important questions and they apply as much to RE as they do any other industry.  Happy to continue the discussion.","2015-10-24 03:35:17","1","Dayawaycareers","1747757982.141393","global warming myth","manual"
