The momentum of my interest was watching ""The Unconvenient Truth"" made by Al Gore, and reading books about Elon Musk.

I now study at Kyungpook National University at Daegu, South Korea majoring in Business management.
I really want to work at Tesla, Solarcity in reference to my interest. Or some other companies that are related to the renewable energy and green-cars.

But for me right now, I've got no idea what I have to choice, do, and make efforts on. To be honest, I have no idea what I should do to enter the companies in the related areas. Plus I want to work especially in planning fields.
Whether I should study some fields related to the energy, engineerings? Can just learning about business management and getting a license related to financing and accounting help me find a job in the related fields?

Till now I just polished up English skills(with toeic 900s) , and tried to read books related to the fields of these renewable energy and the seriousness of environmental problems. Plus I tried to watch every video of Elon Musk.
I don't have much expertise in science and mathematics. Should I move my major to related fields? (Cf. in Korean high school educational systems, we have to make a choice whether to study liberal arts or natural science in grade 1 high school. I chose liberal arts and have no basic expertise in science and mathematics.

I just thought of my life in several ways. First choice would be studying Korean SAT in natural science version as to get expertise in science and mathematics, and go to a major which will be related to renewable energy or green-car(There are majors in Korean
universities that are called Green- Car major , renewable energy major)

Secondly, whether I should now try to study abroad in America. As there are much more universities and companies that are really related to these fields.
Third, I can do a double case study. My university has a major called energy engineering major.

Lastly, looking further and going to a graduate school. This year one of my seniors in the same major, university went to University of Pennsylvania where Elon Musk graduated
These are the four choices which I thought.

Also I want to ask although I just had the degree of business management, is it possible to work in companies related to REs and car companies.

Can you give me some advice? I have the passion to work in these areas but want to make the object clear right now to go for. Thank you.","2015-10-24 02:09:20","2","1","0.67","https://www.reddit.com/r/Renewable/comments/3pzgdt/careers_interested_in_renewable_energy_and/","True","green_ht","1747757981.358539","global warming myth","manual"
