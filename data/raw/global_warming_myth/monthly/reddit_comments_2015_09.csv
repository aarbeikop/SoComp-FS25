Their conclusion was that climate is cyclical with short term events like eruptions and ENSO acting to modify climate patterns. 

Today's numerous climate scientists like to claim that they can tease the very weak CO2 signal in paleo reconstructions from the noise which increases as one moves back in time. I'll grant that the methods used to create paleo reconstructions have improved greatly over a short period of time. Exotic statistical methods are still needed to arrive at even a weak signal. Meanwhile, direct analysis of plant material tells a robust story of extreme climate swings that make present the present day seem a marvel of stability.

ENSO has only been studied since 1950  [Here is a link to a quick ENSO chart.](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/) Note that La Nina dominated in the period before warming set in ~1975. It's presumed from the general evidence of wind and rain patterns that El Nino dominated prior to ~1950. Since ~1975 El Nino has once again dominated, and for a longer period than the previous dominance (from general evidence).

That brings us to your original question.  Due to a lack of data we can't know how ENSO will behave. ENSO is thought to be a symptom of a greater pattern called the PDO. Nobody even noticed the PDO until 1997. My own thought on the issue is that as we go through a greater warm cycle of a few centuries El Nino periods will come to dominate over more lengthy periods. The shorter La Nina periods may become more violent or more quiescent; there's no way *I*, or anyone, can say due to the lack of data.","2015-09-03 15:57:22","1","OortCloud","1747756549.819602","global warming myth","manual"

The same people make the same less sustainable claims all the time, slowly moving goalposts one way and another to attempt to keep the matter in doubt.  There is no real controversy about what is happening with the weather overall.  AGW by GHG forcing is the dominant factor in climate changes we are witnessing persisting through the natural variability.  The natural variabilities are complicating not obscuring matters.  The history of AGW science denial is one of deception and obfustication not of investigation.

One miracle cure after another is announced, disproven and discarded then resuscitated, given a new coat of paint and announced again.","2015-09-04 00:13:49","1","Long_dan","1747756549.82301","global warming myth","manual"

It would be best to refer to a brief summary in the most recent IPCC report:

>There is high confidence that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical Pacific, with global effects in the 21st century. Due to the increase in moisture availability, ENSO- related precipitation variability on regional scales will likely intensify. Natural variations of the amplitude and spatial pattern of ENSO are large and thus confidence in any specific projected change in ENSO and related regional phenomena for the 21st century remains low. {5.4, 14.4}

So, large uncertainty remains about the effects of anthropogenic factors on El Niño as a phenomenon. Some theoretical and modelling work suggests increased frequency and/or intensity, but no consensus.

What is pretty clear is that, even if the fundamentals of El Niño don't change, its regional effects will be intensified - droughts, floods, storms etc.","2015-09-04 09:31:09","1","skeeezoid","1747756549.827008","global warming myth","manual"
