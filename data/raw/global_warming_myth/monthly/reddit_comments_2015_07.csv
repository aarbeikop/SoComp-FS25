A collapse of civilization would entail an inability to safely decommission these plants and would lead to runaway meltdowns.  There are 99 reactors in the US alone and each of these could contaminate an area of hundreds of square miles making it deadly to enter an area that is strewn with radioactive particles.","2015-07-10 22:46:49","3","anonymous_212","1747755040.893924","global warming myth","manual"
"ct7o3f9","t3_3dq44n","3dq44n","collapse","skeptical","Right on. The dogmatic certainty that we'll tech our way into an even better energy paradigm because ""humans are skilled adapters"" is absurd to me. If we're not adapting *now* then we're going to have to bootstrap, and the futurist types you're talking about just don't seem to understand compounding complexities and the inherent vulnerabilities. For them, somehow, complexity is strength. The bigger the tower is, the less likely it is to fall! I think it is some kind of viral perversion of concepts like biodiversity. I don't know if there is any singular cause(maybe just basic greed and ignorance), but the cultural programming and other factors you allude to sure don't help.

Please someone convince me otherwise.","2015-07-19 00:43:54","7","[deleted]","1747755072.129908","global warming myth","manual"
"ct86ude","t3_3dq44n","3dq44n","collapse","skeptical","Good post.  We all have to believe in something, I guess tech is one of the betting things to believe in.

However,  I believe humans lack the ability to figure this problem out and that were all fucked so the second thing I believe in is drinking...***heavily***.

Cheers!","2015-07-19 00:42:24","5","[deleted]","1747755072.1316538","global warming myth","manual"
"ct80ils","t3_3dq44n","3dq44n","collapse","skeptical","I think the problem with technology, is that it tends to build on top of other technology and also requires more energy to maintain. Add to that the blind faith that technology will fix all, which is deeply disturbing.

Now technological innovation can help us, just not that type that relies on additional energy, or existing technology and thus the energy and fragility that comes with it. ","2015-07-18 21:03:02","3","[deleted]","1747755072.133099","global warming myth","manual"
