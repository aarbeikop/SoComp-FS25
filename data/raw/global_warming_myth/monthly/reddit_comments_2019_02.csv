"eh9sx9b","t3_auixk9","auixk9","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","Also Margaret Thatcher was one of the first politicians to openly speak about climate change and she was a conservative. I do not fit under any umbrella, if I HAD to pick, I'd be liberal, but every issue needs analysis on it's own. Blindly following a team and siding what the majority say no matter what, like it's your home football team, is just stupid no matter which side you are on.

Conserving the environment we have thrived in is something the conservatives should do, right? I'm surprised they don't see it that way. Their name is severely misleading to me. ","2019-02-25 21:02:31","3","[deleted]","1747798836.279294","global warming myth","manual"

"ehawrns","t3_auixk9","auixk9","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","I weep when I think that Conservative used to mean Conservation.  


Teddy Roosevelt created the national parks.  


Richard Nixon helped create the EPA.  


William Ruckleshaus was the first administrator of that agency, and was ruthlessly effective at his job.  


Barry Goldwater even supported environmental causes and worked to expand national parks.  


There is room for Conservatism in Climate and Environmental circles - there is no room for denial of reality. I for one say 'Welcome! We're so glad you are finally here!'","2019-02-26 05:32:50","2","WaywardPatriot","1747798836.283068","global warming myth","manual"
