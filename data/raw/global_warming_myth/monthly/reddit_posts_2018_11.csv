"9xr9rw","collapse","skeptical","Last two South Park episodes revive ""ManBearPig,"" a character who used to make fun of Al Gore and those who warn of global warming, but now the creators show ManBearPig is a real threat","In the newest episodes of South Park, it is revealed that the older generation in South Park made a deal with MBP, in which they received ""cars and boutique ice cream"" on the condition that MBP will return in 50 years and wreak havoc on the town ""100 fold"".   
This clearly was a metaphor for unbridled use of fossil fuels.     
Initially, Stan and the other children try to broker a new deal by giving up these goods (clearly a metaphor that we have to give up some luxuries in order to even get close to addressing the threat of climate change) but eventually, they make a deal to keep all their goods and in exchange, ""MBP gets the rights to the lives of all children in third world countries and will return in 5 years to wreak damage upon the town 1000 fold,"" indicating a rather nihilistic, but probably realistic view of the creators of SP that the developed nations will never agree to do enough to adequately address climate change, and they will suffer the consequences as well as neglect the countless, more defenseless people in underdeveloped nations who do not contribute as much to climate change, but will suffer all the same, if not more.    
    
Definitely discuss if you disagree with my assessment at all or have critiques about their portrayal.    
   
Overall, though, I do think it is clear that the writers of South Park regret their previous treatment of climate change, and they don't have a very optimistic view about how mankind will address the issue going forward.","2018-11-16 23:11:57","462","64","0.97","https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/9xr9rw/last_two_south_park_episodes_revive_manbearpig_a/","True","Benign__Beags","1747796736.2010062","global warming myth","manual"
