"5c3hg4","collapse","skeptical","The new Yankee vicepresident and climate change","A lot of time is spent nowadays discussing Trump's policies. But what about his VP? What does he have to say about climate change?

>Pence ""**does not accept the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of climate change**."" In 2001, Pence wrote in an op-ed that ""Global warming is a myth,""saying that ""the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago"".In 2006 and 2009, Pence expressed the view that it was unclear whether climate change was driven by human activity, and in 2009 he told political commentator Chris Matthews that there was a ""growing skepticism in the scientific community about global warming”. In 2009, Pence led the Republican effort to defeat the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman-Markey), a Democratic-backed bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions (and therefore combat climate change) through a cap-and-trade system. On September 27, 2016, however, Pence said “there’s no question” that human activity affects both the climate and the environment, while defending Trump's position on the matter. **While in the House, Pence ""voted to eliminate funding for climate education programs and to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions.""** Pence also ""repeatedly voted against energy efficiency and renewable energy funding and rules"" and voted ""for several bills that supported fossil fuel development, including legislation promoting offshore drilling.""The League of Conservation Voters, an environmentalist group, gave Pence a lifetime rating of 4 percent. When asked if he accepts evolution, Pence answered ""I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that’s in them. How he did that I'll ask him about some day.""In a 2002 statement on the floor of the House (reported in the Congressional Record), Pence told his colleagues ""... I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe.""

The biggest polluter on the planet will be run by climate change deniers. Let that sink in.
