"6g1htb","climate","scientific","Help fact-checking a series of articles between the Weather Channel and Breitbart? (/r/climate_science xpost)","Hello, in an effort to better understand some acquaintances who subscribe to a ""climate change denial"" worldview, I was reading articles that would typically be used to support their position.  

I came across [this article on Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/11/30/global-temperatures-plunge-icy-silence-climate-alarmists/), which seems to propose that because there is record cooling happening right now, global warming is a myth.

Next, I found [an article from The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/news/news/breitbart-misleads-americans-climate-change) which takes the various claims of the Breitbart articles and gives evidence for disproving them.  

However, [I then found a rebuttal from Breitbart once again](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/07/weather-channel-attacks-breitbarts-climate-science-fake-news-climate-change/), which  similarly takes a step-by-step approach and seemingly refutes the Weather Channel article with various sources / charts.

Unfortunately, I couldn't seem to find any kind of response or follow up to this last article.  I imagine to a climate change denier, this would give the impression that Breitbart ""has the last word"" on this subject, and in their mind definitively proves they are correct.

I have tried investigating this on my own, but honestly I am no expert in this field, and have difficulty determining whether the sources / arguments used by Breitbart in their rebuttal are valid or not.  I am well aware that Breitbart has a long history of publishing completely falsified stories, however I was hoping to be able to make an evidence-based counterargument for their position.  Currently, I can understand how someone could stumble blindly into this whole discussion, see that both Breitbart and the Weather Channel claim the other is lying, and both sides cite charts and data to support them, and then deciding that it is too difficult / impossible to determine who is telling the truth.  Worse yet, they could conclude that since Breitbart ""got the final say"" with their last article, they may be correct.

**tl;dr:**

**Would anyone be able to help me fact-check the various claims made in all 3 articles (both Breitbart and The Weather Channel)?  E.G. Are the Weather Channel's objections in their article correct and well-supported?  Most importantly, what sources / evidence can either corroborate or refute the various claims made by the final Breitbart article?**

"6isyum","science","scientific","American Geophysical Union AMA: Hi Reddit, I'm Piers Forster, I am here to talk about what caused past global warming and what will happen in the future. I am currently Chair of Climate Physics and Director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate, University of Leeds, UK. Ask Me Anything!","I'm Piers Forster and I principally research causes of past climate change and how well we can predict future climate change. I can take Qs on the evidence base for human-induced global warming and how much we should trust our climate model predictions of possible futures, including uncertainty in climate sensitivity – the Earth’s response to a doubling of carbon dioxide – one of the biggest uncertainties in climate science. I also lead an interdisciplinary centre looking at climate solutions, and I would welcome a discussion of ideas on possible solutions. Does solar geoengineering or large-scale carbon capture and storage have legs? Where should we concentrate research effort? Any whacky ideas we should look into?

**I’ll be back at 11am EDT to answer your questions. Ask Me Anything!**

"6erjjd","science","scientific","r/science Stands with the Paris Climate Agreement","Hello everyone,

Earlier today [President Trump announced his intention to exit the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-announce-us-will-exit-paris-climate-deal/2017/06/01/fbcb0196-46da-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html?). While r/science ~~does not take a stance on political issues~~ *generally strives not to take a political stance, this issue is so exceptional and is heavily science-related that we made an exception*. We feel the need to reaffirm our commitment to solid science, and in that regard we strongly disagree with these actions. [Climate change is real](https://climate.nasa.gov/) and it's happening right now. [There is still time left to do something about it](https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/index.htm), but this requires the actions of all people of the world. 

We decided to create this thread to welcome discussion and questions from the users about climate change and the Paris Agreement. We will be moderating this thread [less heavily than we normally do](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules), but we still ask that you be civil and respectful in the comments.  Comments that go against established science must include **peer-reviewed** citations, and egregious dismissals may result in bans.

EDIT: Please note the edits above in italics. 

r/askscience is [also holding a megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ertms/askscience_megathread_climate_change/) on this issue. Feel free to ask questions there as well.","2017-06-02 02:06:29","72537","8322","0.68","https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6erjjd/rscience_stands_with_the_paris_climate_agreement/","True","rseasmith","1747779197.9532642","global warming myth","manual"
