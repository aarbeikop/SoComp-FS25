My university environmental science professor believes that we can't prove climate change is human-caused, due to the fact that the earth's temperature has always fluctuated for thousands of years-- way before humans even existed.

"dda1qx3","t3_5rtksv","5rtksv","science","scientific","Hi Tom, and thank you for doing this AMA.

Growing up, I remember that a big environmental concern was human activity causing ozone depletion in our atmosphere, leading to the so-called 'ozone hole'. It was quite the concern, if I remember correctly. Luckily, strong environmental policy and research advocacy led to the enactment of legislation restricting the use of the chemicals that were causing ozone depletion. And, recent news studies suggest that this approach worked - the ozone layer appears to be 'healing'.

SO my question is, to what extent is this possible for climate change? If humans got serious about reducing CO2 emissions, would we see a similar 'healing' of the climate?","2017-02-03 13:35:43","58","SirT6","1747775214.892402","global warming myth","manual"
"dd9zy8x","t3_5rtksv","5rtksv","science","scientific","Let's talk habitat destruction, environmental awareness and the 'going green' movement in the context of eco-conscious consumer choices. The topic is diverse but I want to just focus specifically on free-range beef.

People want free-range because it is being marketed as being beneficial to the consumer in terms of healthy living, but it is also being marketed as being more 'green' because animals live happier lives. However I hear arguments that free-range farming may not be as environmentally friendly as it may appear.

Is free-range farming beneficial to natural ecosystems and the global environment in the face of both growing populations and growing popularity in free-range produce? Or is the land required for free-range farming more detrimental in terms of habitat destruction than factory farming? 

We should all consume less meat, but if we don't...of the meat that we do consume is it a choice between happy cows and happy natural ecosystems or is it feasibly sustainable to have both?

One of the things he talks about is the very efficient conversion of atmospheric carbon to soil-based, and so he concludes that many of the models we use to predict long-term impacts of climate change are skewed by a lack of complete knowledge.

It sounds like you are coming from the other side of the table - like 'don't look to us soil-types to pick up the extra carbon, because we are not using these resources in a sustainable fashion either'   but I am very curious to hear your take on his somewhat contrarian view
