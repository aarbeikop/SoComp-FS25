"3fs933","climatechange","action-oriented","Looking for best experimental evidence that the increase in CO2 has caused global warming","I have to confess I posted a caustic, inflammatory rant against climate change advocates in an AMA thread featuring ""climate scientists"" yesterday.  I regret that, and as penance am doing my own research on this issue today, trying to keep an open mind.  I'm looking for  a straightforward experiment, preferably at say the high school level or even lower (not that I can't comprehend higher, just looking for clarity) that demonstrates unequivocally that purported increases in CO2 in the atmosphere have caused global warming. I think this is very important, because science at its core is about experiments, its not about showing respect for the opinions of people in lab coats with more degrees than you.

As far as experiments, example of what I am *not* looking for, is say, throwing alka-seltzer in one bottle and leaving another bottle untouched and then shining a light on them.  That isn't relevant to me because the purported increases of CO2 in the atmosphere is only about 100 parts per million.  However, I did find a promising experiment  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPRd5GT0v0I), by Mythbusters.  And it looked pretty compelling to begin with.  But the more I thought about it, it seems like there could be some fairly underhanded duplicity going on with it, which if true is a shame.  

One of the kid ""scientists"" queries an ""expert from UC Berkley"" if such an experiment is even possible  She responds, ""We can do experiments on a small scale in the lab...but its a challenge, I think it can be done, but its a challenge.""

But after that remark, they immediately start setting up an impressive experiment that if its results were as ultimately implied, it would demonstrate unequivocally that increased CO2 in the atmosphere has caused global warming, asfaic.  So why her remark that it was so difficult.  Its a warning sign I think.  

To handle the CO2 injection, they bring in ""Manish Gupta a gas monitoring expert from Los Gatos research""  The narrator says, ""the amount of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere is about 350 parts per million, but amounts that small are no problem for this [the Los Gatos] gear... so they can up the greenhouse gas levels in minutely accurate increments.""  However, what is very strange, is that he *never* says what level of CO2 was actually introduced into the glass box.  In fact at one point the display on the equipment says ""CO2 = 7.32%"".  Is this the level of CO2 they used?  Did they just jump through hoops to imply they would replicate earth atmosphere conditions as far as CO2 and then actually increase that amount by what, almost 200 fold?  It kind of looks that way. Really a shame if they were deceiving children. And if true, it implies something more broadly about the veracity of the climate change theory in general, as Mythbusters I think is supposed to have a fairly high reputation.

I have scoured the internet looking for substantive commentary on this video without success.  Is this the best there is as far as demonstrating CO2 global warming in the lab?  What *is* the most compelling experiment if not this?  I'm ready to be convinced if possible.
