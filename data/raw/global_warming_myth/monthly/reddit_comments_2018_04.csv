"dwxgjxk","t3_8abwjw","8abwjw","climatechange","action-oriented","Not an expert but basically this theory has been debunked. I usually don't like to link to skeptical science but they [do a good job on this one and have links to various depths of explanation](https://www.skepticalscience.com/saturated-co2-effect-advanced.htm). The punchline really is that there is direct satellite evidence that less CO2 absorption spectra has been radiating from earth as concentrations have increased. The 'saturation theory' as presented neglects the fact that CO2 has to also emit IR, which can then be reabsorbed by another CO2. Therefore more heat gets trapped near the earth's surface. I think I have that correct. I'd be interested in anyone else's input. Pick the level of explanation at skeptical science that suits you. I won't try to restate their work.

"dwyljpd","t3_8abwjw","8abwjw","climatechange","action-oriented","The mechanism for warming is counter intuitive.  Co2 is saturated entirely at sea level within a few 10s of meters in the bands in questions.

The real way Co2 is causes warming is actually its cooling effect on the stratosphere. Co2 emits IR as well as it absorbs it. When concentrations increase the upper atmosphere actually cools, which contracts then entire atmosphere, which in turn lowers the effective surface area of ""surface of last scattering"".  There is an energy imbalance because of the reduced surface area that heat can escape from.

The evidence of this stratospheric cooling is well understood from a theoretical physics point of view(Stephen Boltzmann's law).. but the actual evidence is basically non existent. We are talking about a change of a few dozen meters of the surface of last scattering(actual change in the surface area of the tenuous sphere is < 0.1% or ~ 2/1366 w/m^2).

As time has gone on, the predicted warming from Co2 is nearing(currently ~1.5 C TCS) a zero secondary feedback scenario, which is around 1 C TCS.

Its perfectly logical to be skeptical of the claims that we are mostly responsible and even more so that it might be dangerous or that we can do anything about it. These scientists that claim to have undeniable proof that the majority of global warming is man made are smoking crack. The people that say the solutions are undeniable are even more deranged.

"dwmkwv4","t3_88q8my","88q8my","environment","emotional","Not going to comment on anything else, but as far as burning trees for renewable energy, it's as renewable as it gets. Every gram of carbon that comes out was captured from the air in the last 50-100 years. And it makes land available for more trees. As long as they are planting new trees at the same rate, it's much better than burning any other fossil fuel from a carbon perspective. I would imagine it's better from a sulfur perspective as well.","2018-04-01 14:03:51","2","frothface","1747789569.086124","global warming myth","manual"

The problem is capitalism -- addressing global warming will make some capitalists rich, and some of the existing rich capitalists will have to change or they'll lose money. Naomi Klein brilliantly makes this point, that the problem is capitalism.

But since capitalism is untouchable according to our 2 ruling parties, nothing is done and the mass media continues to feed us infotainment while they refuse to put the severity of the problem in context so we can force changes to be enacted.
