"dkmlf60","t3_6p4jcq","6p4jcq","science","scientific","To clarify, is the claim that gender dysphoria is a qualifying condition for *being trans* considered unacceptable?

I ask because for many trans individuals, transition is a *treatment* for dysphoria, and in many but not all cases allows them to eliminate or reduce the dysphoria that they feel. As far as I am aware, there is no substantial consensus in the medical, scientific, or transgender communities on whether experiencing dysphoria at some point in one's life is a necessary and/or sufficient condition for someone to be considered trans.

I subscribe to the side that says that dysphoria is both necessary and sufficient, but I also consider ""transgender"" to be a demographic designation without particular scientific meaning, similar to terms used to denote ethnicity.

Are my opinions considered acceptable on /r/science? Further, is the necessity or sufficiency of dysphoria in relation to trans identities considered an acceptable subject for debate on /r/science? I appreciate that this is a tricky question, especially given that ""transgender"" is, in my opinion, a term which lacks a strict scientific definition, especially as opposed to the medical diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria.""

And you justify that with the except from the APA

>A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder

I don't see how having ""many"" (3 or more?) people from a group not feeling distress from their gender can make it somehow make it anti-science to say it is a mental disorder. What if I found ""many"" people from this group that DID feel distress from this? From [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/23/471265599/probing-the-complexities-of-transgender-mental-health):

> The researchers, led by Sari Reisner, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, [found that](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2504261) the rate of psychiatric disorders and substance dependence among these women was 1.7 to 3.6 times greater than in the general population.

>Four in 10 of the women had a mental health or substance dependence disorder, and 1 in 5 women had at least two diagnosed psychiatric conditions. More than a third of them had experienced depression, and 1 in 5 women had contemplated suicide in the past month. Rates of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol dependence and other substance dependence also was higher than average.

Are these not signs of distress? Are you arguing it was just a coincidence that they were transgender?

You are literally saying that the use of ""sick"" or ""mentally ill"" is derogatory. 

Probably the vast majority of people are on the sliding scale of mental illness with most people coping and getting by on a daily basis.

Claiming that to question the root cause or causes of transgenderism is equivalent to being anti-vax is absolutely anti-scientific. This is an evolving field of study and there is a complete lack of long term data on this and it is not a well understood field at all.

Vaccines are well understood. And long established medical therapies.

If someone wants to say that surgery is not a treatment for someone who is trans, that person then is making something akin to an anti-vax statement as it has been established that yes, surgery is a treatment. Whether or not it is the best treatment or if science and technology can give us alternatives or better treatments in the future is an open question, but the basis of your ruling here will ban people from talking about it.

I suspect that the APA's refusal to call transgenderism a mental illness is political. It is very difficult to advance the rights that you want when you are seen as mentally ill.  

And pinning all of the discomfort and difficulty trans people face on ""society"" is somewhat disingenuous.

People with schizophrenia face huge social barriers to treatment, employment, etc. Society is not kind to them at all. They still have a mental illness. The problems they face are rooted in that mental illness and the behaviors it causes that are incompatible with existing in society. 

This intense avoidance of the term ""mental illness"" in regards to trans people is offensive to people with mental illness. If you want treatment money out of the mental illness pot, if you want resources and lobbying from the mental health community, but you refuse to carry the weight of a mental illness diagnosis, then what is going on, exactly?
