"3jhn44","climatechange","action-oriented","Q: What is the relationship between El Niño/La Niña and global warming?",">A: **The jury is still out on this.** Are we likely to see more El Niños because of global warming? Will they be more intense? These are the main research questions facing the science community today. Research will help us separate the natural climate variability from any trends due to man's activities. **We cannot figure out the ""fingerprint"" of global warming if we cannot sort out what the natural variability does.** We also need to look at the link between decadal changes in natural variability and global warming. At this time we can't preclude the possibility of links but it would be too early to definitely say there is a link.
