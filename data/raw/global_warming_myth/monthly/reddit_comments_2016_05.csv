"d35a7st","t3_4jbigy","4jbigy","collapse","skeptical","Here's your problem:  You're trying to make Alex Jones make sense.

It's fascinating to watch how he tries to weave current events into his overall globalist narrative, but he doesn't care if there are holes or hanging threads, and neither does his audience.  It's all about what works *right now* to maintain or expand his audience and sell more water purifiers or whatever.

If anything, he is useful to the globalist elites because he keeps a segment of the population distracted, confused, emotionally raw but also perpetually inert.  They don't do much but listen and wait.  They don't trust their neighbours so they aren't likely to form any grassroots movements.  Not that an Alex Jones was created by the globalist elites, but he's there so they might as well take advantage.

I figure he partly believes and partly knows he's full of shit.","2016-05-14 14:59:24","26","candleflame3","1747763594.773061","global warming myth","manual"

Setting aside the chicken little one, it seems like a false dichotomy between heroically keeping temps under 2C or burning everything in the absolute worst possible way.  It seems like there is a lot of room for an outcome between those two.  For example, I think it highly unlikely that population levels will remain anywhere near as high as they are for more than a few decades at the absolute most.  There's not going to be 10 Billion people burning coal in 2100.  At least I highly doubt it.  If the population plummets due to energy constraints, phosphorus depletion, soil erosion etc., in the next few decades, I think the silver lining for whoever survives is that the worst case greenhouse scenarios are avoided.

Not sure if you were being literal or not, but methane due to ""enteric fermentation"" (raising ruminant livestock, such as cows) accounts for about [19% of global methane emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane).  Fossil fuel production and rice farming are another two huge contributors.

Of course, you're right, human emissions of methane are about double the production of what the planet does naturally.  This is completely unacceptable.

Unless you're a professional teacher, it's not your job to teach this knowledge to others. It's the job of the educational institutes or the government. When those institutions fail to do their job, you can either try to change their mind (via petitions, demonstrations or voting) or you can choose another country in which things are going better.

Your only personal responsibility in light of this knowledge is to not make things worse personally. Watch your carbon footprint and keep it on a sustainable level. That's everything you need to do. Everybody else has this personal responsibility too, and if they don't follow it it's not your fault. If you warn people close to you from immediate risks, that's a nice bonus. For example, I warned everybody in my social circle not to buy a house, and not to invest in the stock market right now, because the credit bubble is too big to be trusted.
