"cts20rd","t3_3fs933","3fs933","climatechange","action-oriented","It has been my experience that the people who deny the science of AGW do so because they do not understand science very well at all.  The denial of AGW is basically a conspiracy theory and you find many of our vocal deniers hanging around conservative and conspiracy theory subreddits.  This explains a lot.  The denial of AGW is fundamentally a *political position*, not a scientific position at all.  Considering that so many deniers speak openly of a vast conspiracy among climate scientists it is not a surprise.  I am always amazed when when someone who sells shoes for a living proclaims that climate scientists are either:

A) Bumbling idiots who drool on themselves and cannot tie their shoes

or

B) A cult embarked on an evil conspiracy to control the world.

It is funny how both A) and B) apply directly to science deniers and one of their leaders who claims to be a meteorologist was formerly a TV weather girl.  It is breathtaking how they feel such incompetent fools would independently - around the world - decide to cook up this nefarious plot to destroy everything America holds dear.  With all the money they have to spread FUD it is a shame they can't do a credible job.","2015-08-05 06:24:35","3","Long_dan","1747755643.7748082","global warming myth","manual"

"ctsh4vi","t3_3fs933","3fs933","climatechange","action-oriented","I think you might be asking the wrong question.  I'm not saying it's wrong to ask questions about how we know what we know.  Far from it.  I'm all for asking those sorts of questions.  What I'm suggesting is that the expected warming from CO2 itself is pretty small, on the order of 1°C per doubling of atmospheric CO2.  The total warming expected from CO2 will depend very much on net feedbacks, and there is a wide range of estimates as to those.

But if you really want to delve into the historic experiments that determine CO2 absorption bands, there is a good summary here:

This is, however, only about direct CO2-related forcing. It's not about albedo changes, it's not about water vapor changes, it is not about all kinds of positive feedbacks expected to come from temperature change which are basis of scary projections from computer models. And as far as I know, those, rather than direct CO2 effect are the matter of the disagreement between ""warmists"" and ""deniers"".","2015-08-06 09:38:24","1","Kasuha","1747755643.77953","global warming myth","manual"

This test is unedited with an included full 30 min real time video to back it up.  The test proves that Co2 is actually colder then air and argon in that type of test.

--------------------

Also, here is a peer reviewed paper disproving the ""Bill Nye Co2 test"" http://www.tufts.edu/~rtobin/Wagoner%20AJP%202010.pdf

Some commentary on that paper. http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2014/08/paper-proves-bill-nyes-faked-greenhouse.html

-------------------


Co2 absorbs more IR then air... BUT it also RE-EMITS it better as well.  Thus, in a closed chamber the one with Co2 will actually be colder then the one without.

That test is not just wrong... It fails to address the basic physics of why Co2 causes GW in the atmosphere.  The fundamental physics predict that Its actually cooling the upper atmosphere, which changes the lapse rate, which causes a heating effect on the air below it from increase density and increase water vapor carrying capacity.

The real world observations are lacking for the basic physics(cooling stratosphere AND warming troposphere).  This article should help explain it. http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2014/08/why-does-co2-cool-stratosphere-warm.html

>Really a shame if they were deceiving children. And if true, it implies something more broadly about the veracity of the climate change theory in general, as Mythbusters I think is supposed to have a fairly high reputation.

It's TV.  Obviously it's faked and there is peer reviewed proof to back it up. This test is one of the most debunked in all of science. You can't necessarily blame the mythbusters for this... because they are just following their bosses orders. That said, don't believe everything you see on TV.","2015-08-04 21:33:51","-2","FireFoxG","1747755643.781379","global warming myth","manual"
"ctsm6fr","t3_3fs933","3fs933","climatechange","action-oriented","In this discussion I happened to recall biosphere 2,  and they had problems from day 1, literally, with excess CO2, and the CO2 levels just kept growing and growing throughout the duration of it.  And this was a condition that they had not prepared in advance for at all.  As it turns out, it was caused exclusively by microbes in the soil, and then, the CO2 was reacting with the concrete of the biosphere structure, before it could be utilized by the plants or something.  Biosphere 2 had been set up in advance with very intricate systems for managing heating and cooling.  The massive amounts of CO2, (many, many times larger than the minisicule 100 ppm increase in Earth's atmosphere) is not something they prepared for in advance at all.  Yet I defy anyone to show where the Biosphere 2 team had problems with excess heat they couldn't handle.","2015-08-05 18:43:15","0","Bill_Cody","1747755643.782657","global warming myth","manual"
"cttxo39","t3_3fs933","3fs933","climatechange","action-oriented","Thanks for the continuing feedback from all. A slightly off-topic query, (but its an honest one).  Would climate change policy makers be happy if the entire 7 billion population of the world dispensed with oil and started burning firewood for fuel instead?  Would that be a solution?  Presumably not, as burning firewood itself releases carbon dioxide like a fossil fuel. So, isn't the underlying problem really the population?  That's why I suspect the truly comprehending in the climate change advocacy world are intentionally using CO2 as merely a euphemism for what they perceive as the real problem that must be dealt with -- i.e. too many people.

Speaking of firewood,  I've read most of a book (not recalling the title but the following are probably adequate search terms) that said over the course of the 20th century, there was a dramatic and contuing rebound in forests across the US as firewood continually declined as a fuel source.  And as a direct result, it said that there are now huge and in fact unmanagable  populations of all  sorts of North American animals, e.g. black bears, deer, etc.  The huge number of forest fires is also related to this.  Also, think about all the land masses that were practically denuded of forests many centuries ago -- England, Sicily, Haiti, etc.  This phenomenon just doesn't seem to happen anymore.","2015-08-06 19:31:15","-1","Bill_Cody","1747755643.784409","global warming myth","manual"
