Gore presents evidence from all corners of globe in his book ""Inconvenient"". They should have just supported it from the beginning.","2018-11-17 01:56:15","146","Nude-eh","1747796737.50664","global warming myth","manual"
"e9ulzhz","t3_9xr9rw","9xr9rw","collapse","skeptical","> Overall, though, I do think it is clear that the writers of South Park regret their previous treatment of climate change, and they don't have a very optimistic view about how mankind will address the issue going forward.

Probably too little and too late, but at least they admitted their mistake.  If nothing else, and also for what little it's worth, the show was pretty funny and this season has been a real return to form.  :/","2018-11-16 23:56:59","124","NihiloZero","1747796737.508126","global warming myth","manual"
"e9uvqsa","t3_9xr9rw","9xr9rw","collapse","skeptical","I  watched this 10 minutes ago and was glad to see a post about it here. Really fascinating couple episodes! My brother felt South Park was getting bad and even the show knew it, but these last two felt like a bit of redemption, the reason being that South Park has always been good at satire, but when reality itself is a joke it's not much fun to make jokes about it (they don't even have Trump as a character on the show). 

Climate change, or as the show addresses it, ManBearPig, is an ACTUAL problem, the way our culture deals with it is an ACTUAL problem, and the South Park formula of satire works here where less metaphorical methods would not. I am continually amazed at how mainstream climate change is now becoming. South Park has a substantial audience. It was a great choice, I felt, for the kids to decide to buy off MBP because they don't want to give up Red Dead Redemption II. It shows how cynical we are as a culture, and I guess it's up to us to choose whether we will really give up everything for a few more years of video games (or cars or gas or iphones or whatever)","2018-11-17 02:38:46","57","Tigaj","1747796737.5104718","global warming myth","manual"

"e9unv7g","t3_9xr9rw","9xr9rw","collapse","skeptical","i don't think they regret their previous treatment of climate change, and really the original manbearpig was about taking shots at al gore and his movie than denying the reality of climate change, at the same time noting that the masses arent going to care until climate change affects them. putting all the manbearpig episodes together you can see its about public awareness and reaction to climate change, which has ramped up a ton in recent months and weeks. If I know south park, the creators are less interested in actual issues than they are with media coverage and public reaction to these issues.","2018-11-17 00:24:43","30","nostrilcarpocalypse","1747796737.513708","global warming myth","manual"
