"bhus28","ClimateActionPlan","unknown","What to put on a handout sheet?","So I'm fortunate enough to work in a job where I can talk to small groups of people everyday about a topic more or less having to do with nature and the environment. 

I'm trying to put together a paper hand out I can give to people to spread awareness about global warming and what they can do to shrink their carbon footprint.

To save on resources (paper, ink) I'm limiting the handouts to what I can put on a 1/4 or 1/2 sheet of paper. 

On ONE SIDE, I have the typical ways of shrinking your foot print:

>Eat less meat  
Use less plastic  
Consume less  
Buy used where possible  
Refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, recycle, rot  
Drive less - walk, bike, carpool, take public transit  
Avoid flying by plane  
Buy locally  
Compost green waste  
Plant a tree or ten (native species)  
Wash clothes in cold water/hang dry  
Use less electricity  
Donate to environmental causes    
Research and spread awareness  
Talk to your representatives about renewables and vote

But I'm lost on what exactly I can put on the other side of the sheet, info wise.

I work in government, so I can't really come at it from too biased of an angle (""Vote dem/green!""), and it has to be professional. (I might be able to talk a little about Greta Thunberg, but not necessarily Extinction Rebellion, for example.)

Ideas? Maybe some credible websites, list some documentaries to watch, some social media hashtags? But which? As much as I LOVE me some good graphics, I want to keep them to a minimum because the 1/4-1/2 size page limit.","2019-04-27 02:53:34","3","1","1.0","https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/bhus28/what_to_put_on_a_handout_sheet/","True","rezkidsinlove","1747800423.924633","global warming myth","manual"
"bh6mk8","sustainability","action-oriented","An Opinion on Electric Vehicles","Transportation pollution is a significant contributor to humans ecological footprint, but we often sacrifice the effects to our ecosystems for the convenience and reliability of combustion vehicles. We are consistently searching for more ideal solutions to preserve our planet, but this presents a wicked problem. Electric vehicles are widely considered the future of sustainable personal travel, but the ecological hardships that come with producing and recycling lithium ion batteries make them far from ideal until new solutions to ease these hardships are brought to light. 

First I want to address the ecological obstacles that we have encountered in the production of lithium ion batteries and electric vehicles in general. Although these vehicles undoubtedly have less of a negative ecological impact than combustion-powered vehicles once on the road, when you factor in the energy used and emissions created by their production it can end up being the same or worse for the environment than regular vehicles. Jonathan Eckart of the World Economic Forum wrote that “electric vehicles can generate more carbon emissions over their lifecycle – from procurement of raw materials to manufacturing, use and recycling – than petrol or diesel cars” and stated that “producing an electric vehicle contributes, on average, twice as much to global warming potential and uses double the amount of energy than producing a combustion engine car. This is mainly because of its battery. Battery production uses a lot of energy, from the extraction of raw materials to the electricity consumed in manufacture” (Eckart, 2017). This brings to light a clear problem with making electric vehicles the future of transportation. I believe that until drastic changes are made in these production processes, we can’t settle for electric vehicles as our best option. 

Not only is the production of these batteries a problem, recycling and disposing of the materials that make up these batteries is economically and ecologically costly. The active chemicals in lithium ion batteries do not degrade naturally or can be reused easily after use, posing a major threat to groundwater and any ecosystem they are disposed of in. Often times when a battery is too used up to be reliable for transportation it still has enough power to be used for smaller tasks, but this is rarely done and the batteries are irresponsibly thrown away. The lithium in these batteries can be recycled for reuse in new batteries as well, but as of now the process isn’t cost effective and can’t provide any profit to those who choose to do it. Jonathan Eckart states that “To recycle a battery, it currently costs €1 per kg. But the value of raw material reclaimed is only a third of that. Recycling lithium costs five times as much as extracting virgin material” (Eckart, 2017). This shows that even though we have the technology to safely recycle these harmful materials, many companies won’t pursue it because it has no financial benefit. These vehicles are becoming more and more common as stated by Ashley Schmid, and as they become exponentially more common on the road we have to address these problems to make electric vehicles a truly viable option for sustainable personal transportation. 

Although there is a plethora of obstacles caused by the batteries in electric vehicles, they are the key to making these vehicles work and have made great progress in the last decade. According to Schmid, technology improvements in lithium-ion batteries due to trending popularity and progressive tax incentives have driven the cost of batteries in a Tesla Roadster from starting at “upwards of 900 dollars” in 2008 , where now “They now hold double the energy by weight and only cost 300 dollars per kilowatt-hour” (Schmid, 2017). There are solutions to these problems; the main one is making these batteries more financially realistic. Technology improvements make these batteries cheaper to produce and much more efficient in their use. We need to constantly push to make these batteries more affordable, common, and using less energy until they are even cheaper to make than combustion based vehicles. This speaks for battery recycling as well, as it becomes more financially beneficial many more companies will push to reuse lithium from recycled batteries. There are also alternatives as a solution that are consistently becoming more popular, such as cars powered by biofuels or solar power.

There are many obstacles that pose major threats to the future of electric vehicles and sustainable travel in general. The key for us as a human citizens is to be able to realistically recognize these obstacles, and instead of being satisfied with the improvements made we need to always push for the next technological advancement that makes these vehicles even better. Sustainability is about never being satisfied and always yearning to know more about the problems we face so we can better confront and solve them. No one solution will satisfy everybody which makes this such a wicked problem, but the first step to solving these problems is recognizing the issues with our current solution and tackling them on the way to finding truly sustainable personal travel.

In 2017 global carbon emissions topped 38 million tons of [carbon](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-global-co2-emissions-set-to-rise-2-percent-in-2017-following-three-year-plateau), a 2% increase from the year previous and. 2017's carbon emissions will cause $7.2 trillion of harm of harm to the global economy and it seems more and more unlikely that the political will can be mustered to substantially reduce carbon emissions. While carbon emissions disproportionately originate in wealthy nations, it is the developing world that will bear the most [severe ](https://eos.org/scientific-press/study-global-warming-hits-poorest-nations-hardest)consequences. In today's podcast episode, I will be discussing how some countries in the developing world are adapting to climate change. I will discuss the Cape Town water crisis, the impact of climate change on agriculture in Russia, and Bangladesh's management of cyclones and floods.

While most climate change models predict increased levels of precipitation, [most ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-what-climate-models-tell-us-about-future-rainfall)climate change models that by 2050, levels of rainfall in South Africa will decrease by around 25%. Capetown suffered from severe drought between 2015 and 2017, and by mid-2018 people became afraid that Cape Town would reach day zero, the point at which the municipal government would be forced to close the taps and force people to [queue ](https://physicsworld.com/a/cape-town-day-zero-water-crisis-due-to-migrating-moisture-corridor/)for water at public water stations. The city government was forced to resort to drastic measures, including banning the watering of lawns, creating a water use goal of only 13 [gallons ](http://time.com/cape-town-south-africa-water-crisis/)(one 90 second shower, and four toilet flushes) of water per day and automatically shut off water to households that used more than 93 gallons and a public relations campaign to not flush toilets after urination. The government was able to reduce water consumption by [50%](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/cape-town-running-out-of-water-drought-taps-shutoff-other-cities/), and solid rainfalls in 2018 ended the crisis. A wide swathe of the world is expected to see substantial drying over the next 50 years, including the Mediterranean region, Central America and the American West, and western Australia, and cities in these regions will have to adapt ""300 year"" droughts happening more and more often.

While climate change will make South Africa more inhospitable to humanity, the opposite is true in Russia. Climate change is expected to [increase ](https://www.climatechangepost.com/russia/climate-change/)temperatures by around 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) over the next 50 years and levels of precipitation are expected to increase by more than 25%. While higher temperatures and precipitation will allow the extension of agriculture northwards and [allow ](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrei_Kirilenko2/publication/226981684_Climate_change_food_stress_and_security_in_Russia/links/09e41511126ddc89b9000000/Climate-change-food-stress-and-security-in-Russia.pdf)for a longer growing season, it is unclear what the impact of climate change will be in the log run. Agriculture in Russia is concentrated in southern Russia, where highly fertile Chernozerm black soils allow for some of the most productive soils in the world and most climate change models project reduced rainfall and increased [drought ](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00360.1)in this region. Russia in 2017 produced 86 million tons of wheat, making it the [3rd largest](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#rankings/countries_by_commodity) wheat-producer in the world. Russian wheat production increased by 76% over the last ten years, and in 2018 Russia became the largest wheat exporter in the world. Global warming will dramatically [reduce ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/1/014010/pdf)agricultural yields in much of the world. The only way to avoid catastrophic hunger is for countries such as Russia where climate change will improve agricultural potential to increase agricultural production.

While climate change has created opportunities in some countries, it poses an existential risk to others. Bangladesh has always suffered severe weather events. Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed 500,000 people, and Bangladesh has [suffered ](https://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/deadlyworld.asp)from seven of the ten deadliest cyclones in world history. Bangladesh suffers from deadly floods every year with one fifth of the country inundated every year. Flooding is [exacerbated ](https://qz.com/india/1432375/climate-change-may-force-200000-people-in-bangladesh-to-migrate/)by increased levels of rainfall and rising sea levels from global warming. Bangladesh has been able to dramatically reduce cyclone mortality thanks to the Cyclone Preparedness Program. The CPP is a volunteer force of [55,000 ](https://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/press-releases/asia-pacific/bangladesh/ifrc-launches-emergency-appeal-to-aid-coastal-communities-in-bangladesh-affected-by-cyclone-roanu/)people that organizes educational campaigns and maintains shelters before cyclones, coordinates evacuation programs during cyclones, and provides first aid and rescue services after cyclones. Between 1991 and 2009 the government doubled the number of public cyclone shelters to 3,976. Bangladesh has suffered three Category 5 cyclones since 1970. Cyclone Bhola in 1970 killed 500,000 people and Cyclone Gorky in 1991 killed 140,000 people, while Cyclone Sidr in 2007 killed only 3,000 [people](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/cyclone-sidr-bangladesh-damage-loss-and-needs-assessment-disaster-recovery-and). Bangladesh has been similarly proactive in dealing with floods. The government distributes millions of Water Purification Tablets, and Oral Rehydration Solution before floods. The government has subsidized the construction of [tubewells ](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-effective-systems-keep-diarrhoea-check-even-during-floods)to ensure access to clean water during floods, so as to minimize levels of cholera and other water-borne [illnesses](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-effective-systems-keep-diarrhoea-check-even-during-floods). Thanks to these pro-active actions, Bangladesh did not have a [single ](https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/2017/08/30/bangladesh-eliminates-post-flood-disease-deaths/)flood induced diarrhea death despite massive flooding in 2017.

In today's podcast episode, I have discussed how Capetown, Russia and South Africa have adapted to climate change. I often hear climate change described as an apocalypse that will destroy our ability to survive. The experience of the three countries in this podcast suggests it is possible to adapt to climate change. However, not all places have institutions as adaptive as those of South Africa and Bangladesh, and there are limits to human ingenuity. Unless political leaders in high carbon emitting countries figure out how to curb emissions, we may discover these limits with catastrophic consequences.
