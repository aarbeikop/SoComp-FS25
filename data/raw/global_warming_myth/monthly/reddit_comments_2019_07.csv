I'm not a scientist so I can't refute it scientifically but I know that they can determine the amount of co2 in the air and can see the effect it has.  It's all measurable, we can see the temperature in the past and how much co2 was in the atmosphere back then.  They can measure the h20 and see the effect of that.  I can't imagine that the rise in temperatures from h20 happens to be the exact same amount then if it would be if it was the c02 and every scientist missed this.","2019-07-01 11:35:15","13","Batchet","1747802900.252217","global warming myth","manual"

>Increases in water vapour greenhouse effect are small because additional vapour cannot reach the upper troposphere, and greenhouse-gas warming is outweighed by increases in reflectance from humidity-induced low cloud cover, leading to a near-zero or small cooling effect. 


Their result:

>We find that vapour added at current irrigation rates would yield a net ERF of −0.1 to +0.05 Wm−2, and that the 100 year effective GWP for vapour emitted near the surface is −0.001 to +0.0005, making emitted water, at best, a thousand times less effective per kg at altering the heat budget of the Earth than emitted carbon dioxide.

Also, according to their source, only about 1000 gigatons of water is emitted from irrigation each year (I calculated from their 32500m3/s value)","2019-07-01 13:48:53","9","unmistakableregret","1747802900.255727","global warming myth","manual"

"eshdxs9","t3_c7razk","c7razk","climatechange","action-oriented","Okay I understand your logic here but at the very core the problem is that the water cycle doesnt change all that much. There is such a huge amount of water in the world that humans using it for uses such as agriculture don't make an impact. Even if we move water around, the same amount is going to be evaporated(more or less, but changes aren't statistically significant). 

That isn't to say water isnt affected by man, but we can't possibly evaporate enough manually compared to the historical norm to make a difference. Warmer weather in the atmosphere will increase water in the atmosphere, which yes, will increase warming.

I’m pretty sure we know it is CO2 because we can measure the spectrum difference between 0 and 20km in the atmosphere, and use atmosphere heat content to calculate energy balance, and the radiative forcing of respective greenhouse gases is calculated.

So why do you propose water used by humans for agriculture is so much more likely to evaporate than water not used for agriculture? The same amount of water still exists if it isn't used by humans.

\----------------------------------------------

Edit:[Here's a science reporting article](https://physicsworld.com/a/are-our-water-vapour-emissions-warming-the-climate/) written about this subject with links to scientific studies. The main study finds an upper bound forcing due to water vapor emissions from irrigation is 0.05W/m2 (though the uncertainty range doesn't rule out a very small negative forcing). That compares with about 2W/m2 for CO2.

The thing people often don't understand about the greenhouse effect is that **where** the gases are in the atmosphere is just as important as how much. In the case of surface water vapor emissions, they typically don't rise very high in the atmosphere before dropping out again, so the amount of water vapor at any given moment may be elevated but it's almost all at low altitudes. It's gases at high altitudes which really make the difference. CO2 has a strong effect because the concentration is well mixed even up into the stratosphere, whereas water vapor concentrations decline strongly beyond the first few kilometres. As it says in the article, even though the amounts of water vapor involved are likely to be much less, water vapor emissions from air travel may have a larger effect than irrigation due to the high altitude.","2019-07-01 12:32:30","1","skeeezoid","1747802900.2686179","global warming myth","manual"
"esh7cvh","t3_c7razk","c7razk","climatechange","action-oriented","Ok .. i find quite a few places saying that water vapor is a greenhouse gas .. and actually it is the most dominant one. Here is one example.

&#x200B;

 [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/greenhouse-gases.php?section=watervapor](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/greenhouse-gases.php?section=watervapor) 

&#x200B;

But the key argument, and I quote .. "" However, changes in its concentration is also considered to be a result of climate *feedbacks* related to the warming of the atmosphere rather than a direct result of industrialization. ""

&#x200B;

My read is that the amount of water vapor is so high in the atmosphere that human activities have little impact in its over all warming effect, while what we do can affect the amount of CO2 (as a percentage) substantially. Secondly, i believe the carbon emission is cumulative .. that is why we have a carbon budget.

&#x200B;

Water vapor is dynamic .. it changes all the time .. water evaporated becomes rain (and snow and sleet and so on) and comes back down again. So while we need to understand the dynamics, there is less of a need to control its ""emissions"".","2019-07-01 12:42:38","1","[deleted]","1747802900.270945","global warming myth","manual"

Sidebar: your source seems very weird in that it discusses the surface area change of freshwater evaporation when we know three quarters of the surface area of the Earth are already water in direct contact with the atmosphere, and that oceans are the dominant source of evaporation.

Mankind truly destroys all it comes in contact with, it’s a sad reality, but it’s the truth. There is more potential in the world. I’ve had it told to me many times that Homo sapiens are the only species that can think about long term future gains. The example is with the study on chimpanzees, I believe. Researchers have placed food inside a basket (something a monkey would want to eat, obviously) and let the monkey try to get it out through the gaps and openings in the basket. Monkeys apparently only think of the now rather than the long term sustainability of not eating whatever’s in the basket for the sake of using your hand to its full potential.
