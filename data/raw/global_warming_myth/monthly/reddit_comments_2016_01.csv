Correct. I've mentioned here and elsewhere that the climate talks in Paris were going to be a joke (obviously) and that, after panic, [geoengineering was inevitable.](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/cop21-paris-deal-far-too-weak-to-prevent-devastating-climate-change-academics-warn-a6803096.html) Incompetent and self-destructive behavior is so predictable from this species it's nauseating.","2016-01-10 14:55:25","8","EntropyAnimals","1747760126.2570848","global warming myth","manual"

and it won't.  It's not in us, it's why we're in the 'pickle' we're in.  There are no scaleable solutions here.

All we can do is modify our own lives to ensure we aren't complicit in the madness (low emissions, low consumption), engage with friends and peers on the issue if they are receptive, vote wisely and build resilience into our lifestyles as an insurance agaisnt collapse.

There is nothing else we can do.","2016-01-10 22:34:01","5","Capn_Underpants","1747760126.260403","global warming myth","manual"

I have the odds around 50/50 over whether there will be anything left of our species by 2050. We stand at a crossroads between creation and destruction.

OK, but there are also *ancient* ideals of human rights and social justice found in indigenous, low-energy, hunter-gatherer type societies.  And, *we can think up new ones to suit new circumstances*.  It is by no means inevitable that collapse means oppression and inequality.","2016-01-10 18:43:49","4","candleflame3","1747760126.2635021","global warming myth","manual"

This is interesting. So these oligarchs are the bad guys right? They will let billions of people die. But what if they offered you a place in their safe space during the catastrophe? Would you accept and would you be able to be a part of society with that kind of history?","2016-01-10 06:39:25","2","Nzl","1747760126.264603","global warming myth","manual"
"cysr825","t3_409z4e","409z4e","collapse","skeptical","I agree with some of the points you're making but I just don't see a way out of this as long as capitalism in its current form prevails. Now don't get me wrong, I actually still believe in democratic capitalism, I think it's the balance needed to support socialism. But clearly you can't have a system of one or the other or it becomes corrupted. You need a system that includes a healthy balance of both.

Democracy at its core is about the will of the people, and if people actually knew the truth of what was happening in this world then maybe we could create a system that reflects the true values of the planet. Sadly, as it stands currently the systems we have now are too corrupt to even allow a silent majority the ability to speak. 

There is so much misinformation, distraction, censorship, and propaganda out there very few Americans understand what is happening to this country or the world. We're all trapped in a Casino trying to buy our way out playing games we can never win.

Furthermore we need more then just a revolution in the US. We need to end slavery throughout the world, end our planets reliance on fossil fuels, industrial food, and put an end to our existing systems of ownership. There has to be a transition to facilitate all of this, and the resources required to do this out are simply out of touch of anyone with a brain capable of making the decisions necessary to make this a reality. 

Even Reddit is another illusion, sure you believe we are making connections right now and organizing. In a sense we are, but it isn't the same kind of connections that happen offline. The power and technology we have now is capable of changing the world and bringing us together but it won't happen until crony capitalism is abolished. 

Unfortunately the most likely scenario is the oligarchy will fail on its own through its own means. It will likely take years of decay and corruption, and even then it might just slowly crumble to irrelevancy rather then a major extinction event. 

Until capitalism in its current form is abandoned then the planet is fucked until someone figures out how either leave the planet for a profit or geo-engineer a solution for a profit. Either way, I don't want to live through either of those scenarios. ","2016-01-10 09:40:49","1","applextrent","1747760126.267416","global warming myth","manual"
