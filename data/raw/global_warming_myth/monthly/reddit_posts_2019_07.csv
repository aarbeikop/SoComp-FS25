"c7razk","climatechange","action-oriented","Couldn’t find a flaw in this conspiracy about an alternative cause of global warming","Humans consume 10 million gigatons of water each year. 70% of that is used to water  plants in agriculture (1). The water on the fields has 3 ways to go:
 - sinking deep into lower levels of the soil 
 - evaporate 
 - being absorbed by the plants (what also eventually leads to evaporation, because plants evaporate water over the leaves)

Actually farmers try to increase field water efficiency (fraction of water used by plants to total water used) but let’s say only 10% evaporate. That means 700 000 gigatons of water evaporate each year. Most of it by Irrigation. Rivers are redirected and spread over huge agricultural areas. On that area the sun developes enough energy to evaporate the water while it would just run into  the ocean without human influence. So we are basically evaporating rivers all over the world. And that is much more efficient than digging for coal and burn it.

But what about rain? Water doesn’t stay in the atmosphere!

Yes, and that’s why many reliable sources claim human couldn’t influence water content in the atmosphere. Because it comes down again, it can’t increase, can it? Yes of course it can. The numbers of airplanes in the air is increasing even though they don’t stuck in the air. Around 16000 planes are in the air right now (2019) and this number is going to increase. Around 200000 takeoffs  every day, which means around 8000 take offs per hour. An average flight duration of 2 hours means, that when you take off, 16 000 other planes take off before you land. And if you increase the take offs per hour you will have more planes in the air, even if the average duration remains at 2 hours.
So the same thing with water. Water remains about 10 days in the atmosphere (2). As mentioned earlier, 700 000 gigatons are evaporated each year. That means 2000 gigatons per day. So within the 10 day lifetime of water 20 000 gigatons are  evaporated due to human influences. Compared to CO2 we emit 30 gigatons each year. according to the simple calculation above we increased the water content much more than we increased CO2. And that while H2O is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. That would mean water vapor is the main cause of global warming!

Why can’t we measure the increase of water?

A gas needs around 1 year to reach each part of the atmosphere and even longer to be homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. Since the lifetime of CO2 is so large, it actually is almost homogeneously mixed in the atmosphere. That means if you measure CO2 in only one spot, you know the content on alle other spots, because it’s the same.
H20 however has a short life time. The water content varies extremely in different location. When you see clouds, the water content is higher in the cloud than right next to it. You would need an infinite amount of measure spots to estimate the global water content in the atmosphere. Secondly the water content is around 2%. 2.43% or 2.44% is an increase by less than 1%. But for CO2 a difference between 0,03 and 0,04 is significant enough to be measured.

But we can’t add water to the atmosphere!

I never understood this argument. Ever hang out wet laundry? It dries in the sun. The water doesn’t disappear, it evaporates and is in the atmosphere. If the relative humidity (RH) was 100% the clothes wouldn’t dry. Sweating would be inefficient and you would have fog. At 100% RH you need to heat the air in order to take up more water. However when RH is below 100% it can take up more water. That’s the definition of RH. And as we observe in daily life, 100% RH is not common on surface altitude. That’s how sweating works, water is evaporating from the skin to cool the skin. And that’s possible without heating up the air, otherwise evolution wouldn’t have given us the ability to sweat.

Possible mistakes/errors

* most trivial would be a failed conversion between gigatons, cubic meter, kg etc.. because we are talking about millions of gigatons it’s possible. I think I did it right but maybe double check.
* error in the basic concept: maybe I overlooked something. Most likely the point why humans can’t add water to atmosphere. Many sources claim we have to heat up the air to increase water content. But I don’t understand why. I think it would be true at 100%RH but below we can ofcourse evaporate water as we observe in daily life. In Chile millions of liter of water are pumped to the surface and evaporated by the sun because in the remaining salt Lithium can be found. I think I gave enough example why I think we actually can evaporate water. The claim we can’t sounds so stupid to me, I don’t know why everyone says that.
* some more complex phenomenon is involved. Maybe water evaporated from agriculture has a different life time. A few hours would be enough though. The amount of water evaporation is so much higher than the CO2... Also i don’t see why water vapor from humans would behave different than natural vapor. We are basically just wetting the earths surface. Then the sun does the rest in natural processes.

I think it’s more likely I did a mistake and that most of other scientists are right. However I didn’t find a flaw here. Most people I explained this to blamed me as a sceptic but didn’t have any scientific argument. I’m open to discussion but I hope you are open too and can consider my thoughts scientifically and neutrally even though it’s against the consensus.
Thank you.

"cef8pi","climate","scientific","Climate Change and Heat Waves in India","Today, because of global warming, the world is one degree Celsius warmer than it was before the industrial revolution. According to author Wallace-Wells, if the temperature rises even one more degree, “Cities now home to millions, across India and the Middle East, would become so hot that stepping outside in summer would be a lethal risk.” In India, exposure to heat waves is said to increase by 8 times between 2021 and 2050, and by 300 % by the end of this century. (See article: “Heat wave exposure in India in current, 1.5 °C, and 2.0 °C worlds,” in the journal *Environmental Research Letters)*. The number of Indians exposed to heat waves increased by 200% from 2010 to 2016. Heat waves also affect farm labour productivity.

The heat waves affect central and northwestern India the most, and the eastern coast and Telengana have also been affected. In 2015, the latter places witnessed at least 2500 deaths. For the first time in history, Kerala reported a heat wave in 2016. The government is being advised by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in predicting and mitigating heat waves. The government of Andhra Pradesh, for instance, is creating a Heat Wave Action Plan.

Clearly, heat waves are indicative of the impacts of climate change which needs to be addressed immediately.

"c802l1","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse 2019 q2","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for three and a half year now nick-named [“[Signs of collapse]”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.

I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.

I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.

**1.It is safe:**

There is no harm to us or environment while using renewable energy, like fossil fuels, it doesn’t create any type of radiation or any harmful gases while producing renewable energy. 

**2.It is abundant:**

Renewable energy is present in abundant form it is never ending as compared to fossil fuels which are going to extinct one day for sure. Like for example sun rises every day, waves and winds are going to flow every day too, and we can create much energy through these sources. 

**3.It is clean to use:**

There is no harm in using renewable energy sources it is clean and safe to use. It won’t affect or give raise to pollution or any type of threat that accelerates global warming. Hence, it is clean to use renewable energy in terms of fossil fuels.
