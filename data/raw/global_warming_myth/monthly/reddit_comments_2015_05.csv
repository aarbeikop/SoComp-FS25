* If your study is so concerned with accurate communication, why do you let everyone misquote your results as ""97% of scientists"" instead of the more accurate ""97% of papers we chose to include""?

* Why was your choice of papers so clearly not a representative sample? Why did it include papers about psychology and TV shows?

* How did your reviewers examine 675 scientific papers in just 72 hours? Why did they disagree WITH THE AUTHOR about the point of a reviewed paper about two thirds of the time? Why did you reviewers even disagree with each other one third of the time?

* How did you choose your reviewers? They seem to be a collection of bloggers, activists and other vested interests. Not scientists at all. 

* With respect to the timestamp data you sought to withhold, what comment do you make on the observation that it shows that you collected data, analyzed it, decided to recollect, analyzed again, then decided to change the data classification rules and have another shot at collecting the data once more? Were your results not what you wanted so you started over with shifted goalposts?

* Do you honestly believe that science should just be done by consensus ??


With regard to your Inoculation Theory article:

* Wikipedia says of inoculation theory ""This will hopefully make the receiver actively defensive and allow them to create arguments in favor of their preexisting thoughts"". Is that not just closing minds? Shouldn't people be encouraged to think freely instead of being given preexisting thoughts, and taught to harden against changing their minds?

* Is this anything other than a ploy to associate the popular vaccination movement with your movement? How should you be regarded in scientific circles if you are employing basic marketing tactics like that?

1) The evidence for how the climate will change in the future comes from computer models of the earth correct?  These computer models are theoretically valid only when using microscopic grid sizes.  We know, from industry applications, that these models *usually* give accurate results with grid sizes of several millimeters or centimeters.  We have no experimental or theoretical reason to believe however that these models work with grid sizes in the miles.  These models have shown themselves to be either incorrect or are only correct by virtue of predicting such a wide range of possible answers as to make their predictions unverifiable in the short or medium term.  While these models are the best tool at our disposal would you agree that we lack any way to truly test them at present?

2) Would you agree that while to the average person the argument ""everyone thinks this so you should think it as well"" is a useful rule of thumb, however it is not scientifically relevant what the majority of scientists think.  Would you agree that arguments such as this amount to calls to authority and that scientists who we now consider heroes were themselves almost universally fighting against the calls to authority of their age (which was usually religious).  Do you find it problematic that science today is adopting the same arguments which for hundreds of years were used to put down the world's most significant scientists?

3) Would you agree that typically if science made claims about a system as immensely complex as global climate, made claims that massive action needed to be taken because of extremely long term consequences which were difficult to model, In the ordinary course it would take several decades to test and re-test the models before we would believe such sweeping claims were scientifically valid?

"cqxw9tq","t3_34tcge","34tcge","science","scientific","I've wanted to ask this for a long time. I've been paying attention to climate news for years, and keep hearing worse and worse news. Yet the world is doing nothing. It doesn't make sense.

Here are some things I've heard:

* We'll probably reach 2-3 degrees this century.
* The climate in North Dakota will look more like the southwest US, which would make the Southwest pretty much unlivable.
* the horrible drought that we had in America a couple years ago (where a large percentage of the crops died) will be an average year during the second half of this century
* the permafrost will start to melt, and that could double the amount of greenhouse gases
* the glaciers and the poles are melting faster than previously thought
* it will keep getting worse every year until we get down to zero carbon emmissions

It would take global action on the scale of World War II to prevent climate disaster:

> “Two terawatts of photovoltaic would require installing 100 square meters of 15-percent-efficient solar cells every second, second after second, for the next 25 years. (That’s about 1,200 square miles of solar cells a year, times 25 equals 30,000 square miles of photovoltaic cells.) Two terawatts of solar thermal? If it’s 30 percent efficient all told, we’ll need 50 square meters of highly reflective mirrors every second. (Some 600 square miles a year, times 25.) Half a terawatt of biofuels? Something like one Olympic swimming pools of genetically engineered algae, installed every second. (About 15,250 square miles a year, times 25.) Two terawatts of wind? That’s a 300-foot-diameter wind turbine every 5 minutes. (Install 105,000 turbines a year in good wind locations, times 25.) Two terawatts of geothermal? Build 3 100-megawatt steam turbines every day-1,095 a year, times 25. Three terawatts of new nuclear? That’s a 3-reactor, 3-gigawatt plant every week-52 a year, times 25.”

BUT. The mainstream view seems to be that the worst we'll have to deal with is rising prices of food and water.

Which is it? What's going on? Do I have it wrong? Is it not as bad as I think it is?","2015-05-04 12:54:29","5","[deleted]","1747752888.841679","global warming myth","manual"
"cqxx10b","t3_34tcge","34tcge","science","scientific","Thanks for the AMA, I was wondering about the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference which is happening in Paris, France later this year. I have two questions involving it:

- Do you think that there will be a large consensus as to what should be done? 
- On the issue of climate change denial specifically, are there many that believe it that control power in this situation?

Would be interesting to hear your view. I'll definitely be checking out your books.","2015-05-04 13:25:29","5","Ohlookitsbelbel","1747752888.8427079","global warming myth","manual"

"cqxy0ou","t3_34tcge","34tcge","science","scientific","Hi John, I have been listening to some of the lectures in your MOOC and have found them fascinating so far. It's really exciting to be able to begin to understand why some people hold anti climate science views despite the presence of very convincing evidence, and it gives me hope that maybe we can eventually turn the situation around.   

My question is about anti science beliefs more generally; do you think the psychology behind climate science denial can also explain other types of science denial?

"cqy4f4e","t3_34tcge","34tcge","science","scientific","So you've done a lot of your work studying Climate Change Denial obviously. What if in the next few years Climate Change Deniers fizzle away (doubtful, I know)? What if the overwhelming consensus is that humans are exacerbating climate change and we need to act now to change that. What would you turn your research, your time, your attention to next? 

And what are you actively doing as a professional from a non-academic standpoint to fight climate change and/or climate change deniers? 

**Basically, your very specific field of study relies on the existence of climate change denial so I want to know what, if anything, you are actively doing to get rid of climate change denial. And what is your exit plan from this very niche subject?**","2015-05-04 17:08:23","6","BoBab","1747752888.846199","global warming myth","manual"
