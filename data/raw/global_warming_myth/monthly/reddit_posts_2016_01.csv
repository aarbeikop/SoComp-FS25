"409z4e","collapse","skeptical","The American Middle Class is/was an Aberration.","Modern ideals and virtues of human rights, social justice issues, and the rise of an American middle class have all been aberrations of a civilization built atop a surfeit of energy. With that energy ebbing and environmental costs rising, we’ll see more overt authoritarianism, more forked tongue rabble-rousing, and the general disintegration of social niceties. Quoting from an [essay](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/1/28/1360803/-Who-needs-the-middle-class) in the *liberal and progressive* DailyKos:

>...Here's a view that suggests things it probably was not intended to suggest: [There's Nothing ""Normal"" About A Middle Class](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/1/28/1360803/-Who-needs-the-middle-class)

>>There is nothing ""normal"" about a nation having a middle class, even though it is vital to the survival of democracy.

>>As twenty-three years of conservative economic policies have now shown millions of un- and underemployed Americans, what's ""normal"" in a ""free and unfettered"" economy is the rapid evolution of a small but fabulously wealthy ownership class, and a large but poor working class. In the entire history of civilization, outside of a small mercantilist class and the very few skilled tradesmen who'd managed to organize in guilds (the earliest unions) like the ancient Masons, the middle class was an aberration.

>There's a clue in the sentence: ""There is nothing ""normal"" about a nation having a middle class, even though it is vital to the survival of democracy.""  Let's think about this.  The survival of ""democracy"" depends on the existence of democracy.  If democracy has ceased to exist, if it ever did, then how can it's survival be a reason for anything?  If this sounds silly to you maybe you need to look at our situation a little harder.

>I remember campaigning and giving speeches during presidential campaigns before the Raygun revolution.  I remember trying to convince people that as globalization progressed there was only one way things could go.  It seemed so obvious that with the majority of the people in the world working for so little the American wage structure was more than just vulnerable.  Now we see that the inevitable has been progressing as we often seem to forget that it was predicted and more or less had to come.

>The existence of a global economy is  the existence of a very complex system that can absorb any potential threat to its stability.  Piketty has more or less established that the WWII and post war era was an anomaly in the way capitalism develops.  The United States has held on to a very unique and precarious position within that system.  A small percentage of the world's population has managed to swim against a rising tide of entropy tending to erase the differences.  Now that the post WWII situation has all but disappeared, there is no reason to believe that the entropic forces won't prevail.

>**Have you wondered why the oligarchy can deny global warming?  Do you really believe they are so stupid as to miss what is so obvious?  No, they are ready.  They have plans and they know how they will survive.  Meanwhile a lot of their problems will be solved as the catastrophe progresses.**

>They also probably scoff at the ""rebuilding"" of the American economy for it is too much an economy that is going extinct like so much of the life on earth.  The system has forced itself into a corner where change is inevitable and it won't be pretty.

>Meanwhile we are framing our politics around a series of obvious myths.  The middle class has nothing in this system to sustain it.  What kind of economic system will allow it to just go on as in the past?  If I could ever find reason to believe that our political activity had any chance of changing what is happening I would feel a lot better.

>So who does need the middle class?  Clearly the present leadership of the democratic party professes to.  Yet as the scenario plays itself out I wonder how much they believe in this idea.  It seems clear to me that there is a lot of mythology out there and very little facing the facts.  Yes there are climate deniers and they are dangerous.    More dangerous in some ways are those who deny the realities of our time.  We can not just go back to the kind of economy we had.  It is destroying the planet's ability to sustain us.  

>So what needs to be done?  We need to think about how we can live on the planet without making the conditions for that life impossible.  That means very radical changes in the way we feed and house and clothe ourselves.  That means that toys are too expensive to use as a means of driving the economy.

>Hope for solar and wind energy are a mixed bag if that energy is used in ways that worsen the situation.  First and foremost we need to provide food and shelter and sensible health care to everyone and there can be no class distinctions here.  Never have I mentioned ""jobs"" for they are part of what is bringing us down.  Sustaining is not a ""job"", it is living.

>The middle class is living in a dream world and is part of the problem.  It certainly is not the solution.  The context in which the concept has meaning is lethal.  We need radical change and we need it to start in the way we are thinking about these things.

>We could run this by some Native people or others who are not so deeply caught up into the myths that drive us.  I don't think they would have a problem getting my point.  We really have little time but we have some.  Or we can wait and let what is coming sweep over us.  We really do not need a weather man to know which way the wind is blowing.

A radical restructuring of society that avoids catastrophic environmental crises is not happening. In this century, 90% of global population growth is projected to occur in cities which account for 80% of carbon dioxide emissions and 75% of energy consumption. The COP21 climate agreement is a façade for business-as-usual. [Large gas-guzzling vehicles](http://grist.org/business-technology/what-climate-with-cheap-gas-auto-sales-spike/) are again fashionable with today's low gas prices. I work with native people in Arizona and I'm afraid running this issue by them will only elicit blank stares as they get in their pickup truck for a trip to the local big-box grocery store.
