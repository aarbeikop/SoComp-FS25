A buddy of mine sent me this link regarding CO2 and how an EMC engineer utilized his knowledge of RF and IR radiation and its interaction with CO2 to question whether or not CO2 is a significant greenhouse gas. It reads out like the Saturation Myth, but the writer refutes that criticism of his thesis with his own findings.

I'm convinced that the article's evidence for its thesis is somehow flawed, but I don't have the proper knowledge to really discuss and refute it. Can an expert point out the fallacies in this article? Ignore the author's political rant at the beginning, I'm just trying create a counter-argument for my climate denier friend.

Fossil emissions are going down 1% / 10 years, as part of total world energy demand.

Fossil emissions must go down **100% in 20 years** to stay below 2° C says Stefan Rahmstorf. 

James Hansen says 2° C = DISASTER, and Kevin Anderson says we have a 5% chance of success. 

This means we have 95% chance of not avoiding disaster in 20 years.

Global Energy Demand & Carbon Emissions Increase In 2017 

https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/22/global-energy-demand-carbon-emissions-increase-2017/

A new report finds that none of the negative emission technologies has the potential to deliver carbon removals at the gigaton (Gt) scale and at the rate of deployment envisaged by the IPCC, including reforestation, afforestation, carbon-friendly agriculture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, or direct air capture and carbon storage (DACCs).""

"88s8mb","sustainability","action-oriented","Signs of collapse q1 2018","Hi /r/Sustainability! I have been working on an ongoing project for little over two years now nick-named [”[Signs of collapse]”]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TZM/comments/5l3ik4/signs_of_collapse_summary_of_the_year_2016/). Even if we strive for and dream of a sustainable world, a lot of things are becoming worse. And I think in order to reach a world that is truly sustainable, it's imperative that we fully understand where we are now and which path we are on. To progress, we have to identify the problems and accept them for what they are if we wish to have any chance addressing them.
 
I try my best to not make this series into a rant about every little problem or mishap that’s going on. Even in a sustainable society accidents would happen and natural catastrophes would occur, seasons would vary in intensity from year to year and so on. So what I present here is my best attempt at distilling out anthropogenic anomalies.

I define a “sign of collapse” as a negative market externality that the current socioeconomic system for whatever reason hasn’t dealt with and is now ending up hurting people or the ecosystem. I try to pick studies and news that shows the occurring consequences of the current system’s failure to deal with externalities.
 
I’m also trying to make the argument, and feel free to disagree with me and have a discussion, that urgent action is needed now and there's close to no upper limit to how radically environmentalist one can reasonably become at the present time. If you want to do something, you better hurry before it’s too late.
