This wasn't true [when those claims were first aimed at the Prius](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/2kou6r/does_anyone_know_what_happens_to_the_batteries/clnlkue/), and this isn't true [for EVs now either](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903729a).  Properly-done lifecycle analyses, like those [the Union of Concerned Scientists](https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner), [Transport & Environment](https://www.transportenvironment.org/press/electric-cars-emit-less-co2-over-their-lifetime-diesels-even-when-powered-dirtiest-electricity), and Notter et al (linked to earlier) demonstrate that EVs have a lower carbon footprint than normal cars even if you account for the batteries.

>Jonathan Eckart of the World Economic Forum wrote that “electric vehicles can generate more carbon emissions over their lifecycle

And the Financial Times' article he quotes [compares a 100 kWh Tesla Model S to a much smaller and slower Mitsubishi Mirage in the worst possible locale for EVs](https://www.ft.com/content/a22ff86e-ba37-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852) to make that claim.  It's a blatantly cherry-picked case.","2019-04-25 18:22:37","5","disembodied_voice","1747800881.261067","global warming myth","manual"

It follows that the manufacturing process must be decarbonised, say, by relying on thorium-based nuclear power and on hydrogen-fuelled maritime transport, among other things.

>even though we have the technology to safely recycle these harmful materials, many companies won’t pursue it because it has no financial benefit.

If so, then state intervention is required.

Biofuels not only generate GHG emissions with their burning, but contribute to deforestation and to the deterioration of land.","2019-04-25 17:08:26","2","In_der_Tat","1747800881.2652311","global warming myth","manual"

"els3hmx","t3_bh6mk8","bh6mk8","sustainability","action-oriented","So, here's the real trick.

If you're looking for the ""perfect solution to transportation"" that solution is already made. The bicycle. There's simply no more efficient way of getting around, the manufacture of the things is a drop in the bucket compared to *anything* else, they're cheap and readily available.

And you'll get people of the rich nations of the world out of cars and onto bicycles shortly after all seven games of the Stanley Cup Finals are played on the fresh new skating rink in hell. Believe me, I spent most of my adult life advocating for this change. I showed everyone in my social circle that it's entirely possible to go so far as raising kids with no car; Trips to school, daycare, and the grocery store were all accomplished on two wheels and a trailer, every single day for years. 

And in that time, I convinced exactly nobody to make the change. With the exception of one exceptional environmentalist, they all thought I was a bizarre freak of nature for even attempting it, let alone being able to *do* it. 

So essentially, we're stuck with the motor vehicle as we know it. 

Stop whining that electric cars aren't the perfect solution. EVs that are powered by zero emissions electricity (yes, that includes nuclear power) are far and away better than burning gas to get around. If you have an issue (or hear other people complain that one exists) about where that electricity comes from, **change that too.** We can convert to electric cars at exactly the same time as we convert from coal-and-gas-generated electricity to hydro, nuclear, and wind. 

The world doesn't need perfect solutions. It needs better solutions, and after that, we can make even better ones again. Constant improvement beats waiting around for something that will never come, or is flat-out impossible.","2019-04-25 21:35:15","1","gromm93","1747800881.2702909","global warming myth","manual"
