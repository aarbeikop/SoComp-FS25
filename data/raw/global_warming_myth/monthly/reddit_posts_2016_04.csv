"4h19x0","climate","scientific","There's even a consensus on the scientific consensus","It's  unbelievable that scientists are having to conduct studies to prove that there is only a tiny handful of people in scientific fields who disagree with the [scientific consensus on global climate change,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change) which is that our planet's climate is changing, and the primary cause of that change is man.

Indeed, the shining example of the ""dumbing down"" of Americans is the number of people who don't understand that a scientific consensus has been reached on global climate change.  That consensus, which all the available evidence supports and with which virtually no leading climate scientists in the world disagree, is that the Earth's climate is unequivocally warming, and it is **more than 90%** certain that humans are causing it through activities that increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels.

Indeed, those few scientists who disagree with that consensus have been completely unable to show why they are correct in the peer-reviewed literature.  That's the reason they're not believed; it has nothing to do with some kind of conspiracy among the majority of world's scientists to perpetrate a fraud.

Researchers who have felt it necessary to prove (by science) that the scientific consensus on global warming does, indeed, include more than 90% of the world's climate scientists have shown that the consensus now is nearly unanimous among those who are professionals in the field. The belief that scientists are divided over the question of global warming must be the greatest scientific myth in the United States (and nowhere else, I might add).

This recent study concluded that ""the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies"":

And James Lawrence Powell, of the National Physical Science Consortium, Los Angeles, published a report last month in the Bulletin of Science Technology & Society, a peer-reviewed science journal that is intended as a professional journal for all types of scientists, about all fields of science; and intended for those who choose careers in any of those fields, which stated:

> During 2013 and 2014, only 4 of 69,406 authors of peer-reviewed articles on global warming, 0.0058% or 1 in 17,352, rejected AGW. Thus, the consensus on AGW among publishing scientists is above **99.99%,** verging on unanimity. The U.S. House of Representatives holds 40 times as many global warming rejecters as are found among the authors of scientific articles. **The peer-reviewed literature contains no convincing evidence against AGW.**

**Hello there, /r/Science!**

We* are a group of researchers who just [published a meta-analysis](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002) of expert agreement on humans causing global warming. 

The lead author John Cook has a video backgrounder on the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEb49cZYnsEl), and articles in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/consensus-confirmed-over-90-of-climate-scientists-believe-were-causing-global-warming-57654) and [Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](http://thebulletin.org/yes-there-really-scientific-consensus-climate-change9332). Coauthor Dana Nuccitelli also did a background post on his blog at the Guardian [here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming). 

You may have heard the statistic “97% of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming.” You may also have wondered where that number comes from, or even have heard that it was “debunked”. This metanalysis looks at a wealth of surveys (of scientists as well as the scientific literature) about scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, and [finds that among climate experts, the ~97% level among climate experts is pretty robust](http://i.imgur.com/oCevIhE.jpg). 

The upshot of our paper is that [the level of agreement with the consensus view increases with expertise](http://i.imgur.com/L7xpRny.png). 

When people claim the number is lower, they usually do so by cherry-picking the responses of groups of non-experts, such as [petroleum geologists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/02/14/james-taylor-misinterprets-study-by-180-degrees/) or [weathercasters](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/dec/02/meteorologists-global-warming-consensus). 

Why does any of this matter? Well, there is a growing body of scientific literature that shows the public’s perception of scientific agreement is a “gateway belief” for their attitudes on environmental questions (e.g. [Ding et *al.*, 2011](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html, [Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141), [van der Linden *et al.*, 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489), and more). In other words, if the public thinks scientists are divided on an issue, that causes the public to be less likely to agree that a problem exists and makes them less willing to do anything about it. Making sure the public understands the high level of expert agreement on this topic allows the public dialog to advance to more interesting and pressing questions, like what as a society we decided to do about the issue. 

We're here to answer your questions about this paper and more general, related topics. We ill be back later to answer your questions, Ask us anything!
